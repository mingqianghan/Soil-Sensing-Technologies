	abstract = {A Peltier type water content sensor was developed to measure media with high nutrient concentrations. The water content sensor using temperature has the advantage that the effect of ion concentration is small compared to time-domain-reflectometry and capacitance-type sensors. Compared to other superheat sensors that measure heat conduction time, proposed sensor had the advantages of shorter measurement time because it measured specific heat and no change of average temperature of the plant medium because heating and cooling are performed simultaneously. In addition, in order to detect temperature changes with high sensitivity, we developed a driving method that repeats heating and cooling, and realized a circuit that accumulates temperature change signals. Experiments on a model soil were successful in obtaining a change of 186 mV per 10\% water content.},

The measurement method based on soil dielectric properties has been the most potential measurement method. However, many soil water sensors based on the dielectric properties are not accurate because of the influence soil texture or structure. How the electromagnetic frequency affected the soil dielectric properties was studied by selecting the different frequency in the different soil texture or structure. The results of experiment show that the soil texture or structure have great influence on the soil dielectric properties in the low-frequency or the medium frequency, however, it has almost unaffected on the soil dielectric properties in the high-frequency or the very high frequency. Therefore, according to the soil texture and selecting the optimal frequency, the accuracy of the soil water sensor is greatly improved.},

The results show that: (1) there is a significant change of N0 between growing season and harvesting season for winter wheat and summer maize. Therefore, N0 needs to be recalibrated when land cover changes. (2) CRNS method can capture the variations of SWC. However, during the period of rainfall and irrigation, SWC is usually overestimated.

It is shown that, with the desired signal frequency of 20 MHz, the physical problems have significantly been reduced and that, even with water conductivity of up to \${\textbackslash}sigma = 2{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}hbox\{S/m\}\$, reliable results can be obtained.},

The sensors were compared by evaluating the characteristics of reflected waveforms from a (200-ps) step pulse in different media, including air, triethylene glycol, deionized water, and over a range of water contents in sand and a clay loam soil. Sensors with greater separation between electrodes, achieved by means different tube diameters or the separation angles, tend to have greater field penetration in both sand and clay. In addition, sensors with the shortest electrode separation show greater sensitivity to soil electrical conductivity. Together, these trends demonstrate that the propagating electromagnetic fields above 0 Hz do not take the transverse electromagnetic form commonly assumed in the analysis of TDR probes.},

Most of the available methods to gauge soil moisture content are tedious and expensive. Water content of the soil will affect the soil electric properties. In GPR system, the soil electrical properties will affect the received reflected wave. Detailed information about Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) reflected wave propagation is potentially useful for extracting the soil water content.

	abstract = {In agriculture and plantations, soil water content significantly affects growth, productivity, and sustainability. Soil water content is important information for agriculture and plantation. Direct measurement of soil water content, such as the gravimetric method on large areas, requires time and cost. The remote sensing technology can potentially be applied for measuring a large area. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) has been studied to measure soil water content. However, the presence of vegetation can act as an obstacle and significantly influence the detection results. This influence can cause a decrease in the accuracy of the detection results. Therefore, the presence of vegetation needs to be considered in estimating the soil water content. This paper proposes an extraction method for estimating soil water content considering the presence of vegetation. The proposed method is applied for the Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) system employed as a radar system used in soil water content estimation. The theoretical and simulation analysis was conducted to investigate the proposed method. The results show that the proposed method overcomes the problem of vegetation in soil water content estimation. The accuracy improvement that obtains is about 4.248\%. The proposed method also performs well in the low SNR condition.},

The soil water contents were measured at selected typical sample plots within the 5m, 10m and 16 m belt-space caragana -grass compound systems. The soil water contents in the 5m belt-space system were found to be the lowest among the three systems, to decrease with soil depth, also to decrease with distance from caragana belt, to vary greatly from month to month, and to decrease sharply in September due to the over consumption of soil water. The soil water contents in the 10m belt-space system were highest among the three systems, increased with the soil depth, fluctuated greatly from month to month, and also decreased sharply in September. The use of soil water by vegetation in this system was not close to its potential, nor is it balanced. The soil water contents in the 16m belt-space system were at median level among the three systems, were highest at the soil depth where the majority of roots locate, were relatively balanced in horizontal distribution, and had very small monthly changes. Therefore, the 16m belt-space caragana-grass compound system had the best soil water content distributions that enabled the full use of soil water by both caragana and within belt-space plants, and should be the one recommended for adoption in this area.},

Hyper-spectral remote sensing can be used to detect slight differences in soil moisture because of high-resolution and multi-band in spectral. Taking black soil in Jilin Province of China as the research object, this paper analyzed soil hyper-spectral characteristics and extracted parameters by using methods of spectral differentiation, feature-band extraction and multiple stepwise regression analysis. The relationship between soil moisture and soil spectra was analyzed combining with soil moisture laboratory measurement. Five models were used to quantitative inversion in order to seek soil moisture monitoring by applying hyper-spectral remote sensing. The conclusion was as follows: ➀in the below field water holding capacity condition, the sensitive bands of black soil spectral reflectance and its reciprocal and logarithmic transformation mainly focused in 400–470nm, 1950–2050nm and 2100–2200nm. The highest correlation coefficient between laboratory spectral data and soil moisture reached to 0.89 at 2156nm; ➁The best prediction model of black soil moisture content by using hyper-spectral remote sensing was Y = 22.16 + 26278.2x1328−47785.1x1439− 201.42x1742 + 49306.34x2156, x= (lgR)′, Y representing soil moisture content (\%), coefficient of determination was 0.931.},

The DWC similarity measure incorporates both direction and distance information of feature vectors. Meanwhile, a mixed-integer optimization problem is formulated to determine hyperparameters. An extended Rao-1 algorithm, I-Rao-1 algorithm, is developed to solve such optimization problems. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, three soil moisture data sets collected from the Florida research trials are employed. Compared with state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method has achieved the best performance based on all data sets in terms of the highest accuracy, precision, and recall values.

There will be two types of soil tested: a loam soil that is often sold for potted plants and a soil sample taken from a test field. The jar method was used to investigate the type of soil and the gravimetric method was used to calibrate the sensors. In this method, the soil samples are completely dried in the sun, moisture is gradually added while the weight of the soil is recorded each time, and the sample is then sun-dried and measured once more to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. The results of the trials show that the field sample is sandy loam, while the marketed soil is loamy sand.

The system under development is an outgrowth of a network analyzer-based L, C, and X band polarimetric radar system developed jointly by NASA/GSFC and the George Washington University. The system is mounted on a 19-m hydraulic boom truck and has provided reliable calibrated radar data in soil moisture field campaigns across the United States since the early 1990's. The truck instrument system is now being upgraded with the addition of a dual polarized 1.4 GHz total power radiometer. The new system includes a temperature monitoring and control system to keep the radiometer at a constant temperature. All front-end components have been placed on an aluminium plate whose temperature stability has been achieved by using Peltier cells. Periodic switching to the internal noise sources is used to reduce the influence of gain variations in the output voltage. A novel broadband stacked-patch dual-polarized feed resonates at both the 1.4 GHz radiometer and 1.25 GHz radar frequencies, enabling both the radar and the radiometer to share the same 1.22-m parabolic dish antenna. Having the radar and radiometer utilize the same antenna with the same 12deg field of view greatly simplifies the development of active/passive microwave retrieval algorithms. With these new capabilities, ComRAD will be an important tool in examining Earth science research topics such as the synergistic effects between active/passive microwave sensors for soil moisture estimation in the presence of vegetation},

However the DPHP sensor is cost effective as compared to the capacitive sensor. The resistive sensor identifies the moisture content into four bands namely dry, low, medium and high. This sensor is the cheapest when compared to the other two sensors. Energy consumption of resistive sensor is 600mJ per hour, with measurement time of 15min.

The deployed DPHP sensor has two probes: a heater probe and a temperature probe spaced 3 mm apart. Change in the temperature, due to heating, is a function of the soil moisture content. DPHP sensor is integrated with a low power instrumentation board (5mW) for signal amplification, which stores the data in a micro SD card. System automatically turns on the DPHP sensor as well as the instrumentation board at every 1 hour interval for 3 minutes heating cycle, 3 minutes cooling cycle and 54 minutes sleep cycle. Average power consumption during heating cycle is 170mW, one of the lowest powers reported till date. Li-ion battery rated at 3.7V, 1150 mAh capacity is used to power the entire system. The battery is charged by a solar panel, fixed on the top of the system and rated at 6V and 450mA. A PYTHON based GUI is developed for data analysis and presentation utility. Since moisture measurement depends on the structure, mineral and porosity of the soil the system is equipped with a data base in the form of look up tables (LUTs), already produced for various common types of agricultural soil. These LUTs are used for mapping the measured values of change in the temperature from the proposed system to the corresponding soil moisture content. The developed system is able to measure soil moisture content ranging from 1\% to 40\%. This paper also presents the charging and discharging profile of the battery during in-situ field testing, automatically generated by the system.},

The identification of landslide hazard warning areas is necessary to prevent landslide disasters. Soil moisture is one of the factors. Common methods of surveying this soil moisture content include borings and satellites. However, borehole investigations may omit areas that truly need to be investigated without a priori knowledge of the locations to be measured. In addition, it is difficult to specify the timing of measurements in satellite surveys. Therefore, this research aims to establish a system that is safe, wide-ranging, and capable of setting the timing and range of measurement as needed. One approach to meet these requirements is to mount sensors on remotely operated vehicles to measure soil moisture content. In general, vehicles for such purposes need to travel in rough environments, and in order to travel well in rough environments, it is necessary to detect abnormal driving conditions such as slipping or skidding. For this purpose, we develop a sensor monitoring for the vehicle traveling in rough terrain and through forest.},

Preliminary results show that the total gamma flux seen by the sensor is also influenced by variations in atmospheric radon concentrations. Therefore, the total gamma count cannot be used as a proxy for soil moisture and spectral analysis is needed to filter out the radon-induced noise and correlate the 40K and 232Th concentration with the soil moisture content.

To significantly improve the efficiency of irrigation water, an antenna sensor, with high sensitivity and wide range, is proposed to measure the soil water content (SWC) wirelessly. When the SWC changes, the resonant frequency of the antenna will shift. By reading the resonant frequency of the antenna sensor, the SWC can be measured and transmitted wirelessly. The antenna sensor has a wider detection range of SWC, ranging from 10\% to 44\%, and a novel metamaterial structure electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) is designed and its function in improving sensitivity is verified. Furthermore, by sputtering 60-nm-thick SiO2 film on the surface of the antenna patch, its sensitivity has also been greatly improved. When the SiO2 film is sputtered on the antenna sensor, its sensitivity is 7.2 MHz/\% and 7.6 MHz/\% when the SWC is 10\%–29\% and 30\%–44\%, respectively. In summary, this work contributes to methods and instruments for wireless measurement of the SWC.},

To this purpose, a bi-functional system based on a modified commercial capacitive sensor and an AD5933 impedance converter integrated circuit is described. The considered frequency range for impedance measurements is equal to 10-100 kHz, which is a "low-frequency" range compared with typical operating frequencies of a professional system dedicated to water content measurements. For the sensor, a low-frequency Finite Element Modelling simulation of its electrical behavior has also been considered with the aim to understand how its measured admittance correlates with frequency, soil permittivity, and water conductivity.},

Combining the theory of thermal inertia and triangle method, the apparent thermal inertia and fractional vegetation cover can construct a triangular space. In this space, SMSI can be determined easily. Validation was performed with in situ measurements for 19 meteorological stations in the study area. Results indicated that the method can obtain the accurate soil water status that reflects the variation in soil moisture to some extent and is suitable for monitoring the regional surface soil moisture.},

In this work we proposed a model of the received signal after demodulation and demultiplexing. We deduce from this model a MAP estimate of the navigation message and of the signal SNR. In our case the signal model is a piecewise stationary process with change instants at bit edge position.

In the past decade, its potential has increased yearly, with improved receivers and signal processors, from generic GNSS receivers whose signals were recorded in magnetic tapes to instruments that measure full Delay Doppler Maps (the power distribution of the reflected GNSS signal over the 2-D space of delay offsets and Doppler shifts) in real time. At present, these techniques are considered to be promising tools to retrieve geophysical parameters such as soil moisture, vegetation height, topography, altimetry, sea state and ice and snow thickness, among others. This paper focuses on the land geophysical retrievals (topography, vegetation height and soil moisture) performed from a ground-based instrument using the Interference Pattern Technique (IPT). This technique consists of the measurement of the power fluctuations of the interference signal resulting from the simultaneous reception of the direct and the reflected GNSS signals. The latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field is shown in this paper. After a review of the previous results, this paper presents the latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field. This new study provides a deeper analysis on the soil moisture retrieval by observing three irrigation-drying cycles and comparing them to different depths soil moisture probes. Furthermore, the height of the maize, almost 300 cm, has allowed testing the capabilities of the technique over dense and packed vegetation layers, with high vegetation water content.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key factor in climate, hydrology, and agronomy. Its assessment is therefore important and constitutes an alert parameter for desertification. It impacts the heat and mass transfers between soil and atmosphere. However, information access in the regional or global scale is very complicated which usually leads to a rough estimate, or completely disregard of this parameter. Today, remote sensing offers a solution to this problem by providing access to this information through the satellite images. The use of geospatial data to generate adequate information on droughts, we applied the remote sensing method based on the use of the Soil Moisture Index (SMI), which in its algorithm uses the data obtained from satellite sensors. As reported by Hunt et al., The index is based on actual water content (), water capacity and wilting point. The multispectral satellite images from the visible (red band) and infrared (near-infrared and thermal band) bands are essential for the calculation of the index, which is why we used Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS in this context, then SMOS disaggregated data is chosen to be compared with SMI and MI (Moisture Index) used in this work. On the other side, drought monitoring in Morocco faces complexity in the evidence that it depends on a lot of parameters including the SM. Thus, the aim of this paper is firstly to analyze the spatiotemporal variation of SM from SMOS in Casablanca-Settat region of Morocco site during five successive years 2013 to 2017. For that, the first temporal SM values mapping of the study area is established for each year of 2013 to 2017. Next, for each year we will compare SM from SMOS with SMI by drawing the graph line of SM variability in this period and generating differences maps. Secondly, we will evaluate the effect and the impact of Soil Moisture Index (SMI) in Drought monitoring by calculation of Land Surface Temperature (LST) from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, and define which indexes are more indicated for assessing soil conditions.},

	abstract = {In order to explore the disturbance effect of mining subsidence on the vegetation and soil moisture in mining area, using the remote sensing data of the 2007-2017 years in Shaanxi Bin Chang mining area, this paper builds the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index model by establishing the characteristic space, and the changes of vegetation and soil moisture in the mining subsidence area and no-mining affected area were monitored and analyzed. According to the subsidence range and damage degree during the 2007-2017 years in the study area, the depth of crack and the area of crack area in the mining subsidence area are determined, and the disturbance effect of soil moisture change caused by mining subsidence is discussed. The analysis shows that due to the loose surface layer caused by surface cracks, the absorption and evaporation effect of surface water is aggravated, and the soil moisture in the subsidence area is higher than that in the non-subsidence area in the low temperature season of January. In the high temperature season of July, the evaporation degree of the subsidence area is higher than that in the non-subsidence area, and the relative soil moisture is lower than that in the non-subsidence area. This fully reflects the change of surface soil environment caused by coal mining subsidence. The above research results have guiding significance for land evaluation and environmental improvement in coal mining subsidence area in Western China.},

Consequently, we have developed an airborne passive microwave sensing capability at P-band to develop a new state-of-the-art satellite concept that will provide soil moisture data for the top 10 cm layer of soil using radiometer observations at P-band (40 cm; 750 MHz). Not only would P-band provide soil moisture information on a soil layer thickness that more closely relates to that affecting crop and pasture growth, but it is expected to produce greater spatial coverage with improved accuracy to that from L-band. This is because P-band should be less affected by surface roughness conditions and have a reduced attenuation by the overlaying vegetation. This paper describes a series of small airborne field experiments at P-band, and presents some early results of P-band passive microwave observations in comparison with L-band and K-band passive microwave from initial trial flights.},

	abstract = {With the rapid development of China's economy, there is a rapid increase in demand for mineral resources, and a growing strength of mineral resources development, it will inevitably lead to many environmental problems such as geological environmental disasters, air pollution, etc. Mining environmental issues increasingly become the focus of attention. Soil moisture is one of the key indicators to monitor soil quality of mining area. It is a sensitive indicator of the health factors of the ecological environment and particularly of great importance in land reclamation of mining area. With the development of remote sensing technology, RS has been widely used in mine monitoring. RS can be used effectively in real-time, dynamic, large-scale soil moisture monitoring, it's of great significance to environmental protection and remediation. In this paper, four scenes of Landsat remote sensing images have been selected to make remote sensing quantitative analysis of soil moisture in Nanfen, Benxi City, Liaoning Province, an open-air iron mine Nanfen Opencast. Four images' time series were May 18, 2002, May 29, 2006, June 25, 2010, June 4, 2014. The soil moisture temporal and spatial variation features of Nanfen Opencast have been reflected by The SMMI (soil moisture monitoring index) index basing on SWIR-Nir feature space from 2002 to 2014. The NDVI index has been used to verify the soil moisture result. The result provided a basis for the study of environment monitoring in Nanfen Opencast, and provided a scientific basis for decision making of economic development and environmental protection in this region.},

Two case studies pertaining to the Nebraska and California states of the United States are presented. In Nebraska, using the 1995–2010 data, the soil moisture estimates were found to be significantly correlated (Coeff. of correlation = 0.56) with the yield of maize, the main crop of Nebraska. In California, using the 1997–2013 data, the soil moisture estimates were found to be strongly positively correlated with precipitation (Coeff. of corr. = 0.77), and the yields of walnuts (Coeff. of corr. = 0.61), oranges (Coeff. of corr. = 0.40), lemons (Coeff. of corr. = 0.32), almonds (Coeff. of corr. = 0.31) and pistachios (Coeff. of corr. = 0.15). The reliability of these relationships could be improved by confining the analysis to counties that have significant number of acres planted for respective crops. It is concluded that the soil moistures estimates is an important source of the data that can be used for improving crop models and for assessing agricultural drought impacts and thereby improving drought management.},

Fertilizers are normally recommended based on the nutrient present in the soil. To recommend a suitable fertilizer level, the soil nutrient analysis is essential which is done mostly using laboratory techniques. Manual methods of measuring soil nutrients are time consuming. Many farmers refrain to perform soil testing in the laboratory and grow the same crop in the land continuously, hence soil loses its fertility. A system has been proposed to adopt precision agriculture using Wireless Sensor Networks, which enables remote monitoring of soil fertility and other parameters namely soil moisture, pH and temperature. This data is transmitted to the cloud and the corresponding values are displayed on a mobile application. The proposed Internet of things (IoT) based software system has the intelligence to recommend the quantity of water and fertilizer which improves the quality of the soil and ensures optimum growth of the crop.},

This technique was tested in Hengshan County, northern Shanxi Province of China. The soil reflectance properties of samples were measured in the laboratory by ASD field spectrometer. The correlation analysis related with nitrogen content was processed with the spectral reflectance factors (the first derivative reflectance, the logarithmic reflectance and absorption depth). The results show that the first derivative reflectance at sensitive bands of 480nm, 980nm and 2210nm has more notable correlation coefficient as compared to other parameters. Knowing these correlations we were able to build up the multivariate regression model and map the soil total nitrogen content by calculating each pixel of Hyperion image. The accuracy assessment by relating predicted nitrogen values with measured ones of a linear regression showed that the map is reliable and significantly correlative with known stabilization processes throughout the study area. Moreover, this quantitative methodology developed in this study for mapping soil total nitrogen content can also be applied to other regions throughout the world.},

This letter analyzes the role of multisource remote sensing observations on the upscaling of soil moisture observed by a wireless sensor network at the pixel scale via the regression kriging (RK) method. Three types of auxiliary remote sensing information are employed, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI; 90 m), Polarimetric L-band Multiband Radiometer brightness temperature (700 m), and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer TVDI (1000 m). Moreover, a comparison with the ordinary kriging method is analyzed. The spatial inferences show that the RK method is more accurate and that its spatial pattern is more consistent with the auxiliary data when the trend is successfully removed, particularly when spatial continuity is destroyed by irrigation. The ASTER TVDI has a higher resolution and stronger correlation with soil moisture and yields more accurate interpolation results than the other types of remote sensing information. Although medium-resolution data do not substantially contribute to capture the spatial patterns of soil moisture, such data may still improve the prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {Collecting field soil moisture information is the foundation of auto-irrigation. This paper introduced a soil moisture monitoring wireless sensor network (WSN) and with application background of automatic drip irrigation for cotton field. Firstly, application background was analyzed and application requirements were defined. The system worked together with a drip irrigation system in cotton field. In the second part, the frame of the system was given. It was composed of battery-powered field sensor nodes, solar powered WSN-GPRS gateway and data manage server. Hardware structure of the sensor node was introduced in details. Theoretical foundation of the design was introduced. After study, it was found that the soil moisture in a certain size of area was very nearly, which lead to the possibility of network data compression. In the third part, a novel data compression algorithm was proposed. In the algorithm, all the sensor nodes were encoded with Morton code and a logical multi-lays cluster was constructed among the nodes. Making use of the similarity of the output of the sensor nodes, the power cost was reduced significantly and prolongs life of the network. A power saving mode was introduced which made the network have a good flexibility. More sensor nodes had little impact on the network as Greedy Perimeter Stateless Routing (GPSR) algorithm was used to routing data. At last, some test and experiments results were shown in diagrammatic form. The system was field tested over six month period (April 2009 to Oct. 2009) in Xin-jiang province of China. The experimental results demonstrated that large scale, long-term collecting of soil moisture information can be achieved by using our proposed system.},

The link quality, RSSI, network lifetime and number of packet drops are measured for both single-hop and multi-hop topologies.

In this sensor web, satellite sensors (i.e., GF-1), in-situ sensors (i.e., BDS-R), and wireless sensor networks were firstly coupled by sensor web based cyber infrastructure. Then multi-sensor collaboration methods were designed to make full use of these different monitoring capabilities. In addition, web processing service was utilized to achieve online soil moisture estimating, fusing, and mapping. Finally, an integrated online service platform was constructed to query and display all soil moisture related resources. The experiments conducted in Hubei province demonstrated that this region's agricultural soil moisture monitoring capability was improved in terms of spatial-temporal continuity and accuracy.

	abstract = {The use of low-cost embedded devices with ubiquitous connectivity systems is a possible strategy to monitor the consumption of water used in agriculture even in countries that do not have good economic resources. In this article, we propose a low-cost system based on a measuring approach of capacitive soil water content (SWC) sensors never explored previously. This solution takes advantage of the sensor properties to respond to the need to measure at the same time salinity and soil volumetric water content. For this purpose, a bifunctional system based on a modified commercial capacitive sensor and an AD5933 impedance converter integrated circuit (IC) is described. The considered frequency range for impedance measurements is 10–100 kHz, which is a “low-frequency” range compared with typical operating frequencies of professional systems devoted to water content measurements. Measurements are carried out to check the system accuracy and to characterize the impedance of the sensor both in the air and in water, which represent the two boundaries of possible operating conditions in physical soils in terms of the real part of the electrical permittivity. Variations of the imaginary part of the electrical permittivity are taken into account using water with conductivity between 1 and  \$2300{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}mu {\textbackslash}text\{S\}\$ /cm. Experimental results are compared with the measurements obtained by using a laboratory inductance in honor of Heinrich Lenz, capacitance and resistance (LCR) meter, and a maximum error of +6.12\% for the capacitance and +5.6\% for the conductance is obtained. The proposed system is also employed to characterize silica sandy soil with different water contents and conductivities showing quite promising results useful to overcome the well-known limits of low-cost SWC sensors.},

	doi = {10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2019.8820504},
	abstract = {The rapid development of industrialized agriculture has leads to the problems of soil pollution and water pollution. In order to solve these problems, precision agriculture (PA) has been applied to achieve precise management of agricultural water and fertilizer. In PA process, fine mapping of soil nutrient is an effective technology to acquire accurate water and fertilizer distribution information and make agricultural decision. A significant progress has been made in digital soil mapping (DSM) of soil nutrient content over the past 20 years. However, the accuracy of grid-based DSM cannot meet the practical application needs of PA. This paper proposed a fine DSM method of soil nutrient content using high resolution remote sensing images and multi-scale auxiliary data for PA application. Three key technologies were studied for the implementation of this method. The automatic extraction of fine mapping units was the basis of this method. We designed different automatic extraction methods based on high resolution remote sensing images for agricultural production units in plains and mountainous areas. The auxiliary variables in different scales were chosen and converted to construct fine-scale soil nutrient-environment relationship model. Finally, machine learning methods were used to map the spatial distribution of soil nutrients. We chose Zhongning County, Ningxia Province as the study area, which includes typical plain and mountainous agriculture. The proposed method and technologies were applied for typical soil nutrients mapping. A common grid-based spatial interpolation method was implemented with the same soil sample dataset to evaluate the effect of the proposed method. The result showed that this method could reduce the number of prediction units and effectively improve the prediction efficiency in both plain and mountainous areas for fine soil mapping and precision agriculture application. This study was an attempt to realize fine soil mapping based on PA application unit in different environments. The high-resolution remote sensing images provide basic data for the realization of this idea, and the conversion technology of multi-scale data provides better support for the spatial inference of fine soil attribute information. In the future, we will carry out experiments in larger areas to further improve the efficiency of application, and plan to expand this study to consider three-dimensional soil property prediction.},

The RF responses of each of the nutrients with different concentrations in the range of 10MHz–4.4GHz are obtained using a signal generator and a spectrum analyzer. The results obtained show that at specific frequencies, the RF response of the soil nutrient under study changes in accordance with the changes in the concentration of the soil component and at other frequencies, it shows a flat response. Since the response varies in accordance with the concentration, these results can be used for the prediction of an unknown concentration of a nutrient using a multivariate analysis technique based on the PLSR model, where different concentrations of the nutrients are used as variables.},

Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing data and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit soil moisture information is important.},

	abstract = {Soil monitoring represents an essential aspect of agriculture nowadays. It is known, indeed, that soil parameters serve as important indicators of the growth of plants and field conditions, and their analysis is particularly useful to avoid waste of resources, such as water. In this paper, we propose a novel Sensing-without-Sensors System that has been specifically designed to measure the soil moisture without sensors but based on underground wireless transmission. As a matter of fact, radio waves propagation is affected by the soil moisture content; therefore, it is possible to estimate it based on the propagation characteristics. To do so, we exploit supervised machine learning algorithms that are able to derive the soil moisture starting from the Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) measured by End Devices (EDs) transmitting underground using LoRa modulation. The benefits provided by our system lie in the reduction of the cost with respect to standard monitoring solutions, which would require actual sensors deployed over radio transceiver, and in the possibility to estimate the soil moisture of a volume of the soil and not of a single point, as done by state-of-the-art systems.},

	doi = {10.1109/Agro-Geoinformatics.2016.7577690},
	abstract = {It has long been recognized that soil moisture is a significant parameter of climatological, hydrological and ecological systems. In energy exchange and matter exchange between land surface and atmosphere, soil moisture is also a key state variable. It is very important to monitor soil moisture in large range for hydrological and meteorological process and laws research, as well as for agriculture production. The monitoring methods of soil moisture include site observation on the ground and monitoring by remote sensing. The application of site observation is suitable for small range monitoring because it is labor-intensive and equipment-intensive. While, remote sensing has the positive aspects in monitoring surface soil moisture(within several centimeters) status in large range. However, the popular soil moisture data products from remote sensing are so rough in spatial resolution that it is more suitable for global scale rather than regional scale. Being affected by complicated factors, such as meteorology, topography, soil properties and vegetation, soil moisture is a highly variable parameter both temporally and spatially. From the view of regional scale research, it would lead much non-determinacy to relevant research, no matter using soil moisture data from ground-based observation constrained in small range or using those already existing data products from satellite observation rough in spatial resolution. For improving research reliability of regional scale, it demands observation data not only with high spatial resolution but also in large scale. Aiming at this issue, this paper adopting MODIS(moderate-resolution imaging spectrometer) data with middle resolution(1km) as data source, employing thermal inertia model as retrieval model, using Interactive Data Language(IDL) as platform, develops a system of soil moisture retrieval for regional scale research. This system provides functions including fast data preprocessing for massive remote sensing data, processing for measured data, soil moisture data retrieval as well as the rapid output of retrieval result. It would support the soil moisture fast retrieval in regional scale, make up the defects of rough resolution of existing soil moisture data production, realize the fast automatic processing for massive remote sensing data.},

Several studies utilized hyper-spectral and multi-spectral sensors to capture images and then extract needed information from pixels. However, these procedures are expensive and have low accuracy since they require extracting information from images indirectly rather than directly. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a point sensing system by utilizing a miniaturized spectrometer, which enables proximal sensing benefits for sensing surface soil moisture. We validated our point sensing system by conducting a series of real-world experiments and using the ordinary Kriging method for generating surface soil moisture distributions. Results demonstrated using a spectrometer can acquire spectrum response, and the spectrum absorption magnitude has been revealed at the specific band directly. Surface soil moisture and absorption magnitude have a significant correlation (R2≈ 0.92) for sensing surface soil moisture.},

The capacitive sensing technique is chosen due to its satisfying accuracy, low cost, and low complexity. Each probe measures the response frequency due to capacitance variation associated with the soil moisture. The response frequency is then transmitted wirelessly over the long range wide area network (LoRaWAN) to the network server. The mathematical model of the actual moisture content (MC) vs measured response frequency was developed. The model was optimized to achieve the optimal correlation R-square of 0.8996. The measured moisture contents are validated by the actual ones. It is found that the average error is only ±2.87\%MC. The web application is finally developed to display soil moisture contents.},

In the current scenario, the manual method of measuring the soil nutrients is less accurate because of the time difference of soil sample collected at the field and when it is measured in a laboratory.

Soil nutrient analysis using wireless sensor networks (WSN) enables various application like remote monitoring of soil fertility, analysis, provide a selection of crop and build irrigation decision support systems. In the proposed system, the wireless sensors measure the macro nutrient of soil and transmit the data to the cloud. The user can view the soil fertility at the convenience on their mobile application. It is possible that the farmer may wish to grow a specific crop based on the economic interest. The software system has the intelligence to recommend the fertiliser that is required to be used to suit the needs of the desired crop, thus improving the quality of the soil and in turn, increase the yield.

Multi-layered artificial neural network with the aid of MATLAB was used in the development of the prediction model.

The network was then programmed and integrated in the system in the actual setup. The model is validated by running trials with certain inputs and predicted flood level as the output and is compared to the actual flood level after a certain period of time. The flood prediction system showed an RMSD value of 2.2648 which signifies a small overall difference between the predicted flood level and actual flood level across the whole dataset tested in the actual setup.},

For better utilizing and reusing the agricultural information and knowledge, US Departments of Agriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) monitors US crop soil moisture condition using weekly field observations for counties in 45 states. The traditional State-level soil moisture is measured based on subjective and qualitative field observations through the crop progress report. These kind of observations are high-cost, not always precise, sometimes even inconsistent, unreliable, and do not provide complete national scale geospatial coverage. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission measures passive land surface microwave emission and active radar backscatter, it provides a reliable data source for cropland soil moisture assessment. Geospatial Web service enables users to leverage distributed geospatial data and computing resources from the third-party geospatial applications through the network, and to automate geospatial data integration and analysis. Comparing to the portal manner, geospatial Web service is a more efficient and more flexible manner to make multi-machine interactions possible. Standard-based geospatial Web services technologies have been widely adopted in accessing, managing, and analyzing data and information for agriculture and environmental monitoring. Building the geospatial web service for agriculture soil moisture could enable the interoperation among different agricultural applications and systems, as well as fulfill the requirements from different organizations and agencies.

	abstract = {In agricultural irrigation, soil moisture is a key parameter that affects crop growth and development. Therefore, obtaining soil moisture information to develop artificial intervention and regulation measures is an important guarantee for stable production and a prerequisite for achieving intelligent irrigation. Adopting the most advanced technology for precision irrigation is an inevitable trend in the development of modern agriculture. However, when accurately predicting the soil moisture in the monitored area, there is a dilemma: a small number of fixed detection points for soil moisture cannot effectively reflect the soil moisture information in the crop area, and the large number of sensor detection points makes investment costs high. This article proposes a Fuzzy-PID adaptive soil moisture monitoring system that combines fuzzy control and PID control. By collecting real-time soil moisture, based on the principle of fuzzy control, on the one hand, the soil moisture is adaptively adjusted according to the growth characteristics of plants to keep crops “not hungry but full”, and on the other hand, timely and appropriate irrigation is carried out to avoid waste of water resources while meeting the irrigation needs of greenhouses. The experimental results show that the system has accurate and reliable measurement data, good real-time performance, strong anti-interference ability, and can accurately and high-precision measure soil moisture.},

Typically, the quantity to be measured changes either the geometric properties of the structure used as a capacitive sensor or the physical properties of the dielectric between the electrodes of that structure. On the other hand, if the sensor geometry maximizes the capacitance due to fringing, then the possibilities are totally different. In this case, the electric field can be projected onto the test sample. This paper covers the usage of fringing field sensors to measure the water present in the soil. We examine how the geometry of the PCB-made interdigited electrode structure influences the characteristics of the sensor. However, fringing field sensors are difficult to be analytically modeled due to its intrinsic nonlinear characteristic. Therefore, our conclusions were mainly based on results of simulations, but we also tried to reproduce the results of the simulations experimentally. Also, we discuss a circuit that converts the changes in the sensor's capacitance into variations in the width of a pulse signal. Finally, the proposed solution has been experimentally compared with the standard gravimetric method to quantify the water content in the soil. The results were encouraging since the proposed sensor's measurements fit to the experimental data with a coefficient of determination R2= 0.94.},

In order to optimize the design with respect to sampling volume and losses, we derived the electromagnetic fields produced by a TDR sensor with this geometry. Using this analytical derivation, the effects on sampling area, waveform shape, and losses while varying design and soil water content were examined. It was found that when the soil and tube substrate have identical dielectrics, then sampling area has a local extremum. Tube radius has the largest impact of any geometrical parameter on sampling area with increases in radius causing increases in sampling area. Increasing electrode separation angle increases the sampling area slightly. The effects on TDR waveform are greatest for soil water content, tube dielectric, and tube radius: where increasing any of these increase delay and dispersion.},

The calibration models of the pulse acoustic velocity, the attenuation coefficient, and the double acoustic parameters with the soil volumetric water content (SVWC) were established through fitting analysis. We studied the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration models and conducted an extensive field experiment for 40 days to evaluate the calibration model's ability to predict SVWC. The results showed that the repeatability and reproducibility of the SVWC calibration model based on pulse acoustic velocity were the best, which showed that the acoustic velocity was more suitable for the inversion of SVWC than the acoustic attenuation coefficient.

As agriculture is given higher priority in the life of an economy so for the better agricultural growth, water is essential factor. Lack of enough water and excess of water leads to damage of plants. So we need an effective and efficient technology for better farming. Thus, the usage of a low cost arduino based automatic irrigation system using soil moisture sensor is expected to be useful to for the irrigation process in agriculture. This system requires an Arduino-UNO which contains ADC converter in it. A soil moisture sensor is the main component in this system which is used to measure the conditions of the soil like whether the soil is dry or wet. For displaying the conditions of the soil, 16×2 LCD display is the better choice to display and at last a motor is used to pump the water to the plant or crops.},

This condition can be optimized by adjusting water supply according to soil conditions. In this study, drip irrigation is controlled by a Proportional-Integral (PI) control system using information from soil moisture sensor as a feedback signal. This system uses pressurized water generator from direct water pumping driven by brushless DC (BLDC) motor. Combination of PI control, soil moisture sensor and BLDC motor driven pump makes this system more efficient in using water and electricity than conventional drip irrigation systems.

The moisture sensor is based on the principle that the phase shift in the transmission line is the function of medium dielectric constant, which is related to the moisture content. Compared with other methods like TDR and microstrip resonator, the phase shift detection method has better performance for these applications. Detailed sensor head design is based on the consideration of sensitivity, linearity, impedance match, dynamic range and power plane requirement. The solution is fully digital with integrated RF synthesizer, micro-controller, phase detection circuitry, baseband signal processing circuits, and digital communication protocol. The system calibration is built in the software program. The power management system reduces power consumption.

The first component is designed and implemented as a connected control hardware box to collect crop data. The second component is a soil moisture sensor used for field monitoring, connected to the control box. Its novel feature is the moisture sensor probe designed to connect directly to the ESP8266-12F microcontroller instead of using the TLC555 IC as a traditional sensor. The final ingredient is used primarily to control crop watering via a web application, which offers the user automatic or manual control. The automatic control function uses data from the soil moisture sensor to generate a watering schedule. Comparing the two sensors' soil moisture levels reveals approximately equal accuracy even during structural analysis and real experiments.

On the basis of soil moisture data, the suggested method determines the water requirement for crops. Varying crops require different levels of water regulation, as both insufficient and excessive water can be harmful to farming.

In this study, a new temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) to quantify surface soil moisture (SSM) is proposed.

The spatial pattern of TMDI has been analyzed over two time points of dry and rainy seasons for the plain area of Tainan, Taiwan, using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) image acquired on January 20 and October 19, 2014. The effectiveness of TMDI in reflecting the SSM status was then evaluated by the results of the simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and verified by the near-surface air temperature ( \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}text \{air\}\}\$ ) and humidity (RHair) measured by the ground-based weather stations. The results indicated that TMDI exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the simulated ET and positive correlation with in situ measured  \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}text \{air\}\}\$  from seven stations ( \$r = - 0.95\$  and −0.9 for simulated ET and  \$r = 0.94\$  and 0.78 for  \$T\_\{{\textbackslash}text \{air\}\}\$  corresponding to January 20 and October 19, respectively). We further compared the performance of the TMDI with the existing remotely sensed dryness assessment methods, including temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. The advantages of the TMDI in reflecting SSM, especially in the nonvegetation area, are clearly demonstrated. It is concluded that the TMDI is a reliable indicator for determining the SSM status with a large degree of freedom for further applications since it does not require any other ground-based measurements.},

A Monte-Carlo simulation is performed to assess the error budget of the soil moisture retrievals in the presence of radar measurement error and error in surface roughness. The estimated soil moisture retrieval accuracy is better than 0.06 cm3/cm3 for vegetation water content less than 1.2 kg/m2 and soil moisture in the range of 0 to 0.3 cm3/cm3. The retrieval performance improves if radar speckle is reduced by additional observations (e.g., including both fore- and aft-scan data). It is currently assumed that the surface roughness is known with 10\% error, but a time-series method is under development to estimate the roughness. The surface freeze/thaw state retrieval is simulated using a surface hydrology process model forced with climatology.

The research was undertaken for the National Airborne Field Experiment area located in the Murrumbidgee catchment, SE Australia. Validation of the temporal change detection analysis was undertaken using an airborne soil moisture product derived from the Polarimetric L-band Multibeam Radiometer (PLMR). The main propose of the PLMR use was to assess accuracy in terms of spatial patterns distribution. The results reveal expected temporal variability and adequate response of the active sensor to change in meteorological conditions. The presence of irrigation and standing water (rice fields) in the region challenges the spatial agreement throughout the study area.},

	abstract = {In this study, we will establish our new passive microwave soil moisture index (MSMI) based on data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) on the Aqua satellite. The theoretical basis of MSMI is the brightness temperature (TB) difference between the ascending across and descending across. To demonstrate the potential of the new microwave soil moisture index, we compared MSMI with the soil moisture (SM) product of NASA. The major purpose of this paper is to describe the concept and techniques involved in the newly developed MSMI and explore the general relationships between MSMI and soil moisture. In this first investigation, the information content of soil moisture and MSMI, was compared by examining its response in variations in the space-time domain. The results indicate that the MSMI can provide significant new information since the microwave measurements are sensitive to the soil moisture change between daytime and night. When soil moisture is higher, the MSMI is lower, when soil moisture content is lower, the MSMI is higher. MSMI will provide a new way in droughts monitoring and flood monitoring.},

	doi = {10.1109/IPSN.2012.6920949},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (soil moisture temporal evolution). In this paper we explore results from the compressive sensing (CS) literature and examine their applicability to this problem. Our main challenge lies in the selection of two matrices, the measurement matrix and a representation basis. The physical constraints of our problem make it highly nontrivial to select these matrices, so that the latter can sufficient sparsify the underlying signal while at the same time be sufficiently incoherent with the former, two common pre-conditions for CS techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution. We show that this basis attains very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints. Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data, and through comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that our approach is extremely effective in reconstructing the soil moisture process with high accuracy and low sampling rate.},

The harvest majorly depends on soil fertility, moisture level and also the level of fertilizers used. Time and distance are the major factors that limits farmers in performing the laboratory analysis of nutrients. Due to this inconvenience caused, nutrient testing is not performed regularly, which results the soil to lose its fertility. Using the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) a system is proposed which adopts precision agriculture in order to overcome such drawbacks and to remotely monitor the soil characteristics like soil moisture and its nutrients. Awareness about the quantity of nutrients present in the soil is essential to ensure optimum usage of fertilizers and constant monitoring of irrigation is also required for better productivity. The sensors are integrated with arduino microcontroller and the values obtained from the sensors are transmitted to the cloud and displayed in a mobile application. The proposed IoT based software system has the intelligence to measure the moisture level and quantity of the nutrients using colorimetry which improves the quality of the soil and ensures optimum growth of the crop.},

One scalable random placement algorithm with higher incoherence with the sparse-representation basis is proposed and the classical CS recovery algorithm is immediately exploited to obtain entire field's soil moisture value. Further- more, the compressibility is significantly improved by discovering one relative stationary monotonic non-decreasing coarse-grained ordering of locations in terms of soil moisture over time. Our numerical experiments show that random placement algorithm applying relative stationary coarse-grained ordering to re-label all locations can lead to the estimation performance improvement, compared with that leveraging initial ordering and the output of well calculated sub- optimal permutation algorithm. We further empirically prove that the performance of field estimation using CS recovery algorithm is much more robust to the previous knowledge about the field and is very suitable for the sensing application without enough historical data.},

There are many nutrients present in the soil such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K) Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (mg) and Sulphur (S), etc. Farmers do not have sufficient knowledge and information about the nutrient present in the soil. Therefore, they apply a lot of fertilizers in the soil, which causes the unbalanced soil nutrition levels. Hence, the aim this work is to predict the available nutrients in the soil using various Machine Learning (ML) techniques. In this work, three macro nutrients namely NPK which are needed for healthy plant growth are focused. Classification algorithms were used for prediction of soil fertility. Among all of these algorithms, Random Forest give the highest accuracy of 84\%. With the results obtained, the model is deployed using web app for recommending fertilizer which is very helpful to the farmers.},

After a heat pulse with controlled energy is applied to a heater, it is possible to show that the maximum temperature rise ATM measured in the temperature sensing element can be related to the volumetric water content of the soil θv [m3 m-3]. The design and fabrication of a low-cost soil moisture multiprobe heat pulse sensor system using conventional printed circuit boards and surface-mount devices is presented. The proposed sensor is free of the needles' deflection problem present in conventional multiprobe sensors and is manufactured using conventional off-the-shelf electronic components. A precision lowpower electronic signal conditioning circuit, using an instrumentation switched-capacitor building block, was developed and successfully used in the prototype. Due to an energy-efficient topology for the sensor and a low-power signal conditioning circuit, the average current consumption of the system (with one measurement per day) is only 3 μA. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, a prototype of the sensor was tested in soils with volumetric humidity in the range from θv = 0.05 m3 m-3 to θv = 0.41 m3 m-3 and, with a very low heating energy pulse (3 J), showed a sensitivity, normalized by the total energy applied, Γ = 211 × 10-3 °C m3 m-3 J-1.

The fertility of soil is measured by the amount of macro and micronutrients, water, pH etc. Soil nutrients are depleted after every harvest and hence must be replenished. To maintain nutrient levels in the soil in case of deficiency, fertilizers are added to soil. Most of the farmers choose to approximate the amount of fertilizers and add them manually. However, addition of fertilizers in right amount is a matter of great importance as excess or insufficient addition can harm the plant life and reduce the yield. Use of modern trends and technology promises to provide a solution to the above problem. Though automated techniques for seeding, weeding, harvesting the crops etc. have been proposed and implemented, none of the techniques target at maintaining soil fertility. The proposed research aims at restoring the levels of Nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium in the soil by the measuring the amount of nutrients present. The presence of nutrients is determined by chemical processes and quantified using sensors. An automated system has been developed for the controlled addition of fertilizers in order to avoid excess/ deficient fertilizers in the soil.},

Data shows that in terms of leaf length and weight, Setup A produces on average, longer leaves and heavier yields, respectively. However, based on the t-test analysis, both the p-value for the average length of leaves and weight were greater than the significance level, indicating that there was no significant difference in the results when using Setup A compared to Setup B.

	abstract = {Food is the necessity of humans which is in great demand. Agriculture is the major domain and primary source of food. Soil is the main resource for agriculture where the essential nutrients required for plant growth is available. Agriculture has progressed over time with modern technologies and more equipment's have replaced ancient farming methods. There is a great need to manage the amount of fertilizer to be added for every crop. Without soil testing, it is very difficult to ensure the right application of fertilizers for the crop and get the optimum yield. Analyzing soil samples in a laboratory is a time-consuming process that entails numerous steps, such as gathering soil samples, preparing them for analysis, conducting chemical or physical analysis, interpreting the analysis results, and ultimately providing fertilizer recommendations for crops. In this work, soil nutrient prediction system is developed which predicts the Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium (NPK) values and recommends the crop to be cultivated. In this system, BORUTA regression model gives highest accuracy of 91\%. Python is used to develop this prediction and recommendation system.},

Lightweight optical and thermal sensors have been used widely on UAVs for a range of applications, and have been proposed by some as the best approach to map soil moisture at farm scales. However, passive microwave remote sensing has been widely acknowledged as the most accurate soil moisture mapping technology, and adopted by the soil moisture and ocean salinity and soil moisture active and passive satellite missions. Accordingly, it is postulated that this will also be the best technique for UAV-based near-surface soil moisture remote sensing, overcoming the spatial resolution limitation from low earth orbit altitude. Being so far limited by sensor availability, only a small number of studies have illustrated the potential of UAV-based near-surface soil moisture mapping using L-band microwave radiometers, and there has been no direct comparison with the thermal-optical alternative. To guide the design of future UAV-based soil moisture mapping systems, airborne optical, thermal infrared, and passive microwave observations collected from a scientific aircraft at low altitude over a center-pivot irrigation farm in Tasmania, Australia were used in this study to simulate UAV-based observations, and the performances of the thermal-optical and microwave techniques when compared at 75 m scale. The L-band microwave emission showed a superior sensitivity to near-surface soil moisture, and a higher and more consistent soil moisture retrieval accuracy than thermal-optical, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.05–0.06 m3/m3 and 0.05–0.09 m3/m3, respectively.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a pivotal hydrological variable that links the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. In this article, a new soil moisture (SM) index (SMI), which aims to capture the temporal variability of SM, irrespective of cloud cover and solar illumination, was developed by using the L-band SM active passive (SMAP) radiometer observations. The SMI was proposed on the basis of two key foundations: 1) vegetation and roughness have similar effects on “depolarization” of microwave emission, while SM enhances polarization differences and 2) vegetation and roughness generally impose positive effects on surface emissivity, while SM and emissivity are negatively correlated. Based on the two physical principles, it is possible to decouple the effects of SM and those of vegetation and surface roughness in a 2-D space independent of vegetation type and roughness condition. The proposed SMI was then validated by in situ measurements from five dense SM networks covering different vegetation and climatic conditions and also compared with SMAP passive and European space agency climate change initiative (ESA CCI) SM products at a coarse resolution of 36 km, and SMAP-enhanced passive and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR2) SM products at a medium resolution of 9 km. The results show that the new SMI is able to well reproduce the temporal dynamic of SM with a favorable averaged correlation coefficient value of 0.87 and 0.84 at 36 and 9 km, respectively, higher than that of SMAP passive (0.80), SMAP-enhanced passive (0.77), ESA CCI (0.69), and JAXA AMSR2 (0.53). After removing the systematic differences between satellite and site-specific SM data by using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching technique, the SMI can achieve an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.031 and 0.036 m3m−3 at 36 and 9 km during the validation period, respectively, lower than that of the satellite SM products. In addition to surface temperature, the SMI does not need any further information from other sensors [e.g., the optical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or leaf area index (LAI) data] to guarantee an all-weather monitoring. Therefore, it has great potential to estimate SM variability on a global scale.},

In order to design a soil moisture network for this task in the Great Lakes Basin (522 000 km2), the dual-entropy multiobjective optimization algorithm was used to maximize the information content and minimize the redundancy of information in a potential soil moisture monitoring network. Soil moisture retrieved from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission during the frost-free periods of 2010-2013 were filtered for data quality and then used in a multiobjective search to find Pareto optimum network designs based on the joint entropy and total correlation measures of information content and information redundancy, respectively. Differences in the information content of SMOS ascending and descending overpasses resulted in distinctly different network designs. Entropy from the SMOS ascending overpass was found to be spatially consistent, whereas descending overpass entropy had many peaks that coincided with areas of high subgrid heterogeneity. A combination of both ascending and descending overpasses produced network designs that incorporated aspects of information from each overpass. Initial networks were designed to include 15 monitoring sites, but the addition of network cost as an objective demonstrated that a network with similar information content could be achieved with fewer monitoring stations.},

	abstract = {This article presents a new soil moisture monitoring system (SMMS) for precision agriculture applications. The system consists of a metamaterial-inspired microwave sensor and an electronic backend. The sensor was built on a biodegradable dielectric substrate, emphasizing sustainability, and uses a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) coupled to a microstrip line for excitation. This resonator, being a planar artificial structure with metamaterial properties, exhibits composite left/right-handed propagation, thereby displaying sensitivity to the dielectric constant of the applied medium. Accordingly, the sensing mechanism involves establishing a correlation between the soil moisture content and the relative displacement of the sensor’s resonance frequency, which varies as the soil’s dielectric constant changes due to moisture variations. The backend is controlled by an ESP32 module, which fulfills the tasks of signal capture, processing the data, and delivering the corresponding soil moisture. The transmission of data occurs via Wi-Fi using the MQ telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. To ensure accuracy, the sensor was calibrated using a gravimetric-based method for sandy and clay soil types. A curve-fitting model was extracted, exhibiting remarkable precision ( \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} = \{0.997\}\$ ), enabling the system to detect moisture levels from 0\% to 20\% for both soil types. The overall relative error was found to be 3.6\% for sand and 8.3\% for clay. Finally, the results obtained from the evaluation of the system in typical sandy soil conditions are presented. The system demonstrated its effectiveness by continuously detecting moisture levels ranging from 5\% to 11\% over a duration of 33 h, thereby confirming its viability for practical implementation.},

The experimental data and retrieval analyses lend support to the use of P-band SoOp for the remote sensing of SM.

Current methods in passive and active microwave remote sensing at L-band (e.g. SMOS or SMAP) are limited to a sensing depth of less than 10 cm. Observing RZSM (water in the top meter of soil) will require lower frequencies (P-band), presenting significant difficulties for a spaceborne instrument, due to the required antenna size, the presence of radio-frequency interference (RFI), and competition for spectrum allocations (in the case of active radar). Bistatic radar using Signal of Opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital satellite transmitters) offers the possibility of remote sensing using powerful signals already occupying bands allocated for communications. This paper will present early results from the first airborne campaign to study P-band reflectometry for soil moisture, conducted in Oklahoma between October 17-26, 2016. A geosynchronous communication satellite, transmitting a 25 KHz data signal on a 260.375 MHz carrier was uses at the signal source. Preliminary assessment of the data showed high reflectivity over a lake and consistent results between subsequent overflights of the watershed. Recently, a tower experiment has started using a 20 MHz wide signal centered at 370 MHz. Linearly polarized measurements were made over bare soil between 25-May-2017 and 8-June-2017 observing a strong reflected signal.

A logic circuit follows the conditional circuit with its output signals used to activate a system of relays that control the power circuit of the motors used for water pumping. The speed of the motor is varied according to the level of the soil moisture content; the motor is OFF during maximum wet and is running with HIGH speed during dry soil conditions respectively. The duration of water pumping is controlled by a timer circuit where the timer can be designed according to the desired watering time. The different stages of the overall electronic system are simulated and tested using NI MULTISM simulation software. The technique is useful to save human-power, enhances crop or plant productivity, saves water and provides proper water management to ensure efficient and viable farming industry especially in those places that receive less rain or mostly dry areas.},

	abstract = {Currently, near-surface soil moisture at a global scale is being provided using National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's) Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and European Space Agency's (ESA's) Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites, both of which utilize L-band (1.4 GHz; 21 cm wavelength ) passive microwave remote sensing techniques. However, a fundamental limitation of this technology is that the water content can only be measured for approximately the top 5-cm layer of soil moisture, and only over low-to-moderate vegetation covered areas in order to meet the 0.04 m3/m3 target accuracy, limiting its applicability. Consequently, a longer wavelength radiometer is being explored as a potential solution for measuring soil moisture in a deeper surface layer of soil and under denser vegetation. It is expected that P-band ( wavelength of 40 cm and frequency of 750 MHz) could potentially provide soil moisture information for the top {\textasciitilde}10-cm layer of soil, being one-tenth to one-quarter of the wavelength. In addition, P-band is expected to have higher soil moisture retrieval accuracy due to its reduced sensitivity to vegetation water content and surface roughness. To demonstrate the potential of P-band passive microwave soil moisture remote sensing, a short-term airborne field experiment was conducted over a center pivot irrigated farm at Cressy in Tasmania, Australia, in January 2017. First results showing a comparison of airborne P-band brightness temperature observations against airborne L-band brightness temperature observations and ground soil moisture measurements are presented. The P-band brightness temperature was found to have a similar but stronger response to soil moisture compared to L-band.},

Bistatic radar using Signal of Opportunity (SoOp) (e.g. digital satellite transmitters) offers an alternative approach, through reutilizing powerful signals already occupying bands allocated for communications. Airborne experiments using 240-270 MHz sources were conducted in October 2016, followed by a campaign using 360-380 MHz from a fixed tower location in an agricultural research site during the 2017 growing season. A new campaign that will also include I-band (137 MHz) is presently being installed in advance of the 2018 season. This paper will summarize activities to support the reduction of data from these campaigns and development of soil moisture profile retrievals.},

Regarding the sensitivity to vegetation, it was observed that the measured LR coefficients have a moderate power variation due to the presence of woody vegetation.

Emphasis is placed on examining the sensitivity of the backscattering coefficient and the brightness temperature to soil moisture variations. The effects of the underlying surface roughness of the forest floor on these sensitivities are addressed. The backscattering coefficient from the forest is modeled using the distorted Born approximation. Using this method the backscatter response is decomposed into a direct or volume scattering component, an interaction component between the vegetation and the average surface, an interaction component between the vegetation and the surface fluctuations and finally direct backscatter from the surface attenuated by the vegetation. Peak's method is used to determine the brightness temperature. The models are validated using ground truth and remote sensing data taken during the Forest Ecosystem Dynamics (FED) experiment conducted near Rowland, Maine, USA in 1990. During this period, the AIRSAR synthetic aperture radar and the Push Broom Microwave Radiometer overflew the Rowland area collecting data.

P-band, which is a longer wavelength measurement, provides the potential to retrieve deeper soil moisture information and to do so more accurately due to reduced soil roughness and vegetation effects.

In this paper we report progress on development of a consistent model for combined active and passive microwave remote sensing of vegetated surfaces by using the same approach to obtain backscatter and emissivity. The active model DBA/NMM3D is extended to calculate bistatic scattering for each of the three scattering mechanisms: volume, double bounce and surface scattering. Then emissivity is obtained by integration of the bistatic scattering. An advantage of this combined active and passive model is that the same physical parameters of vegetation and soil surfaces are used in both the active model and the passive model. The β parameter that relates backscattering to emissivity is also derived for various vegetated surfaces.},

This phenomena greatly compromise with the quality of soil moisture measurements. The proposed research presents an algorithm that averts usage of theoretical and empirical backscattering models. The algorithm uses Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere-Transfer model for soil moisture estimation that is used to quantify the backscattering components of radar signals. The algorithm has simple and valid assumptions that convert the total radar backscattering equations for a particular temporal scale into a set of simple linear systems.

An Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to perform data assimilation and parameter adjustment. The result shows that using the optimized parameters, the performance of model predictions of 0-10 cm soil moisture was greatly improved compared with the surface soil moisture fields derived from remote sensing data.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important variable in the process of water and energy exchanges at the land surface. Passive microwave remote sensing techniques have great potential for its frequent coverage, low data rates, and simpler data processing, but with poor spatial resolution, which resulted in sub-pixel heterogeneity. To study the effect of spatial heterogeneity of soil parameters on the retrieval of soil moisture, HI and EI were defined as the description of parameter's sub-pixel heterogeneity and the error of soil moisture retrieval, respectively. This paper firstly simulated different sub-pixel heterogeneities of each parameter, which were used as the input of the radiative transfer (RT) model, and then compared the soil moisture results retrieved by taking heterogeneity into account with that neglected the heterogeneity, seeking the relationship between those parameters' heterogeneity and the error of soil moisture retrieval. Finally, the conclusion was validated by two exact field experiments based on a Truck-mounted Multifrequency Microwave Radiometer (TMMR). It can be concluded that the RT model has enough accuracy to this study. The simulation analysis and field experiment reveals that there's a good relationship between the heterogeneity index and error index. The EI increased with HI grow up. However, the absolute error resulted by the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture in bare soil is negligible.},

	abstract = {In this article, the frequency range, within which the dependence of reflectivity on soil moisture is invariant respect to changes in soils texture, dry bulk density and organic matter content, has been established. The analysis is based on dielectric measurements of 16 natural mineral nonsaline soils in the frequency range from 45-100 MHz to 2 GHz. The moisture of soils varied from air dry to the field capacity. The clay, silt and sand content in the soil samples are ranging from 0\% to 76\%, from 1\% to 93\%, and from 0 to 100\%, respectively. The dry bulk density and organic matter content in soil samples are ranging from 0.7 g/cm3 to 1.8g/cm3, and from 0.6\% to 69\%, respectively. As a result, it is shown, that the variations in texture, dry bulk density, and organic matter content of soils have the least effect in the frequency range from 125 MHz to 820 MHz (with minimum at a frequency of 350 MHz) on the dispersion of the dependence of refractive index on volumetric moisture. As an example, the case of smooth bare soil surface remote sensing at a frequency of 435 MHz is considered. It is shown that for the entire set of soils, a single calibration curve for conversion of reflectivity to volumetric soil moisture is sufficient to retrieve soil moisture with a root-mean square error of 2.1\% and a determination coefficient of 0.981. The established frequency range can be recommended for microwave remote sensing methods of soil moisture measurement, not depended on soils texture.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important variable that controls the partition of rainfall into infiltration and run-off. This plays an important role in the prediction of erosion, flood or drought. Passive microwave remote sensing data has great potential for providing estimates of soil moisture. This is mainly due to the minimal weather influence on passive microwave data and its ability to penetrate through clouds. The artificial neural network (ANN) is a method that tries simulates human intelligence by crudely imitating the way a human brain learns. This method has been especially useful for mapping non-linear and ill-posed problems. Soil moisture retrieval is an example of a non-linear problem. An explicit inverse of the physical process can be built using an ANN to map the passive microwave measurements into land surface parameters such as soil moisture. For this paper, the ANN method used to create the explicit inverse function is divided into (i.) single parameter retrieval of the soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements, and (ii.) multi-parameter retrieval of a number of land surface parameters, i.e. soil temperature, surface roughness, together with soil moisture value given the passive microwave measurements. This paper examines these methods in the context of retrieving surface soil moisture values given microwave radiometric data and discusses key issues that will need to be addressed to improve mapping performance and to produce operational systems.},

A recursive exponential filter using a time constant, T, is used to compute a profile soil water index from the surface observations. Through optimisation, a unique value for T of 6 days is found to result in a satisfactory correlation between observation and estimate for all stations. The surface soil moisture observed is also used to evaluate the normalized surface soil moisture estimates derived from coarse resolution (25 km) active microwave data of the ASCAT C-band. For 11 stations, significant correlation levels are found. The best correlation between a soil water index derived from ASCAT and the in-situ observations is obtained for a T of 14 days.},

This paper suggests using the Optical Trapezoid Model as the sole vegetation descriptor in the WCM, as well as the use of a specific configuration of parameters derived from a function of radar frequency, polarization, dielectric particle size, and orientation distribution. The proposed inversion scheme is applied on Sentinel-1 data along with the Landsat-8 images component. The proposed approach achieves higher SMC estimation accuracies compared to those produced by tested methods. Indeed, the designed approach achieved improvements in terms of accuracy as demonstrated by a decrease of Root Mean Square Error values in the order of 0.3\% and 0.55\% in the Blackwell farms and Sidi Rached study areas respectively.},

	abstract = {Microwave radiometry is emerging as an important tool for global remote sensing of near-surface soil moisture in the coming decade. In a modeling study, we find that hillslope-scale topography (tens of meters) influences predicted microwave brightness temperatures at significantly coarser scales (kilometers). Through the physics of microwave remote sensing, topography is understood to effect brightness temperature observations in two important ways: (1) modulating the spatial distribution of factors affecting emission like vegetation biomass, moisture, and surface and canopy temperatures, and (2) determining the incidence angle and polarization rotation the observing sensor makes with the local land surface. Local incidence and polarization rotation angles can be explicitly computed knowing local terrain slope and aspect and sky position of the sensor. In an analysis of two synthetic domains, predicted hillslope-scale brightness temperatures within a less rugged landscape that is presented here can vary from approximately 224 to 302 K in the horizontal polarization and from approximately 298 to 320 K in the vertical polarization. Impacts of hillslope-scale heterogeneity in factors effecting emission account for at most approximately 2 K in predicted watershed-scale brightness temperature, while impacts of hillslope-scale topography on observing geometry can account for up to 28 K in predicted watershed-scale brightness temperatures in a topographically rugged area.},

	abstract = {In this paper, the results of radiothermal remote sensing of moisture and temperature of thawed soil on a test site in the Taymyr Peninsula using full-polarimetric observations of brightness temperature at the frequency of 10.7 GHz are presented. The brightness temperature data were obtained from MTVZA-GYa radiometer on a board of Meteor-M No. 2 satellite with footprint area near the Norilsk city and Khatanga, the Russia Federation. The MTVZA-GYa data covered the period from January 1 to December 31, 2015. The method to retrieve the soil moisture and temperature was based on solving an inverse problem by minimizing the norm of the residuals between the observed and predicted values of the brightness temperature. The calculation of the brightness temperature was performed using a semi-empirical model of radio-thermal emission the parameters of which have been pre-calibrated at the test sites in the area of Norilsk and Khatanga, as well as using a soil dielectric model with high in organic matter. The dielectric model was especially designed based on laboratory measurements of the complex permittivity of the organic-rich soil samples, which were collected at the test site near Norilsk city. As a result, the values of the root-mean-square error between the retrieved and measured soil temperatures and soil moisture were not exceed 6.5o 0.06cm3/cm3, respectively for both test sites. These results indicate the perspectives of using the full-polarimetric observations of MTVZA-GYa radiometer on a board of Meteor-M No. 2 satellite in the X-band for the purpose of measuring the soil temperature and soil moisture in the Arctic region.},

Thermal time and crop progress reports from the USDA-NASS defined critical transition periods of crop growth and management decisions for the validation process. Contrary to calendar timelines like annual segments, these key events separate the year into five irregular segments. Measurements at the South Fork Core Validation Site from 2016 to 2020 show that the two passive microwave satellites are dry compared to in-situ observations, but the active satellite and reanalysis model products were almost always wetter. Overall, most products perform the best during the pre-planting and post-harvest segments when no crops are present and worst during the active management phase when crops are starting to grow.},

The electric field results show its distribution above the ground due to the moisture content variation, and the measurements results give the comparison between the proposed printed antenna and the helical LoRA antenna. It is shown that a difference of cca 13 dB between the dry and the highest moisture level (40 \%) can be achieved in simulations, whereas in measurements, where the signal strength difference is measured from 10 \% to 50 \%, the difference is cca 6-7 dB.

In the hybrid method, the multiple scattering within a single wheat plant is first captured using the T-matrix based on the full-wave solutions of HFSS. In the second step, the scatterings among different plants are considered using the Foldy-Lax equations of multiple scattering theory (MST). The transmission of microwaves through wheat field at the L-, S- and C-bands are calculated using the hybrid method. Results show that: (1) the transmission obtained from the full-wave simulations is much larger than those computed from the radiative transfer equations (RTE) model, (2) the hybrid method transmission has a weaker frequency dependence than those of the RTE, and (3) the attenuation caused by the vegetation layer would saturate with an increase in frequency.},

Statistical regression methods based on bi-polarization (horizontal and vertical) brightness temperatures (Tb) observations obtained from AMSR-E. The coefficients of these regression equations were calibrated using SMOS level 3 SSM maps (SMOSL3) as a reference. This calibration process was carried out over the June 2010-Sept. 2011 period, over which both SMOS and AMSR-E observations coincide. Based on these calibrated coefficients global SSM maps could be computed from the AMSR-E Tb observations over the whole 2003–2011 period. In this study, the SSM maps were successfully evaluated against the SMOSL3 SSM products over the period of calibration (Jun. 2010-Sept. 2011). Correlations (R) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were computed between the AMSR-E retrievals and the reference (SMOSL3) SSM products. The R (mostly {\textgreater} 0.75) and RMSE (mostly {\textless} 0.04 m3/m3) maps showed a good agreement between the retrieved and SMOSL3 SSM products particularly over Australia, central USA, central Asia, and the Sahel. In conclusion, the statistical regression method is capable of retrieving a coherent "SMOS-AMSR-E" SSM time series for the period 2003–2014.},

At C-band, because of the attenuation due to large optical thickness, the distorted Born approximation gives negligible values for the surface scattering term and double bounce term. Because of the smallness of these two terms, the distorted Born approximation gives results independent of soil moisture. Physically, because the albedo is significant such as between 0.5 and 0.9, the radiative energy does not dissipate with the optical thickness, but go through multiple scattering within the vegetation layer. In this paper, we use vector radiative transfer theory to study the multiple scattering effects. We also study the transmission of the incident wave For rough surface scattering at C-band, due to increasing incoherent bistatic scattering from rough surface and the attenuation of coherent reflection, rough surface boundary condition will be applied to consider all scattered energy in rough surface scattering and the radiative energy interaction with the vegetation layer.},

Uncertainties in remotely-sensed soil moisture estimates can be attributed to many factors, including errors in measured brightness temperatures and input parameters, deficiencies of the radiative transfer scheme and variability of surface conditions within a satellite footprint. The purpose of this study is to quantify the magnitude of scaling errors attributable to heterogeneity within a satellite footprint of soil and vegetation properties and to present a method to reduce these errors. We address this problem using simulated single-frequency, single-polarization passive L-band microwave observations for an agricultural region of the United States.},

It is important to obtain reliable soil moisture content data that being consistent in space and time for water resources management. Land surface process model and data assimilation are effective means to obtain reliable spatial and temporal continuous soil moisture content. However, the lack of real observations and dynamically updated surface parameters often greatly affect the accuracy of stimulated results of the land surface model. Based on high-resolution remote sensing data, we continuously invert vegetation coverage which is the crucial parameter of land surface process model during the study period, dynamically update it, and consider the remote sensing inversion of soil moisture content as the observation input, combined with the data assimilation algorithm to carry out model simulation and data assimilation research. We choose China's Hetao Irrigation District as the research area, use Noah LSM model and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) algorithm to build the data assimilation system, and set the land use parcels of the irrigation district as the research unit. Based on the Chinese Gaofen-1 and environmental disaster reduction satellites' remote sensing data, we retrieve the vegetation coverage fraction every ten days, and generate monthly vegetation coverage fraction data to update the Noah LSM model parameter. Meanwhile, we use the TVDI algorithm to invert the soil moisture content as the observation data in assimilation system and the simulation of the Noah LSM model. Model simulation and data assimilation experiments show that the remote sensing retrieval vegetation coverage fraction can improve the effectiveness of model simulation, which approaches to the true value, and also improves the data assimilation accuracy. The overall performance is better than that using the fixed state parameter.},

	abstract = {Agricultura1 production and ecohydrological processes are strongly influenced by soil moisture dynamics, which is an important hydrological variable. Black soils are known for their fertility, farming suitability, and ability to produce the most. Global black soil areas are mainly located in the Mississippi River Basin of the United States, the Dnieper River Basin of Ukraine, and the Northeast Plain of China. A significant difference in soil moisture can be found in the global black soil area. This is as a result of differences in climate, topography, and production conditions. We can respond to the food crisis triggered by worldwide climate change by understanding black land long-cycle spatio-temporal changes. Due to its all-day, all-weather capabilities and certain penetration properties, microwave remote sensing has become one of the most common methods to invert soil moisture over a large area. Surface water soil moisture parameters are closely related to microwave scattered radiation characteristics of the surface. Microwave signals are more sensitive to soil moisture and have significant advantages over other wavebands. Methods: Based on the VOD vegetation optical thickness data products, we analyzed the spatio-temporal distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the three major black soil regions in the world from 1990 to 2020. In this study, the Theil-Sen median trend analysis was combined with Mann-Kendall significance tests to examine soil moisture changes in a long-term regional series comprehensively. The trend change patterns of different blacklands and different months were investigated. In addition, we investigated the area and proportion of soil moisture that were relatively stable and highly variable. Using the Hurst index analysis, we discussed future trends in soil moisture changes and their influencing factors. Results: A significant difference existed in the spatial distribution of soil water content in the black soil region of Eurasia. Ukraine’s soil water content was generally low, while northern China and eastern Russia’s values were higher; Global soil moisture in black soil had not changed significantly in the long-term series, and the overall trend was decreasing, largely due to changes in the northeast; Ukraine had the most stable dynamic change of soil moisture, while the Northeast Plain had relatively strong volatility; There is a possibility that soil moisture will decrease in the future due to the overall trend change in Eurasia. There may be a trend reversal in the 82.9\% area in the future, especially in Northeast China, which may be dominated by a decreasing trend. In general, the soil moisture content was higher than black soil in other parts of the world, but in the savannah ecosystem, the soil moisture content was higher than in any other part of the world. Conclusion: We obtained an international spatial and temporal distribution dataset for soil moisture in major blackland areas during 1990-2020 that will help to assess agricultural policy and ensure food security in the future.},

The satellite will carry a multi-frequency microwave radiometer operating in the L-, C-, X-, Ku-, and Ka-bands. In addition to providing L-band continuity from other missions (e.g., SMOS, SMAP), the CIMR mission brings new soil moisture remote sensing opportunities due to its multi-frequency, multi-resolution, and high temporal revisit characteristics. This study outlines a preliminary version of a soil moisture retrieval approach designed within CIMR preparatory activities. It aims to provide two soil moisture products: the first is based on the inversion of L-band brightness temperature measurements at their native resolution ({\textless}60 km). The second product is based on the inversion of enhanced resolution L-band measurements ({\textless}15 km) achieved through sharpening the L-band with higher resolution C/X-band measurements. In both cases, the soil moisture retrieval is based on the inversion of the zeroth-order tau-omega radiative transfer model. We present current efforts of algorithm development and performance evaluation based on simulated CIMR L1B data. The results presented here showcase the potential of CIMR to provide soil moisture estimates not only at hydroclimatological scales ({\textless}60 km, from L-band) but also at hydrometeorological scales ({\textasciitilde}10 to 25 km, from L-band, sharpened with C/X bands), meeting the needs of a wide range of science and applications.},

	doi = {10.1109/PIERS.2016.7735036},
	abstract = {Combined active and passive microwave remote sensing of vegetated surfaces is of great interest and importance given the increasing number of active and passive satellite microwave missions and datasets available for studies in land surfaces for application in hydrology and terrestrial ecology [1]. For many years, passive microwave retrieval algorithms for satellite missions such as AMSR-E, SMOS, and SMAP have been based on the omega (ω)-tau (π)-h model [2, 3], which is derived from the zeroth order solution of radiative transfer equation. Since the zeroth order solution ignores the Phase matrixterm, it is only valid when the omega is small. Using the physical scattering model of branches and leaves, the calculated omega at L-band is in the range of 0.2 to 0.6 and is not small. Thus the small omega used in omega-tau-h model is an effective parameter rather than a physical parameter. In modeling the rough surface effects, the omega-tau-h model only includes the coherent wave specular reflection as represented by h [4] while ignoring the bistaic scattering. Thus the omega-tau-h model uses a small h such as 0.1. The physical h, as calculated by numerical solutions of Maxwell's equations in 3D simulations (NMM3D) [5], is much larger and can be as large as unity at L-band. Thus the omega-tau-h model uses effective small omega and effective small h both of which are much smaller than the physical calculated values. For active remote sensing, we previously used the distorted Born approximation [6] and NMM3D (NMM3D-DBA)where the coherent reflectivity and rough surface scattering are calculated by NMM3D [7]. The model was used to calculate the V V and HH backscatter at L-band for grass [8], wheat and canola fields. The active model has been validated with Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) data [9] and shown good soil moisture retrieval results from the radar data compared with the ground measurements [8]. The distorted Born approximation is valid because the optical thickness at L-band is small. The distorted Born approximation is consistent with the first order radiative transfer theory except it includes backscattering enhancement in the double-bounce term. In this paper, we study the active and passive microwave remote sensing using NMM3D-DBA for both active and passive where NMM3D for rough surface bistatic scattering is used. The active model NMM3D-DBA is extended to calculate bistatic scattering and an integration of the bistatic scattering over the hemispherical solid angle is used to calculate emissivity. Thus the active and passive microwave remote sensing models are founded on the same theoretical basis and use the same physical parameters such as crop density, plant height, stalk orientation, leave radius, surface roughness, and so on. The vegetation canopy is modeled as a layer of uniformly distributed dielectric cylinders and disks representing stalks and leaves, respectively [6]. The distorted Born approximation is derived from Foldy-Lax equation with first-order iteration using the half-space Green's function and T-matrix [10]. The attenuation through the vegetation layer is accounted for by the imaginary part of the effective propagation constant calculated using Foldy's approximation [10]. The total bistatic scattering is expressed as the sum of three scattering mechanisms: volume scattering, double bounce scattering and surface scattering. Data-cubes which are lookup tables with three axes: vegetation water content (VWC), root mean square (RMS) height of an isotropic surface and soil permittivity directly related to the soil moisture [8], are then generated for both active and passive. From the active and passive data-cubes, the β parameter describing the linear relation between brightness temperature and co-polarized backscatter [11] is also derived for various rough surface and vegetation conditions. The data-cubes are useful for retrievals of detailed soil and vegetation characteristics such as soil moisture [8]. The model results are validated by coincidental airborne Passive Active L-band Sensor (PALS) data and Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR) data taken during the SMAPVEX12 field campaign [9]. Time-series retrieval of the soil moisture [8] is also performed by inverting the data-cubes assuming that RMS height does not change over time whose results are then compared with the ground measurements.},

It combines the effects of vegetation and roughness as a single parameter and uses the microwave polarization difference index (MPDI) to eliminate the effects of surface temperature and obtain soil moisture through a nonlinear iterative procedure. The advantage of this algorithm is that it needs only one frequency brightness temperature observations, and requires no field observations of roughness, soil moisture or vegetation data sets during the whole retrieval process. Finally, the algorithm was tested with the 6.9 GHz dual-polarized brightness temperature data from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and compared with NASA official algorithm using in situ soil moisture from 20 stations in the Tibetan Plateau. The results show that the soil moisture retrieved by the algorithm is more consistent with ground measurements than the NASA soil moisture products.},

The algorithm uses single-frequency single-incident angle measurements, considering effect of vegetation index (VI), establishs the relationship between volumetric soil-moisture and copolarized radar backscatter at L-band. The experiment exploits fine-scale spatial(10m) remote sensing data set by ALOS-PALSAR and coarse-scale radiometer soil-moisture to produce a high-resolution optimal soil-moisture estimate at 30m in the Heihe River Basin A'Rou. Then the capability of the algorithm is demonstrated by using measured data at high-resolution. The results show an improvement in root-mean-square error of 0.055cm3/cm3 and R2 is 0.7855. It indicates that the algorithm can obtain high accuracy of soil moisture estimate, and it is suitable for plain with homogeneous surface roughness.},

Microwave remote sensing is an effective means of surface soil moisture measurement. Aiming at the influence of vegetation cover in the process of surface soil moisture inversion of winter wheat farmland by microwave remote sensing, a cooperative inversion method using multi-source remote sensing data is proposed in this paper. Thirty-three feature parameters are extracted from Radarsat-2 full polarization SAR data and Sentinel-2 optical data, and ten parameters with high correlation with soil moisture are selected to participate in soil moisture inversion by Pearson correlation analysis. Combined with the ground sampling data, four machine learning models, including Random Forest, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Radial Basis Function and Extreme Learning Machine, are used for quantitative inversion of soil moisture to reduce the impact of vegetation and improve the inversion accuracy. The experimental results show that the Random Forest model is the optimal. The average of determination coefficient is 0.63959, and the average of root mean square error is 0.0317 cm3 / cm3, which provides a reference for the inversion of soil moisture in farmland using multi-source remote sensing data.},

The field measurements at the soil profile showed a clear pattern of the water movement into the basin corresponding to the lower parts of the system (lagoons). The land use analysis obtained with the optical images indicated a strong change in the floodplain due to the construction of protect barriers around the Villahermosa city losing its hydrological capacity. This allows the identification of three main covers (soil, vegetation and air) that were monitored and feed to the model (MIMICS) in order to estimate iris using the Envisat image.

It is also the basic parameter of crop growing and crop yield forecast. With the features of observing large area synchronously, timely, and economically, remote sensing technique makes dynamic soil moisture monitoring possible. Soil moisture remote sensing monitoring has 30 years history and many researches have been done home and abroad in this field, including visible and infrared remote sensing based NDVI methods, hyper spectral remote sensing based algorithm, and microwave remote sensing orientated methodology and so on. Among these methods, microwave has great advantage in retrieval soil moisture because of the characteristics of all-weather, penetrability and not affected by the cloud. Through study people found that microwave is one of the most effective methods in retrieval soil moisture in various technologies. This paper summarizes the major microwave sensors and the principle of microwave remote sensing, and introduces the microwave model and soil moisture algorithm. Based on ENVISAT Radar data, with suburban farmland (wheat and corn as the main crop) of Peking as the study area, we established the microwave scattering characteristics database of local exposed surface. We used the selected model to simulate the response characteristics of backscattering coefficient influenced by a variety of parameters, such as soil moisture, surface roughness, incidence angle, polarization, etc. Then we got the updated inversion empirical model of the exposed surface, and evaluated the accuracy of model with the actually surveyed data in the field. This article makes certain contributions to the active microwave soil moisture retrieval methods study, and provide a viable model for water resources decision-making support to the Peking municipal government.},

Second, the scatterings among different plants are considered using the Foldy-Lax equations of multiple scattering theory (MST) and the extracted T-matrix. The transmission of microwaves through wheat field at the L-, S- and C-bands are calculated using the hybrid method. Results show that the full-wave based transmission is much larger than those obtained from the radiative transfer equations (RTE) model.

Simulation shows that apparent thermal inertia is not applicable under the condition of higher vegetation coverage (e.g. FVC {\textgreater} 0.65), while the soil evaporation efficiency has a higher correlation with soil moisture under dense vegetation coverage and is recommend to be used for downscaling of soil moisture.},

In this work, we have fabricated the graphene oxide (GO) based soil moisture sensor and considered the effect of the annealing on the soil moisture sensing properties. For this purpose, first, we have prepared the sensor where we have taken three derivatives of the GO viz. GO prepared at room temperature (250 C), GO annealed at 50o C, and 90o C. Further, these three forms of GO are drop casted on the IDEs fabricated on the silicon substrates and explored the sensor’s transfer function characteristics. Lab measurements results indicate that the fabricated sensors offer a response of about \${\textbackslash}approx\$384 \%, \${\textbackslash}approx\$306 \%, and\${\textbackslash}approx\$224 \%, when the gravimetric water content (GWC) is varied from 1.5 \% GWC to 23 \% GWC for the GO prepared at 25 0C, 50o C and 90 0C, respectively. Likewise, we also observed that GO prepared at 25 0C is highly selective to the GWC when compared with the GO prepared at 50 0C and 90 oC. Based on these experimental investigations we analyzed that the sensor response drops as the annealing temperature is increased. This is attributed to the diminishing oxygen functional groups when the temperature increases.},

	abstract = {Radar remote sensing of soil moisture content at low frequencies requires an accurate scattering model of realistic soils, which often involves multilayer rough surfaces and inhomogeneous dielectric profiles. In this paper, a hybrid analytical/numerical solution to two- dimensional scattering from multilayer rough surfaces separated by arbitrary dielectric profiles based on the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and scattering matrix technique is presented. The reflection and transmission matrices of a rough interface are constructed using EBCM. The inhomogeneous dielectric profile is modeled as a stack of piecewise homogeneous dielectric thin layers. The scattering matrices of an inhomogeneous dielectric profile are computed by recursively cascading reflection and transmission matrices of individual dielectric interfaces. The interactions between the rough interfaces and the inhomogeneous dielectric profile are accounted for by applying the generalized scattering matrix technique. The solution presented in this paper is for the two-dimensional scenario of multilayer rough surfaces. The technique can also be applied in three dimensions. In numerical simulations, the actual field-collected soil moisture data are used. In particular, the dielectric profiles during both dry and wet ground conditions are examined. The numerical simulations are performed to investigate both backscattering scattering coefficients and co- polarized phase difference due to different subsurface roughness parameters and ground conditions. The results show that both backscattering coefficients and co-polarized phase difference at low frequencies are sensitive to the roughness of subsurface interfaces and deep soil moisture. Also, much larger depth sensitivity can be achieved using co-polarized phase difference than scattering coefficients.},

	abstract = {The goal of the NASA SMAP L-band Active and Passive mission is to retrieve soil moisture with 4\% accuracy for vegetated surfaces that have vegetation water content (VWC) less than 5 kg/m2. The satellite was launched in January 2015. After the failure of the radar on July 7, 2015, there has been increasing interest in using the Sentinel C-band radar data for the active part of the mission. In using a physical model at L-band and C-band to treat the vegetation effects for such VWC, the common approaches were the distorted Born approximation [1] and the radiative transfer theory [2] under the single scattering approximation. However, the distorted Born approximation assumes small optical thickness which is not valid at C-band [3]. In treating the scattering from a collection of dielectric cylinders, the common approach is to use the independent scattering model by adding the scattering cross sections of cylinders. More advanced approaches include the coherent model [4, 5] which takes into account the phase difference among scatterers that are in close proximity of each other. To account for multiple scattering effects which are important when the optical thickness and scattering albedo of the vegetation layer are significant, we recently used an iterative approach of radiative transfer equation including backscattering enhancement for corn layer at L-band [6]. In this paper, we study two kinds of multiple scattering. One is continuing iterative radiative transfer with backscattering enhancement for various crop types at C-band. Using the iterative approach, the contribution to backscattering from each scattering mechanism is separated and thus the cyclical terms are also identified by examining the duality of the paths for each scattering mechanism. The second multiple scattering effects are more appropriately called near field wave interactions. For this case we consider cylinders in close proximity, and we solve Maxwell equations numerically. The near field interactions cause the internal field to be different from the independent scattering. The full wave solutions go beyond the coherent approach which only considers phase factor without accounting for the change of internal field. Numerical results of these multiple scattering models are illustrated and compared with the prior approaches of distorted Born approximation, independent scattering and coherent model. After taking into account the near field interaction between scatterers, the resulted absorption coefficient are different from the single scattering model, because the original internal field induced by the incident field alone is affected by the scattered field from the other scatters. The scattering pattern is also different from that of the coherent model [5]. In the coherent model which is the coherent addition of the scattering field from each scatterer, the effects of the scattered field from the other scatterers are ignored when calculating the scattering field from a scatterer. Thus the internal field of each cylinder calculated in the coherent model is inaccurate when the cylinders are in clusters.},

ET limits drainage of water through the cell cover profile, while soil structure and drying by plants can increase radon diffusion; therefore, soil water content is a key performance parameter. This study used theoretical simulations to analyze the sensitivity of multi-frequency radar backscatter to soil moisture (SM) at different depths of an in-service DOE LM disposal cell. A machine-learning approach was then developed using Google Earth Engine to integrate multi-source observations and estimate SM across six soil layers from depths of 0-2 m. The model predictors included backscatter observations from satellite Synthetic Aperture Radar, vegetation and temperature products from optical-infrared sensors, and accumulated rainfall data from Daymet. The model was trained using in-situ SM measurements from 2019 and validated using data from 2014-2018 and 2020-2021. The approach produced accurate SM estimates for the six soil layers (R-values from 0.75 to 0.94; RMSE from 0.003 to 0.017 cm3/cm3; bias {\textasciitilde}0.00 cm3/cm3). Additionally, the approach captured seasonal SM variability and spatial heterogeneity at 30-m resolution. The machine-learning based multi-source data fusion approach may characterize soil moisture dynamics at DOE LM disposal sites better than in situ measurements alone.},

In order to improve the model scheme more close to the practical processes and integrate with more remote sensing data, an exponential equation replace original linear function to divide surface and sub-surface flow, moreover, leaf area index based canopy interception model and Shuttleworth-Wallace evapotranspiration model are incorporated into the model structure. The results show that the improved model gained a good performance for runoff simulation; Soil moisture simulation is also perfect and the spatial distribution has a tight relationship with the land cover and soil type. The temporal variations of simulated water content over the whole catchment almost have the same tendency with measured soil moisture content at Meishan station. So, the water content of the infiltration reservoir can indeed stand for the index of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {As soil moisture prediction model with the whole near-infrared spectral regions is complex and the single-band prediction model is susceptible to environmental impact, a dual-band method for measuring soil moisture content (MC) rapidly was proposed in this study. A total of 116 soil samples were collected and the NIR reflectance spectra of all soil samples were measured. The spectral data were transformed to new spectral data with logarithmic transformation and logarithmic of reciprocal transformation. The spectral bands of the new spectral data and the original spectral data that is sensitive and insensitive to soil moisture content were achieved by correlation coefficient method. The models for prediction of soil MC were developed based on single linear regression (SLR) with the sensitive spectral band and insensitive spectral band. The results show that the prediction precision of the models was high and the highest correlation coefficient of the models reached 0.9913 with the root mean square error of prediction RMSEP of 1.1983\%. Thus, it is concluded that the methods used in this paper are available methods for rapid detection of soil MC and also provides theoretical basis for developing a low-cost portable near-infrared moisture meter.},

Two ground-based GNSS-R experiments were conducted recently in Beijing. This paper proposes a statistical model based on least squares histogram fitting to process the acquired data. Although either the model error or the mismatching of the measuring depth could lead to the discrepancy between the estimated and in situ soil moisture, this approach can isolate the estimated values from different parts of the mixed surface and estimate soil moisture of a homogeneous surface more reasonably than the simply averaging method.},

A newly developed, iterative, generalized, hybrid decomposition and inversion approach is applied for a flexible soil moisture estimation under a temporally and spatially varying agricultural vegetation. Therefore an iteration-adaptive, generalized scattering model of the vegetation is used. First results of the inverted soil moisture under vegetation cover reveal high inversion rates for the agricultural test sites ({\textgreater}95\%). The inverted soil moistures are validated with in situ measurements from simultaneously conducted field campaigns leading to a minimum root mean squarer error (RMSE) of 4.1vol.\% for a variety of crop types and in situ moisture conditions (ranging from 5vol.\% to 40vol.\%).},

	abstract = {A soil moisture (SM) retrieval algorithm, rooted in electromagnetic theory, is proposed and validated against synthetic data with good retrieval accuracy. The proposed Sliced Regression (SR) algorithm generates piece-wise linear fits to a data set obtained from a forward model, and then retrieves the soil moisture by applying a linear least-squares approach. This algorithm is compared against a widely employed semi-empirical inversion algorithm (SMART), and it is observed that better results are returned from the former. Performance of the proposed retrieval algorithm on single band and dual band (L and S-bands) retrieval is studied; and it is found dual band retrieval returns better retrieval results for SM, along with other soil surface parameters. The proposed algorithm is employed on synthetically generated data-sets (generated using the Integral Equation Method as the forward model for ground scattering) for SM retrieval scenario considering all the primary influencers on backscatter into the model. To measure SM for vegetated terrain, vegetation is modelled as a collection of randomly oriented dielectric cylinders with radii and length specific to the vegetation. The overall backscatter is calculated as the sum of individual contributions from the ground, vegetation and their interactions. Having parameterized the vegetation forward model as above, we extend the SR to retrieve SM in the presence of vegetation.},

The soil moisture at different depths of a soil layer and time lag on usefulness of the MPDI for estimating soil moisture content was analyzed; the effectiveness of the MPDI was evaluated with the observed soil moisture content and the comprehensive drought index K for different soil types. The results showed that the MPDI was significantly correlated with soil moisture content for the top soil layer with 10 cm depth. For a time lag ranging from 0 to 4 days, the correlation of MPDI to soil moisture was significant with no time lag in the depth of top 10 cm (r = -0.867). For the stations of the same soil texture type of loam, the correlation coefficient between MPDI and soil moisture is higher than that of all soil texture types. In a regional scale, the MPDI reflected an obvious spatial pattern of drought under different growing stages in the drought years over the study area.},

	doi = {10.1109/AMTA.2008.4763147},
	abstract = {The science of microwaves owes its origin to the development of radar. Microwaves are part of electromagnetic spectrum. This field became vitally important as man reached out to space. Frequency range of these waves are from 3 GHz to 30 GHz. Microwaves have unique capabilities in remote sensing. The field of microwaves remote sensing has come to a stage of rapid growth. Microwaves can penetrate clouds and so the sensors can operate in all weather conditions. They are sensitive to the presence of moisture in the soil as well as in vegetation or any another material which absorbs moisture. Microwave sensors are of two types: active sensors and passive sensors. Passive sensors have been used for soil studies for the determination of moisture content, oceanographic application to determine winds over the ocean surface and water vapor content in atmosphere as well as liquid water content in clouds. Soils are composed of solids, liquids and gases mix in variable proportions. Soil texture depends upon the size of the particle and structure of soil depends on the way particles are arranged. Soil has physical as well as electrical properties. Colour, texture, grain soil etc. comprised the physical properties where the electrical properties include dielectric constant, conductivity and permeability. Dielectric constant is the primary electrical property which is used to estimate emissivity and brightness temperature of soil. Emissivity is an important parameter for microwave remote sensing, which provides information about soils. All substances at a finite absolute temperature radiate electromagnetic energy. Emissivity is the ratio of energy emitted by object to black body maintained at same physical temperature. Emissivity is a function of physical and electrical parameters of the object and electrical parameter of sensors. These are the moisture content in the object surface type (smooth or rough), dielectric constant (e), angle of incidence, polarization. Emissivity can be obtained from the measured dielectric constant (e) using the available models. The emissivity can be measured by instrument radiometer, which is highly sensitive receiver. Radiometers are passive microwave sensor, which collects the incoming radiations, amplify as well as process the signal, and gives the output, which is linearly related to incoming radiation collected by antenna. The electromagnetic radiations are measured by passive remote sensor in the form of brightness temperature. The radiometer system used here consists of LNBC, receiver and power meter. The LNBC (low noise block down converter) converts the signal to a lower frequency and sends them out to the cable connector, which is connected to satellite receiver via co-axial cable. LNBC have input frequency range 10.75 to 12.75 GHz and noise temperature of 35 degK. The receiver output is connected to microwave power meter. The power monitored is related to incoming EM radiations. The radiometer is calibrated using liquid nitrogen and sky as the targets. Then the EM radiations emitted by dry and wet soil are measured at different look angles (10deg to 60deg) with step of 5deg. The measured power is converted into brightness temperature and the brightness temperature is co-related to soil moisture. In the paper the relation between soil moisture and brightness, temperature is presented. This provides input for determination of soil moisture using passive sensors.},

This paper presents an experiment-based electrical modeling of white clay soil, applicable for frequency range of 40Hz to 1.26MHz, which can be used to represent the same soil in any soil moisture circuit and system design. This model is then used to design an LC oscillator for soil moisture measurement.

IDE on Si wafer is mounted on the printed circuit board (PCB) and electrical contacts are taken out. During the lab measurements, we observed changes of 153 pF to 400 pF for different soil moisture ranges of 7\% to 55\% respectively in the black clayey soil. The response time for the fabricated microsensors is around 120 seconds in the soil for all types of measurements. Further, the change in response of the sensor is 16\% when the temperature varies from 25 °C to 50 °C.

India is one of the 13th countries in the world having scarcity of water resources. Due to ever increasing of world population, we are facing difficulties in the shortage of water resources, limited availability of land, difficult to manage the costs while meeting the demands of increasing consumption needs of a global population that is expected to grow by 70\% by the year 2050. The influence of population growth on agriculture leads to a miserable impact on the farmers livelihood. To overcome the problems we design a low cost system for monitoring the agriculture farm which continuously measure the level of soil moisture of the plants and alert the farmers if the moisture content of particular plants is low via sms or an email. This system uses an esp8266 microcontroller and a moisture sensor using Losant platform. Losant is a simple and most powerful IoT cloud platform for the development of coming generation. It offers the real time data visualization of sensors data which can be operate from any part of the world irrespective of the position of field.},

In this paper, the SMAP simulated data product time series, such as L2\_SM\_A, L3\_SM\_A/P, L4\_SM, L1C-S0\_HiRes are first evaluated for their suitability for NASS operational cropland soil moisture monitoring by comparing SMAP results with the NASS' survey based weekly soil moisture observation data for their consistency and robustness. The preliminary results illustrate that SMAP products have the potential for NASS operational use at least for county level soil moisture statistics.

The detector is composed of an ultrasonic transducer and a metallic pipe whose lower end is inserted vertically into the ground. An ultrasonic wave generated by the transducer at the upper end of the pipe travels through the pipe to the ground, and is reflected at the soil's surface inside the pipe. The soil's moisture and groundwater level are monitored by using the intensity and propagation time of the reflected ultrasonic wave. The intensity depends on the temperature of the detector and the propagation time depends on the air in the pipe, and we developed methods of calibrating these. The intensity of the reflected wave in the indoor experiments increased with the soil's water content and changed dramatically depending on whether the soil was fully dry, wet, or saturated. The propagation time decreased with rising groundwater levels. This method has the main advantage that both the soil's moisture and water levels can be monitored with one detector.},

	abstract = {The growing population causes increasing clean water demand. This leads to a crisis of water demand due to high water consumption. During the dry season, water availability becomes increasingly rare for crop needs. To obtain maximum crop production, the availability of water should be sufficient. Therefore, an application for Android was created to assist monitoring of soil moisture. This application obtains data from the sensor which is connected to Raspberry Pi 3. This data will be sent to the server and displayed on Android application. LED indicator is provided to notify the water supply for the plants. The final result of this research is a system application development where a sensor with analog data can be converted into percentages and displayed in the Android application. From this percentage, users can set the indicator for the sensor to turn on the LED. Users can also view graphs from percentage data, manage plant data for the database, and set the application configuration.},

The most widespread approach is based on the synergy between radar and optical data to retrieve soil moisture. The aim is to study the potential of Sentinel sensors (Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2)) for the retrieving of the soil moisture at regional scale. First, an analysis between the radar (S-1) and the measured data (soil moisture, soil roughness and Leaf Area Index (LAI)) is established over bare soils and cereal fields in the Kairouan plain, Tunisia. The results of the sensitivity analysis show that the radar signal in VV (vertical) polarization and soil and vegetation parameters are strongly correlated than in VH cross-polarization. The Water Cloud Model was calibrated using the NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) retrieved from Sentinel-2 images. Then, an inversion approach of this model is developed for the mapping of soil moisture at high spatial resolution.},

	abstract = {Drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) used for agriculture have recently emerged as a key tool for ground sensing in "smart farming." For precision agriculture's water management and monitoring and control systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are used as a mobile hotspot in areas without a dependable internet connection. In such places, the agricultural UAV equipped with a suite of Internet of Things sensors would be rendered ineffective. Currently, IoT sensors collect data on the soil's temperature and moisture and transmit that information to farmers through cloud storage and mobile apps rather than UAVs. In this proposed work, we have combined and connected UAVs and IoT network-based sensors. We have proposed a system to collect and measure the soil moisture contents remotely in real-time through a drone. For a country like India whose main source of revenue is agriculture, this domain is not sufficiently explored in terms of technology. The lack of sufficient research in this domain has been a problem for the livelihood of those farmers whose sole existence depends on agriculture. An economical process could be devised that could help automate the process of knowing the exact soil moisture content of the entire farmland. Farmers would benefit greatly from such a process. In this proposed work, we monitor real-time soil moisture by collecting the data using the soil moisture sensor and an Arduino UNO. The transmitted data is transmitted to the drone, which further sends the resultant data for real-time monitoring and analysis to the cloud.},

The yield differences with observation were decreased by 379 kg/ha for LAI assimilation, 592 kg/ha for SM assimilation and 866 kg/ha for LAI+SM assimilation. Assimilating LAI and SM jointly received best performances in soil moisture and yield estimation.

Two retrieval approaches based on Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) have been applied to these areas. Looking at the preliminary results, it has been noted that the integration of X and C band images could provide valuable information for the retrieval of SMC, even though further investigations should be carried out on a larger time-series and set of samples. On the South Tyrol test area, SVR methods provided an accuracy in the estimate of SMC with determination coefficient, R2{\textgreater} 0.85 and root mean square error, RMSE {\textless};4\%. By using X band alone, the result obtained is worse: ANN algorithm resulted in R2 from 0.35 to 0.8 and RMSE= from 6 to 2 (\% SMC), depending on the polarization combinations considered as input.

The PRVI was determined at different frequencies ranging from the 37 GHz to the 6.9 GHz. The index was tested during extreme flooding events in Asia and Europe as well as in Northern America. The index was implemented globally using observation from passive microwave instruments. The analysis of the results on global scale shows that the index was sensitive to extreme hydrological event and that false alarms were mostly issued over northern snow covered regions only. This implies that the proposed index can be used to assess and delineate flooding conditions.},

Therefore, this paper proposes to use machine learning based high-resolution soil moisture (ML-HRSM) data for field level drought and irrigation monitoring. The preliminary study results show that the ML-HRSM data can accurately delineate field-level soil moisture variations at high spatial (30-m) and temporal (daily) resolutions. It can accurately capture field level soil moisture changes caused by the irrigation activities and vegetation ET processes. The irrigation activities are indirectly confirmed by weekly MODIS NDVI maps. The preliminary results indicate that the surface ML-HRSM is capable for irrigation activity and drought monitoring at field level.},

Focused on the problem that antenna irradiated region may not meet the minimum radar resolution pixel, the research applied the multiple independent samples measuring method and analyzed the relevance between soil moisture and backscattering coefficient of S-band VV polarization. The inversion equation obtained was applied to inverse soil moisture from SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) S-band images of HJ-1C (a satellite designed for environment and disaster monitoring). The inversion results were verified by the multiple independent samples data measured and agreed well with the experimental data, which shows the S-band VV polarization data can be used to monitor the soil moisture in a large scale.},

	abstract = {In the dry tropical forest and semi-arid savanna information about the soil moisture dynamics and distribution are vital to better understand and mitigate damages caused by drought. To estimate the soil moisture over large areas from 50-m resolution ALOS-2 ScanSAR data, we adopt dual-polarization L-band algorithms originally developed for high resolution ALOS data. Based on the partial-polarimetric eigenvector decomposition, the scattering entropy and alpha angles are employed to correct for the above ground vegetation effects. The large incidence angle variation along the 350-km ScanSAR swath requires the use of an incidence angle correction factor. However, due to the relative poor data quality of the ScanSAR products suffering from scalloping and near-range/far-range striping along the subswathes, we observe lower accuracies than Stripmap mode. While in the dry season soil moisture retrieval in the open forest is well possible, in the rainy season the entropy exceeds the validity range due to the larger amounts of canopy biomass resulting in unreliable soil moisture estimates. Savanna vegetation allows a biomass-corrected soil moisture estimation throughout the whole year. Due to the lack of distributed in-situ data, we use coarse scale SMOS and SMAP soil moisture data to validate the accuracy of dual-polarization ScanSAR soil moisture estimates. Comparisons between the kilometer-scale radiometer derived soil moisture estimates and 50-m ALOS-2 results show a good agreement in the dry season with RMSEs smaller 5 Vol.-\%, while in the rainy season the RMSEs can be as high as 15 Vol.-\%.},

As many Copernicus services will benefit from using the resulting dual-frequency (C- and L-band) SAR data in a synergistic manner, the question arises which orbit configuration serves the Copernicus services best? The first option is to fly ROSE-L in convoy with Sentinel-1 – and later with Sentinel-1NG – to acquire matching dual-frequency SAR imagery just a few minutes apart. The second option is phase the satellites orbits such as to maximise the daily global coverage achieved by all satellites. This contribution is intended to highlight that the second option is clearly preferred by the Copernicus Global Land Monitoring Service and the Copernicus Emergency Management Service that provide amongst other data products near-real-time soil moisture and flood monitoring data serving a broad range of applications (from emergency response to data assimilation). The availability of daily SAR images at either C- or L-band will ensure that also smaller, rapid flood events and highly dynamic soil moisture processes are captured. Furthermore, the availability of L-band data interleaved with the C-band data stacks can be expected to improve the retrievals significantly. These advantages outweigh the modest improvements in retrieval accuracy that can be expected for soil moisture and flood retrieval by reducing the time difference between C- and L-band acquisitions by flying the satellites in convoy.},

While there exist several in-situ soil moisture networks across the globe, there is an absence of a large-scale network for the Indus Basin. This paper summarizes our five years of work in the Indus basin to establish a soil moisture monitoring network, WITSMS-Network with more than 200 installations, primarily to empower farmers for real-time irrigation scheduling. The sensors were calibrated using the gravimetric method with a R2 value of 0.9388 and RMSE of 0.025 m3m−3 for WIT’s indigenously developed WZ-1 soil moisture probe. Both WZ-1 and commercially available soil moisture probes were integrated into an IoT hardware-software backbone for real-time data transmission, storage and sharing over the Internet. We also offer an approach to validate the soil moisture network, based on TCA metrics, against coarse resolution satellite and model-based soil moisture products including SMAP-L2, C3S SM combined, ESA CCI SM combined, and ECMWF ERA5-Land model. Our network achieved an ubRMSD 0.0460 m3m−3 over 2 years of soil data records. These reproducible validation results have been generated using a community-wide accepted QA4SM validation framework. The soil moisture data is being published at ISMN under WIT-Network1.},

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, such as Sentinel-1, has shown potential for estimating soil moisture at high spatio-temporal resolutions. However, the sensitivity of SAR responses to soil moisture and the applicability of Sentinel-1 data for soil moisture estimation at different land covers require further investigation. In this paper, we evaluate the sensitivity of Sentinel-1 data for soil moisture estimation and compare the estimated soil moisture for different land covers. A change detection approach combined with a vegetation scattering model is employed to estimate soil moisture. The results demonstrate that while the change detection approach with vegetation correction improves soil moisture estimation, the accuracy is still not within an acceptable range for plot-level decision-making, such as irrigation management. However, the results show that the soil moisture information obtained from Sentinel-1 data can be suitable for regional-level monitoring applications and decision-making.},

As more and more satellite sensors are launched in recent years, a number of satellite soil moisture products are operationally produced with different spatial and temporal coverage and quality. However, the application of these products is usually limited by their spatial resolutions that is determined by their native sensor footprint sizes, which are usually tens of kilometers. To broaden the range of satellite soil moisture applications, products with finer resolution are in great need. This paper explores a soil moisture downscaling algorithm and its potential for drought monitoring at local scales. Downscaled soil moisture product is compared with soil moisture products produced from airborne measurements. The results show that the quality of the downscaled soil moisture product is comparable with the coarser resolution product but catches much more spatial details, which is very beneficial to applications such as drought monitoring.},

The three electrodes in the sensor are counter electrode (CE), working electrode (WE), and the reference electrode (RE), which are analyzed by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV). The fundamental principle of this sensor is based on the ion sensitive membrane (ISM) used on the WE. Therefore, the valinomycin is used as the ISM for sensing the K+ ions.

The sensor is designed at the UHF RFID band so that it can be tweaked easily to a chip-based RFID sensor. Alongside the designed sensor, a theoretical soil model with different moisture and salinity levels is simulated here. A fabricated prototype is used to measure the variation of moisture and salinity levels in sandy soil. Both the simulated and measured results exhibit frequency shift of sensor resonance with moisture content variation at non-saline conditions. However, if the soil is saline, the resonance amplitude gets reduced with increased salinity levels and exhibits moisture content independence and hence no frequency variation.},

The DC and AC analysis is performed over the soil using this sensor to explore the properties of soil e.g. capacitance, dielectric constant etc. which can be very useful for many applications e.g. hydrology, agriculture and weather forecasting departments. The dielectric properties of different type of soils are studied at the frequency range of 100 Hz - 1 MHz and it is observed that dielectric constant of soil, which is directly proportional to capacitance, increases with increased moisture content of soil and decreases with it vice-versa. The DC analysis proves that the moisture content increases the electrical voltage of the soil by 70-80\% if compared with the dry soil electrical voltage, whereas AC analysis emphasis on the frequency range which is ideal for stable performance of designed capacitive soil moisture sensor.},

Besides the well-known time domain reflectometry (TDR), a new method, namely the time domain transmissometry (TDT) captures the market for soil moisture sensors. The key benefit of transmission measurements is their robustness against multiple reflections. However, the development of TDT sensors for measurements inside soils is a challenge due to specific geometric requirements. While transmission measurements are in general performed in two port setups, measurements inside soils require an one port setup. Hence, time domain sensors are in general based on reflection measurements. This contribution describes a soil moisture sensor, which combines the advantages of TDR and TDT measurements regarding the suitability for soil moisture measurements. The sensor consists of a concentric coaxial line assembly resulting in a compact setup. The measuring path is realized as an one-wire line to obtain a large cross sectional area and thus, a large soil sample volume.},

The soil contents were 67\% clay, 17\% lime and 16\% sand. Measurements of the soil water content were obtained using a TDR soil moisture sensor, (6050X1 Trase System), and the sensor described in this work. The neural network was trained using data obtained from the gravimetric method. The parameter chosen to evaluate the performance of the sensor was the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) of the measurements compared to the gravimetric method. The results showed that the sensor ITM-01, yields volumetric water content measurements in agreement with gravimetric and TDR measurements. In particular for the data reported in this work, the ITM-01 sensor delivered measurements closer to gravimetric data compared to data obtained using the TDR sensor.

In this study, the methods are blended at the field scale to estimate soil moisture under grassland in a synergistic as well as a stand-alone approach. Data from the TERENO Fendt test site near Weilheim (Germany) were recorded concurrently within the ScaleX campaign on 10th of July, 2015. The multisensor assessment reveals that PolSAR estimates benefit fundamentally from the in situ techniques to effectively remove the vegetation scattering component leading to very accurate permittivity estimates (RMSE {\textless}; 1 [-]). The PolSAR analyses verified the full applicability of the low-parameterized vegetation scattering model to sufficiently represent grassland cover. Moreover, the comparison of all moisture products indicates the constraint of PolSAR to assess only the surface moisture at L-band, while the other two techniques are able to assess also soil moisture of deeper layers, reaching down to the root zone.},

Sensors were designed in microstrip technology for use in wireless sensor networks for measurement and mapping of soil moisture in arable lands. Sensors detect transmission coefficient phase delay which is a function of the soil permittivity that is in turn in direct relation with soil moisture. Two novel sensors are proposed which operate at 2.54 GHz and 2.75 GHz. Both solutions offer two times wider ranges of the phase delay and from three to almost thirteen times greater sensitivities compared to conventional microstrip sensor solutions.},

A prototype was fabricated and applied to two soil types (sandy and garden soils), achieving a good resolution between the dry and saturated states. Despite the attractive and encouraging results, one of the most important paper contributions is the introduced sensor concept, which can be optimized for different applications, taking advantage of matryoshka DGS characteristics. Furthermore, considering the integration of the sensor in a remote unit, it is still possible to take advantage of an already available RF stage.},

This activity is practiced by farmers in various economic conditions, and the group of small and medium producers the most. Because this class does not have many improvements in investment conditions on their plantations, it ends up having a huge difficulty to grow economically and reach the level of big farmers. This paper seeks an alternative technology to help this disadvantaged sector to have access to measurement instruments at an affordable value, through the development of a soil moisture transmitter. First, a filter has been developed to build the transmitter. Then many tests were performed divided into two steps, tests on water and tests on soil. From the test results, computational tools were used to raise the necessary validation of the curves. Using the coefficient of determination R2 as a technique of regression analysis was reached close to 1, which represents the maximum value if one wants to measure the closeness of two curves, and thus was considered to be a satisfactory result. At the end of the project, has reached the objective of developing a low cost soil moisture transmitter.},

A variant of the nichrome sensor was one that employed a ceramic tube with four longitudinal holes that eliminated the need for Parylene coating.

This method, similarly to TDR, is mainly used to measure parameters of transmission lines and connectors. It is also suitable for determining the dielectric properties of materials from which the transmission line is built. It is known that water has high dielectric permittivity of about 80. This means that the volumetric water content of the soil has a decisive influence on its dielectric properties. A transmission line placed in the soil can be a detector of dielectric properties and then soil moisture. For these reasons, the TDR and TDT methods are commonly used to measure and monitor soil moisture. The selection of materials shape and construction of the transmission line are a constant challenge for the sensor designers. The probe should be watertight and materials used for construction should not absorb water.

The use of capacitive soil moisture sensor exploits the very property of soil that the dielectric value of soil varies with the amount of water content [2], [3]. Use of a capacitive sensor for soil moisture measurement provides some advantages such as better accuracy after soil-specific calibration, high sensitivity, flexibility in probe design, easy installation and cost-effectiveness. A copper cladded epoxy material, coated with a thin film of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer, is an established procedure to fabricate the sensor [3], [4], which has been used here for soil moisture sensing. This paper describes the development of a rechargeable battery-operated hand-held meter for fieldwork by using this PMMA coated sensor along with a suitable signal conditioning circuit. The thermo-gravimetric method has been utilized to obtain the actual moisture content of soil [5] and calibrate it with respect to the voltage output of the meter. Moreover, with the moisture content, surrounding temperature and humidity are also useful atmospheric parameters used by weather stations [6]. For this, a DHT12 sensor has been integrated with this hand-held meter. IoT extension of measured data is implemented by a SIM900A GPRS/GSM modem to make the meter smart.},

Either excess or lack of water leads to uneven crop development and may result in loss of yield. Therefore, there is a need to implement a smart irrigation system to monitor moisture levels. It helps in regulating water supply to the field and using resources effectively. This paper proposes a power-effective smart irrigation system with a hygrometer sensor to measure the moisture content in the soil. The proposed sensor is calibrated for its resistance and is proportional to the moisture level. The novelty of this work is in terms of low cost and low power consumption. We envision a smart IoT (Internet of Things) system with a large magnitude of sensor nodes monitoring the moisture levels of plants on the farm. The existing sensor nodes in the market are costly and consume excessive power. Thus, a system built with these sensors is not scalable. We propose a sensor node based on the Schmitt trigger, which takes the hygrometer sensor output resistance as the input and gives the output in terms of voltage. The sensor output can decide whether to turn OFF/ON the water supply to the soil. The output from this circuit can be sent to the farmer at a remote location using IoT.},

Therefore, we use three different remote sensing methods to map the soil moisture change as well as the volumetric water content following a storm event in the hyper-arid, unvegetated, and karstic Qatar Peninsula: (1) C-band SENTINEL1 SAR backscatter intensity difference as well as its interferometric coherence, (2) Principal Component Analysis SENTINEL2-multispectral moisture index, and (3) L-band SMAP Level3 radiometer.

The proposed system is affordable due to its indigenous ASIC, which can be mass-produced. The sensor module measures \$37 mm {\textbackslash}times 73 mm\$ and weighs 7 gm. The additional modularity, with a power, control, and communication module, provides flexibility in interfacing with different applications.},

The objective of the technology is to enable a guided/adaptive sampling strategy for the in-situ sensor network to meet the measurement validation objectives of the spaceborne sensors with respect to resolution and accuracy. The sensor nodes are guided to perform as a macro-instrument measuring processes at the scale of the satellite footprint, hence meeting the requirements for the difficult problem of validation of satellite measurements. The science measurement considered is the surface-to-depth profiles of soil moisture estimated from satellite radars and radiometers, with calibration/validation using in-situ sensors. Satellites allow global mapping but with coarse footprints. The total variability in soil-moisture fields comes from variability in processes on various scales. Installing an in-situ network to sample the field for all ranges of variability is impractical. However, a sparser but smarter network can provide the validation estimates by operating in a guided fashion with guidance from its own sparse measurements. The feedback and control take place in the context of a data assimilation system. The design and demonstration of the smart sensor web including the control architecture, assimilation framework, and actuation hardware are the building blocks of this concept and will be introduced in the presentation. This technology, once developed, enables a guided/adaptive sampling strategy for generating optimal, statistically unbiased, calibration/validation data for space-based measurements.},

Water stress and groundwater salinity are the twin problems associated with excessive groundwater extraction and irrigation with saline water. Small and marginal farmers are the majority in India and require low-cost sensors for soil moisture and EC measurement. This work evaluates the performance of a low-cost device for soil moisture and EC measurement in different soil types. In soils with low EC and uniform particle size distribution, the sensor output is linear with \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ of 0.94-0.96. However, in most field soils, the linear-fit \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ varies from 0.74 to 0.84 depending on soil type, soil EC, and bulk density. Since the bulk EC and bulk density vary with soil moisture, the Pearson correlation test shows that bulk EC and bulk density have a moderate correlation with sensor output (oscillation frequency) for moisture measurement. So the impact of bulk EC and bulk density on soil moisture measurement cannot be ignored.},

The objective is to determine the response of the proposed sensor in measuring the soil moisture content for various level.

Changes in sensor capacitance value indicate the change in soil moisture levels, generating a signal in AM circuit, which were then converted using Arduino microcontroller and displayed on the LCD screen. The test showed that, the range value for sand samples are 78,662 to 1,035 Hz, while for clay are 74,551 to 932 Hz.

A DPHP sensor has the heater probe kept at a distance from the temperature sensor probe. Heater probe consist of nichrome wire as the heating element, which is embedded in the stainless-steel tube. In this paper, we examine the acceptable tolerance in the heater resistance across 25 DPHP sensors, for the accurate soil moisture measurement. For this purpose, we used in-house developed 25 DPHP sensors where heater resistance is about 56 \${\textbackslash}Omega\$ with \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 5\% tolerance.

The model allows a conversion of Vertical-Vertical (VV) polarization into soil moisture. The model is calibrated with 2019 CRNS data and validated with data from 2020 to 2021. The results showed the good performance of the model with a high correlation for the calibration (R2 = 0.81) and predicted the soil moisture with an absolute error of 0.2\%.

However, common measurement systems only provide an average value of the dielectric constant along the length of the TDR sensor. Furthermore the accuracy offered by common TDR measurements is limited due to multiple reflections caused by the material under test. This contribution deals with a new sensor design for the characterization of soil moisture using time domain transmission (TDT) measurements. The basis of the advanced TDT technique is a new waveguide concept, which offers the possibility to perform transmission measurements in soils. Thus multiple reflections along the waveguide do not influence the measurement accuracy. By using a so-called "concentric reversion coupler" TDT measurements can be performed without a measuring port at the end of the sensor.},

However, the effects of multiresolution imagery on modeling of biogeochemical soil properties in aquatic ecosystems are still poorly understood. The objectives of this study were the following: 1) to develop prediction models for soil total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) utilizing RS images and environmental ancillary data at three different resolutions; 2) to identify controlling factors of the spatial distribution of soil TP and TN; and 3) to elucidate the effects of different spatial resolutions of RS images on inferential modeling. Soil cores were collected (n = 108) from the top 10 cm in a subtropical wetland: Water Conservation Area-2A, the Florida Everglades, USA. The spectral data and derived indices from RS images, which have different spatial resolutions, included the following: MODIS (500 m resampled to 250 m), Landsat ETM+ (30 m), and SPOT (10 m). Block kriging and random forest (RF) were employed to predict soil TP and TN using RS-image-derived spectral input variables, environmental ancillary data, and soil observations. The RF models showed R2 between 0.90 and 0.93 and root mean square error between 100.4 and 115.9 mg · kg-1 for TP and between 1.45 and 1.52 g · kg-1 for TN. Soil TP was mainly predicted from RS-derived spectral indices that infer on biotic/vegetation characteristics, whereas soil TN was predicted using a combination of biotic/vegetation, topographic, and hydrologic variables. Results suggest that the spectral data informed soil models have excellent predictive capabilities in this aquatic ecosystem. Interestingly, there was no noticeable distinction among different spatial resolutions of RS images to develop prediction models for soil TP and TN in terms of error assessment. However, the variability and complexity of soil TP and TN variations were much better expressed with the finer resolution RFSPOT model than the coarser resolution RFMODIS model as demonstrated using entropy.},

Sensing technology has been used for a long time to determine the exact amount of soil nutrients without going through a conventional time-consuming, and expensive laboratory testing process. Several types of sensors are developed to measure the quantity of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) present in the soil, basically known as NPK sensor that provides on-the-go detection. A significant need for compact, inexpensive, low-power, and rapid soil NPK sensors is anticipated due to the demand for enhanced agriculture production and the future widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT). This fact implies using advanced technologies for both sensing elements and rapid detection. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have also been utilized to optimize soil NPK levels. These techniques involve training models on large datasets of soil samples and their corresponding nutrient levels, allowing for accurate prediction of nutrient concentrations based on sensor data. Only the sensing devices primarily used in agriculture applications will be discussed in this review. The prominent technologies and methods used in agriculture will be explored with regard to research and development ever held in agricultural sensing devices for measuring soil parameters. These elementary methods of determining the soil parameters may be grouped into two classes: conventional and emerging. We expect this review to guide the researchers and provide an approach to the study related to producing a convenient, affordable, and efficient soil NPK detection sensor.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in situ sensors. Continuously sampling moisture levels with these sensors incurs high-maintenance and energy consumption costs, which are particularly undesirable for wireless networks. Our main hypothesis is that a sparser set of measurements can meet the monitoring objectives in an energy-efficient manner. The underlying idea is that we can trade off some inaccuracy in estimating soil moisture evolution for a significant reduction in energy consumption. We investigate how to dynamically schedule the sensor measurements so as to balance this tradeoff. Unlike many prior studies on sensor scheduling that make generic assumptions on the statistics of the observed phenomenon, we obtain statistics of soil moisture evolution from a physical model. We formulate the optimal measurement scheduling and estimation problem as a partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP). We then utilize special features of the problem to approximate the POMDP by a computationally simpler finite-state Markov decision problem (MDP).

Key sensing methodologies developed for monitoring soil moisture and nutrients with recent advances in the sensing devices reported in literature using those techniques are overviewed in this article. The soil moisture determination has been divided into four main sections describing soil moisture measurement metrics and laboratory-based testing, followed by in-situ, remote and proximal sensing techniques. The application, advantages and limitations for each of the mentioned technologies are discussed. The nutrient monitoring methods are reviewed beginning with laboratory-based methods, ion-selective membrane based sensors, bio-sensors, spectroscopy-based methods, and capillary electrophoresis-based systems for inorganic ion detection. Attention has been given to the core principle of detection while reporting recent sensors developed using the mentioned concepts. The latest works reported on the different sensing methodologies point towards the trend of developing low-cost, easy to use, field-deployable or portable sensing systems aimed towards improving technology adoption in crop production leading to efficient site-specific soil and crop management which in turn will bring us closer to reaching sustainability in the practice of agriculture.},

Remote sensing data from the European Copernicus mission are highly acknowledged to serve as fast, reliable, and available suppliers for the derivation of area wide, high grid-resolution information (20 m × 20 m) on near-surface soil moisture patterns acquired at a regular temporal resolution (satellite overpass is every six days). To reliably map \${\textbackslash}theta\$ from remote sensing radar (i.e., Sentinel-1) satellite products, robust calibration with gridded ground-data is needed and use of either sporadically measured or continuously monitored \${\textbackslash}theta\$ is of crucial importance for validation procedures. This study integrates remote- and ground-based monitoring of local-to field-scale \${\textbackslash}theta\$ in the Alento hydrological observatory situated in southern Italy. This Critical Zone Observatory was recently established in the Mediterranean Region and equipped with a multi-sensor network infrastructure. The final aim of this study is to develop site-specific calibration functions to relate spectral measurements to gridded topographic features to estimate near-surface soil moisture patterns. Estimation performance will be evaluated by comparing remote sensing-based (Sentinel-1) with ground-based soil moisture measured during satellite overpass. The soil moisture transfer relations will eventually support high temporal catchment-based hydrological modeling of groundwater and surface water fluxes under consideration of the climatic variability and in feedback with the vegetation.},

The commonly used in-situ measurements are not feasible for mapping soil moisture at large-scale agricultural areas. Local direct root-zone soil moisture measurements cannot be reliably interpolated owing to the high spatial variability of soil structure and the vegetative content. Remote sensing methods are negatively affected by vegetation coverage and density regarding penetration and backscattering characteristics. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a root-zone soil moisture estimation method utilizing a context-aware data clustering process, which can be applied prior to any statistical analysis, for empirical evaluation of data. In this aspect, the crops' phenological stages and soil-air temperature differences are defined as the two contexts for data clustering. Parameters such as canopy-air temperature difference, land surface temperature, and solar radiation with respect to plant energy and water processes are used for the analysis. The proposed model is utilized using piecewise linear regression of data obtained from 16 rainfed wheat parcels distributed across Turkey, under different climatic and topographic conditions. It is shown that the proposed context-aware data clustering process enables the nonlinear plant behavior to be analyzed linearly. The correlation value of the whole season increased from 21\% to a range between 78\% and 95\% for different clusters. The outliers became relevant and the parameters became significant after the proposed context-aware data clustering.},

	abstract = {Due to the coarse spatial resolution of currently available microwave (mostly passive) soil moisture (SM) products, it is difficult to apply these SM data in watersheds or at local scales. To this end, a number of downscaling approaches have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of microwave SM products. Specifically, the optical-/thermal-based downscaling methods are most widely used in recent decades. However, such methods normally rely on instantaneous optical/thermal land surface parameters, which are commonly inapplicable under cloudy conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop a new downscaling method based on the temporal variation in geostationary satellite-derived land surface temperature and net surface shortwave radiation. The proposed method has a certain potential to improve data availability under cloudy conditions, because geostationary satellites are capable of providing land surface parameters at high temporal resolution. The proposed method was tested over the REMEDHUS network in Spain. The scaling strategy of cumulative distribution function matching was used to remove systematic differences in spatial mismatch between satellite pixels and in situ SM measurements. Results indicate that the downscaled SM agrees well with in situ measurements and has comparable accuracy with the original microwave SM product. The overall root mean square errors with the in situ measurements for the original microwave SM and the downscaled SM are 0.054 and 0.057  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ , respectively. This method not only has a successful attempt to downscale microwave SM data using temporal information but also has the potential to avoid the failure of traditional instantaneous observations-based downscaling procedure due to clouds.},

Through utilizing the active components and the soil moisture content, we can train RBF neural network. Finally, optimize and record the network. In the practical application, aiming at a particular frequency of GPR, through multiple regression, we can predict the soil moisture content better than the RBF neural network only.

Passive and active microwave satellite sensors are suitable for quantifying the moisture in the first centimeters of the soil. Passive sensors allow precise soil moisture estimation, but with low spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to fuse them with products with better spatial resolution to enhance their applications. The main problem for re-scaling soil moisture is to find a variable whose spatial variability were similar to that of soil moisture. In this paper the improvement of the pixel size of SMAP images are proposed by their fusion with precipitation maps of the GPM mission. Although there are different fusion techniques, the wavelets and principal component methods are selected for this work, since the literature indicates that they are the most used. The results suggest that GPM precipitation maps are suitable for introducing variability in soil moisture maps and that wavelets results in lower errors than the principal component method, when compared with in situ data.

	abstract = {The meteorological Bureau of Anhui Province has deployed DZN2 soil moisture stations since 2009. The layout of the site has greatly reduced the labor capacity of traditional manual observation and increased the spatial and temporal density of observation data for drought monitoring, agricultural meteorological forecasting services and great contribution. In the long-term operation process, due to changes in the observation environment, site migration, and daily maintenance of the site, in recent years, the quality of the automatic soil moisture observation data has decreased, and the observation data has a large deviation from the actual state of the soil characteristics, such as the province. The surface cracks caused by the continuous drought in the central and northern areas, especially in the clay and loam clay areas, make the observation data significantly smaller. The long-term accumulation of water in the field is not discharged in time, causing the soil to continue to be too wet, etc., and it becomes the daily soil moisture data of our province. A big problem in business applications. In this paper, a series of calibration tests were carried out on Shouxian Station in Huainan, and the data before and after the test were compared and analyzed. Before the test, the measured value of the relative humidity of the shallow layer (10-20 cm) of the station showed that the section was moderately moderately dry. However, after on-site investigation, the low machine measurement is due to soil cracking around the sensor of the soil moisture observer. Soil cracking is caused by the hydration expansion of clay. When the moisture of the moist soil evaporates quickly, the soil around the protective tube shrinks due to the exclusion of the protective tube and the soil, thereby forming a crack. As the evapotranspiration increases, the cracks will continue to develop deeper, and the key is to prevent surface cracking. Test rectification plan: When the undisturbed soil test was carried out in the laboratory, it was found that the crack formation was around the soil box, and no cracks were formed around the PVC protection tube. Thus, the idea of separating the soil within a certain range of the PVC sheath to maintain the original shape of the sensor is generated. This paper designs and processes a set of acrylic material drums and installs PVC protection pipes into the center of the drum. After the installation of the acrylic material drum, the field artificial soil test was carried out. It can be seen from the data reading software that in the calibration test, the measured value of soil moisture relative humidity of the station, especially the shallow layer and the artificial value, is very good, and a certain effect is obtained. Since it does not experience continuous drought and less rain, whether the method can solve the problem of soil cracking around the sensor well needs time verification. After the completion of the network of soil moisture automatic observation stations, the instrument plays an active role in the soil moisture monitoring business for agricultural meteorological services. Subsequent new construction and relocation sites are essential for business calibration. In the commercial calibration, especially for the observation of environmental changes and site migration and other issues leading to significant errors or even data errors, site surveys should be conducted to find out the reasons for rectification and to ensure the accuracy of soil moisture observation.},

Taking the advantage of the multi-incident angles of the ERS Wind Scatterometer(WSC), a new soil moisture retrieving method, that significantly improves the surface backscattering presentation, is proposed in this study based on the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) and the Water-Cloud model. It utilizes the correlations in each backscattering components (bare soil and vegetation) for the simultaneous measurements of each incident angle pairs to reduce the effect of surface roughness and vegetation scattering on soil moisture estimation. The result is validated by using the ground measurements from the Intensive Observation Period (IOP’98) field campaign in 1998 of GAME/Tibet in the end of this paper, and the time series of the estimated soil moisture shows a consistent trend with those sampled on the ground.},

The roughness index is used to describe the soil surface roughness condition. The new algorithm assumes the roughness condition is constant over a shot time, so that the roughness index retrieval accuracy can be improved by using temporal data to minimizing the effect of radar speckle noise. The uncertainty of the roughness index is predicted by using an error propagation theory. By applying the retrieved roughness index and corresponding uncertainty as a constraint, a Bayesian approach, which takes account the uncertainties of radar observation, is implemented. The algorithm is validated with a field ground dataset at 1.25 Ghz and 40° incidence angle. The result shows an rms error (RMSE) of 0.06 cm3/cm3 for soil moisture. The correlation coefficient between retrieved soil moisture and in situ data is 0.81. Surface rms height estimates are found with RMSE of 0.41 cm and correlation coefficient of 0.99. It is shown that the new algorithm using time-series data outperforms the Bayesian approach without using temporal information and snapshot method.},

The observations from spaceborne passive microwave sensors for more than 30 years are very valuable for generating historical soil moisture maps.

To rebuild long-term soil moisture data sets with an improved accuracy, a method to correct vegetation effects at X-band or higher frequencies using L-band soil moisture retrievals is explored in this study.

With the advantages of high precision, high spatial and temporal resolution, and non-destructive, the automatic soil moisture observing instrument has become an important component of automatic soil moisture observation station for the meteorological department in china. In the process of observing soil moisture, the accuracy of data is seriously affected by the calibration methods, equipment stability, soil texture, etc. Therefore, it is especially important to establish a quality control method for the automatic soil moisture observation data from the origin of affecting the observation quality. To solve the outstanding quality problems in the automatic soil moisture observation data, firstly, based on the historical data, the inherent variation characteristics of soil moisture were studied. Secondly, combined with the instrument observation principle, data characteristics and error sources of abnormal data, classified and statistical analyzed the form of abnormal data caused by various reasons and given the threshold, this paper preliminarily puts forward a practical set of quality control methods for the hourly soil moisture observation data. Finally, the application effect of the quality control method was verified by using the data in china in 2019. The result shows that: (1) Four mainly categories of abnormal data are gross errors, mutation, abnormal high values, and stiffness, which are mostly caused by instrument failure, abnormal soil hydrological constant, and unreasonable calibration of sensors. (2) The method of frequency characteristic detection can identify the error caused by instrument fault. (3) This quality control method can effectively detect abnormal data in china. At present, the method has been applied to the Integrated Meteorology Observation Data Quality Control System.},

To conduct this study, four RADARSAT-2 images acquired at different modes during the summer of 2008 over agriculture fields located in Saskatoon (Saskatchewan, Canada) were used. The available data are ground measurements of soil moisture, surface roughness and vegetation characteristics. The comparison between retrieval and ground soil moisture showed average absolute relative errors of about 35\% and 55\% for fine and ScanSAR mode images respectively. Indeed, a weak amelioration was obtained from the up scaling of the ground soil moisture data to the spatial scale of the different radar image.},

First, NDWI was calculated using a time series data of Sentinel-2 and then converted to vegetation water content (mveg). With the help of the water cloud model, the influence of vegetation on the backscattering coefficient is eliminated. Then, in order to make the change detection method (CDM) more reasonable, a method for removing influence of roughness change on backscattering coefficient is proposed. It uses the difference between co-polarization and cross-polarization ( σ0vv - σ0vh) for roughness normalization. SSM was obtained by combining the soil relative moisture retrieved from the time series data of Sentinel-1 with the maximum and minimum water content of the study area within one year obtained from the SMAP data. The results showed that the MRE of SSM extracted by ICDM was 8.34\%, which was less than 17.49\% of CDM.},

Soil moisture products, nor-mally retrieved from microwave remote sensing data, are typically not suitable for regional hydrological and agricultural applications such as irrigation management and flood predictions, due to their coarse spatial resolution. Providing accurate information on soil moisture at an appropriate temporal and spatial scale is challenging for traditional interpolation methods, due to the high variability of soil moisture.

While the classical retrieval approach considers SM and τNAD (vegetation optical depth) as retrieved parameters, this approach is based on the retrieval of SM and the TR parameter combining τNAD and soil roughness (TR = τNAD + HR/2). Different roughness parameterizations were tested to find the best correlation (R), bias and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) when comparing homogeneous retrievals of SM and in situ SM measurements carried out at the VAS (Valencia Anchor Station) vineyard field. The highest R (0.68) and lowest ubRMSE (0.056 m3 m−3) were found using the SRP method. Using the SMOS observations comparisons against several SM networks were also made: AACES, SCAN, watersheds and SMOSMANIA. SM was retrieved over all these stations. The SRP and another similar approach (SRP2) improved the averaged ubRMSE, while the SRP2 method leaded to higher correlation values (R). A global underestimation of SM was noticed, which may be linked to the differences in the sampling depths of the L-band observations (∼ 0–3cm for both Elbara-II and SMOS) and of the in situ measurements (∼ 0–5 cm).},

The three-cornered hat (TCH) method is essentially an optimal solution based on the numerical method, allowing an arbitrary number of datasets (at least three) to simultaneously participate in the calculation, with a tolerance to the error cross-correlation to a certain extent. However, in TCH, only a basic error model is adopted, which describes the products as mutually differing only in an additive random error. This violates our common recognition of the error model (i.e., affine error model) applied to describing products like soil moisture (SM). This work aims to improve the TCH method by updating the basic error model with the affine error model, and the reliability of the improved TCH method is evaluated using simulated soil moisture datasets and multisource soil moisture products against in-situ SM measurements.},

The L band radar was also shown to be sensitive to near surface soil moisture. However, the spatial resolution of a typical satellite L band radiometer is of the order of tens of kilometers, which is not sufficient to serve the full range of science needs for land surface hydrology and weather modeling applications. Disaggregation schemes for deriving sub pixel estimates of soil moisture from radiometer data using higher resolution radar observations may provide the means for making available global soil moisture observations at much finer scale. This paper presents a simple approach for disaggregation of coarser resolution radiometer estimates of soil moisture using higher resolution radar backscatter and vegetation water content measurements. The algorithm has been applied to coincident PALS radiometer and Airsar datasets of 400 m and 30 m spatial resolutions respectively acquired during the SMEX02 campaign. PALS radiometer estimates of soil moisture at a 400 m resolution have been disaggregated to 100 m resolution.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing technology shows huge advantages in obtaining large-scale, high spatio-temporal resolution soil moisture (SM) datasets. However, the high variability across different remote sensing SM datasets induced by different retrieval algorithms and different radiative transfer models used in these algorithms presents a considerable challenge to get the right choice in different applications. To overcome this challenge, we proposed a comprehensive multi-source SM fusion framework based on machine learning models. This framework uncovers intrinsic connections between multi-source SM datasets and various geographic and climatic factors, enhancing the quality of multi-source SM datasets and mitigating data uncertainties. The framework consists of two critical processes: firstly, the identification of key environmental factors closely related to SM spatio-temporal dynamics, and secondly, the rational stratification and sampling of data samples across the whole area. A stratified k-fold cross-validation method was employed to train and validate the machine learning models. We evaluated the fusion dataset accuracy based on 594 ground-observed SM stations. Results demonstrated improved performance of the fusion framework after incorporating geographic and climatic information. The simulation performance hierarchy was observed as follows: Fusion of multi-source SM datasets and geographic-climatic environmental factors (median R2 ∈ [0.32,0.52]) {\textgreater} Fusion considering only multi-source soil moisture datasets (median R2 ∈ [0.23,0.36]) {\textgreater} Fusion considering only geographic-climatic environmental factors (median R2 ∈ [0.11,0.19]). Additionally, the fusion datasets exhibited higher accuracy than single satellite/reanalysis SM datasets. The fusion dataset I, constructed from separate watersheds (median CC: 0.69–0.82, median RMSE: 0.063–0.067m3/m3), outperformed fusion dataset II, constructed from the whole area (median CC: 0.67–0.78, median RMSE: 0.071–0.089m3/m3). The high-quality SM dataset obtained through this fusion approach seamlessly integrates information from multi-sources SM datasets, groundbased SM observations, and geographic-climatic environmental factors. This integration is poised to enhance applications in regional hydrology, ecology, agriculture, and meteorology.},

	abstract = {In this article, a method for the simultaneous measurement of total biomass, vegetation water content, and soil moisture is developed based on ultra-wideband (UWB) nadir observation of the reflection coefficient in the frequency range from 450 MHz to 6 GHz. The proposed method is based on a simple model of plane wave reflection from a vegetation layer with flat boundaries lying on a smooth soil surface. The model does not take into account the phenomena of wave scattering on the vegetation elements and the soil surface roughness. The dielectric constant of the vegetation canopy and soil were calculated based on Ulaby and Mironov dielectric models, respectively. The proposed method was tested using data from PORTOS-93 (INRA) experiments on measuring: total biomass (up to 3.3 kg/m2), water content (43\%-89\%), height (up to 1m) and volumetric content (up to 0.6-0.8\%) of wheat plants, moisture (from 5\% to 36\%), density and clay fraction content (27\%) of the soil. As a result, it was shown, the coefficient of determination \$({\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\})\$ and root-mean-square error (RMSE) appeared to be equal to \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=0.999\$ and RMSE=2.2\% when comparing the original and retrieved values of volumetric soil moisture. The retrieved values of total biomass (vegetation water content) with the coefficient of determination \${\textbackslash}mathrm\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{2\}=0.999\$ (0.998) and RMSE=16g/m2 (0.7\%) coincide with the original set values. Therewith, the bands from 4 GHz to 6 GHz and from 450 MHz to 1 GHz were used to retrieve the canopy biometric parameters and soil moisture, respectively.},

	abstract = {In soil moisture remote sensing products ground verification, the soil moisture in-situ sampling is heterogeneous and not consistent with the remote sensing pixel scale. So, it is very important that extensive sampling soil moisture of the surface heterogeneous and effective upscaling multi-point in situ soil moisture to remote sensing pixel scale. However, it is very difficult to collect them extensively if the soil moisture signal is complicated or dynamically changing. Considering the sparsity of soil moisture and the effects of observation noise, this paper models the linear programming problem between the soil moisture remote sensing pixel and in-situ sampling data using hierarchical non-parametric Bayesian linear regression. This model does not assume that the specific distribution of regression parameters which will be learned adaptively by the nonparametric Bayesian method. In addition, we implement the Dirichlet process to exploit the spatial similarity of the in-situ sampling data of soil moisture, thus to improve the spatial upscaling accuracy. Due to the Dirichlet process without explicit mathematical expression, the model of the posteriori probability distribution is very hard to deal with. To this end, the Gibbs sampling scheme based on MCMC (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) is adopted to infer the optimal regression weighting coefficient, and the spatial scale of the soil moisture in situ sampling is effectively upscaled. The experimental results show that the spatial upscaling method of non-parametric Bayesian linear regression is closer to the observed remote sensing pixel scale and better than the state of the art Bayesian method and Kriging method.},

The effectiveness and robustness of the method are validated by the Australian Soil Moisture Monitoring Network and ESA Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture data. By comparing with in situ SM measurements and the spatial patterns of the CCI SM, the R of the downscaled 1km SM reaches 0.694 with a bias of 0.027.

For this purpose, we apply the Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM), which is a well-established theoretical scattering model, to simulate complete sets of bistatic scattering coefficients, over a wide range of surface roughness and dielectric parameters. The sensitivities of radar response to soil moisture and surface roughness are identified and quantified in terms of bistatic geometries and radar parameters. The results show that the autocorrelation functions (ACFs), which significantly affect the distribution of sensitivity indices of surface roughness, do not exert distinct effects on the bistatic sensitivity pattern of soil moisture. In bistatic scattering, VV polarization shows higher sensitivity to soil moisture than HH polarization, particularly at large incident angles. As incident angle increases, in cases of small azimuth scattering angles and large scattering angles, the sensitivity zone expands and tends to move to the forward region at VV polarization. This feature persists regardless of the ACFs, and thus offers promising configurations for soil moisture retrieval. For HH polarization, in contrast, the sensitivity zone gradually moves to the backward region as the incident angle increases.},

	abstract = {The soil evaporation is under atmospheric conditions non-limited in energy-strongly linked to the near-surface soil moisture sensed by microwave radiometers. This has been the rationale for developing the DisPATCh (Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change) method, which relies on thermal-derived evaporation to improve the spatial resolution of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) like data. In practice, the disaggregation scheme estimates the 0-5 cm soil moisture at 1 km resolution by combining 40 km SMOS soil moisture, 1 km resolution MODIS (MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data, and a multi-scale soil evaporation model. This paper provides an overview of 1) the current status and main assumptions of DisPATCh, 2) the DisPATCh-based processor implemented in the Centre Aval de Traitement des Données SMOS (CATDS), and 3) related ongoing research including advanced modeling of soil evaporation and the prospect of coupling thermal- and radar-based soil moisture downscaling approaches.},

The paper established a new interpolation method used the time series observation data which obtained by ground sensor network as as data source, based on the theory of signal superposition, and combined spatial analysis and optimal interpolation theory. Firstly, the observed value is divided into the trend part and the residual value by the way of wavelet decomposition. Then interpolate the two part Separately through High accuracy surface modeling(HASM) and improved residual function modeling. Finally, get the final result by adding the two parts according to the signal superposition principle. The experiment used the soil moisture observation data set obtained by ground sensor network at Heihe area for the month of 2012 5–9.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important parameter to be monitored in agricultural activities. Estimation on soil moisture is as important as understanding the process of hydrology and ecology. Nowadays, how to acquire extensive soil moisture information has became the key to this problem due to insufficient performance of water models. Remote sensing technology is able to obtain essential soil moisture information on a large scale quickly and efficiently. In order to integrate high coverage of microwave data with higher spatial resolution of optical/infrared satellite data, a downscaling algorithm is evaluated for the improvement of soil moisture at temporal and spatial resolution using AMSR-E/AMSR-2 (The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - EOS/2) and MODIS (The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer). The turbulent energy fluxes which link passive microwave derived soil moisture with several factors (eg: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST(Land Surface Temperature), albedo) at high resolution through evapotranspiration. Based on “universal triangle method”, NDVI, albedo, and LST from MODIS are used to downscale AMSR-E/AMSR-2 daily soil moisture from 25km to 1km in this study. With linear relationships between microwave soil moisture and several parameters (NDVI, LST, albedo), specific downscaling parameters of satellite images for same date which represents unique relations between soil moisture and energy flux was calculated through multivariate linear model between soil moisture at coarse resolution and several parameters(NDVI, LST, albedo). Downscaled soil moisture was obtained by calculation with downscaling parameters and NDVI, LST and albedo at higher spatial resolution. Because of discrepancy of different spatio-temporal scale between satellite date and in situ point data used in validation, we used a algorithm to rescale downscaled result to remove systematic differences. The scatter plot and linear fit of 10 years downscaled soil moisture and measured soil moisture in 10 cm depth from different agro-meteorological station in Inner Mongolia is plotted and analyzed. The performance of this algorithm is assessed by comparing the obtained daily downscaling results at 1 km with in situ soil moisture point measurement (10 cm depth) from agro-meteorological station in Inner Mongolia. The result showed that scatter plot and linear fit of 10 years downscaled soil moisture and station observation of 10 cm depth soil moisture with its bias and RMSE of -0.094 and 0.092. Results showed that downscaled soil moisture at 1km enable to represent value and variability of soil moisture content at a large scale and perform better than satellite data from single source because of higher coverage and spatial-temporal resolution.},

Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology is a promising solution for automating irrigation procedures and improving farming efficiency by removing human faults. In this article, a new method is introduced to measure soil moisture level along with providing energy to run a low-power transmitter as an alarm signal. A combination of a metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) and two rectifiers that are designed at different frequencies specifies 5\% and 25\% soil moisture levels. The sensor monitors the soil moisture continuously without consuming energy. Once the soil moisture becomes 5\% of the first rectifier starts working and provides 65 uW dc output, while the second rectifier is off. Increasing the soil moisture to 25\%, the second rectifier creates 100 uW dc output when the first rectifier is off. The designed structure is fabricated on RO4003 in a  \$4 {\textbackslash}times 4\$  array. The measurement results are provided by performing a set of different experiments. Initially, the MPA’s absorption characteristics are validated facing different polarization and incident angles. Then, the sensing capability is proven by burying the proposed sensor under sand and measuring the dc outputs of rectifiers. A strong correlation between simulation and measurement results validates the design procedure.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture sensing is important for many different monitoring applications. Especially for a dam monitoring system, soil moisture is one of the most safety-critical parameters. The coverage area of spot based soil moisture sensors is very limited and they mostly provide insignificant benefits, if the area of interest is not largely known. The developed Soil Moisture Sensing system uses the radio field as a sensor and covers a larger area with minimum invasion, even at locations difficult to reach. The radio field between buried nodes provides information about the channel conditions allowing assessments to be made of the soil characteristics within the communication channel. Long Range packet radio modules, originate from the Internet of Things, ensure a robust communication with a high receiver sensitivity enabling an application as Wireless Underground Sensors. In this paper, the sensing system is used for a long-term evaluation of the soil moisture at the airside of the Bever dam near to Wuppertal in Germany. It is shown that the measured Received Signal Strength Indicator variation of the underground communication link quality enables a classification of precipitation events. Further, the experimental setup of a sensor field in the laboratory performs a segmentation based soil moisture sensing and visualizes the moisture with a higher resolution. This concept is transferred to the Long Range approach while ensuring a reasonable trade-off between evaluation accuracy and battery lifetime.},

Two transmission notches are observed for identical loads relating to T2-SR and CR2-SR. The CR2-SR notch at 4.39 GHz is used as a reference for differential permittivity measurement method. Further, the resonance frequency of T2-SR is measured relative to the reference value. Based on this frequency difference, the permittivity of soil is calculated which is related to the soil VWC. Triangular two-turn resonator (T2-SR) resonance frequency changes from 4 to 2.38 GHz when VWC varies 0\% to 30\%. The sensor’s operation principle is described through circuit model analysis and simulations.

	abstract = {In this paper, the estimation distortion of distributed soil moisture measurement using Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) is investigated. The main focus of this paper is to analyze the impact of the environment and network parameters on the estimation distortion of the soil moisture. More specifically, the effects of rainfall, soil porosity, and vegetation root zone are investigated by exploiting a rainfall model, in addition to the effects of sampling rate, network topology, and measurement signal noise ratio. Spatio-temporal correlation is characterized to develop a measurement distortion model with respect to these factors. The evaluations reveal that with porous soil and shallow vegetation roots, high sampling rate is required for sufficient accuracy. In addition, the impact of rainfall on the estimation distortion has also been investigated. In a storm, which carries on a large area and lasts for a long time, the estimation distortion is decreased because of the increase in spatial correlation. Moreover, only few closest sensors are needed to estimate the values of an interested location. These findings are utilized to guide the design of WUSNs for soil moisture measurement to reduce the density of network and the sampling rate of the sensors but at the same time maintain the performance of the system. Moreover, guidelines for designing WUSNs for soil moisture measurement are provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that establishes tight relations between environmental effects and distributed measurement in WUSNs.},

These devices harvest environmental energy resources to supply their power and transfer their collected data using wireless RF links. In many instances, the power supplied from the environment is far less than the power required by the sensor device. In this case, the main solution is to accumulate energy on a storage element, and when enough energy is stored, the sensor node is instantaneously activated using an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. During this short time burst, the sensor performs the required acquisition, transmits the results, and enters a sleep mode until again enough energy is collected. The quiescent current of the UVLO is the main factor that determines the minimum power level at which the sensor node is still operational. Most wake-up circuits used in conventional devices suffer from a quiescent current of a few hundred nanoamperes. In this article, using a zero-bias-current MOSFET-based approach, a new wake-up circuitry is presented, which lowers the quiescent current down to the picoampere range. As a practical application, the effectiveness of the proposed circuit is shown in the soil moisture monitoring sensor setup.},

Similar to the classical EBCM, we expand the fields in terms of Floquet modes and match the extended boundary conditions at test surfaces away from the actual rough surface to retrieve the surface currents and therefore the scattered fields. However, to solve long-standing stability problems of the classical EBCM, we introduce a z-coordinate transformation to restrict and control the test surface locations explicitly. We also introduce the concepts of moderated test surface locations and balanced k-charts for further stabilization and optimization of the solutions. The computational efficiency is optimized by judicious submatrix decomposition. The resulting bistatic scattering cross sections are validated by comparing with analytical and numerical solutions. Specifically, the solutions are compared with those from the small perturbation method and small-slope approximation within their validity region, and with those from the method of moments outside the validity domains of analytical solutions. It is shown that SEBCM gives accurate, numerically efficient, full-wave solutions over a large range of surface roughnesses and medium losses, which are far beyond the validity range of analytical methods. These properties are expected to make SEBCM a competitive forward solver for soil moisture retrieval from radar measurements.},

	abstract = {Improving the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) is a challenging and popular topic. Quantifying the uncertainty in the SM inversion process and enhancing the confidence of SM retrieval are promising ways to address this challenge but have received little attention. We present a Bayesian probabilistic inversion algorithm that can simultaneously retrieve SM, surface roughness, and vegetation optical depth and quantify the uncertainty in the inversion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using airborne polarimetric L-band multibeam radiometer (PLMR) observations. We use three combinations, 3-angular observations at V-polarization (3CV), 3-angular observations at H-polarization (3CH), and 6-channel observations (6CA), to identify the optimal configuration for SM retrieval by taking advantage of PLMR’s dual-polarization and multiple angles. Uncertainties are quantified by introducing multiple uncertainty quantification metrics into Bayesian posterior distributions of SM retrievals. The estimates are validated against multiscale ground-based measurements, including manual measurements and wireless sensor network (WSN) measurements, and the spatial representativeness of the ground-based reference regarding the validation of pixel-scale SM retrievals is discussed. The 6CA attempt yields the best SM estimates (correlation coefficient (R)  \${\textbackslash}ge0.864\$ , root mean square error (RMSE)  \${\textbackslash}le0.04{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ , and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE)  \${\textbackslash}le0.035{\textasciitilde}{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$ ), while the 3CH attempt yields the lowest uncertainty. In addition, dense manual measurements are more representative than sparsely distributed WSN measurements. Overall, combining dual-polarized observations yields the best SM estimates but introduces additional uncertainty. This study highlights uncertainties quantification in SM inversion and thus provides confidence in SM inversion, facilitating improved SM retrieval algorithms.},

Many different TDR-based approaches are currently available for deriving moisture content: empirical calibration curve, empirical dielectric models, frequency-dependent dielectric mixing models, etc. Generally, TDR soil moisture measurements resort to multiple-rod probes, which provide good adhesion to the soil and ease of insertion. However, the typical configuration of such probes does not allow performing a short-open-load (SOL) calibration procedure, which is definitely necessary for retrieving accurate dielectric characterization from TDR waveforms. To overcome the impracticability of the traditional SOL calibration, in this paper, an innovative triple-short calibration (TSC) procedure for commercially available three-rod probes is proposed. First, the robustness of the TSC procedure is validated on well-referenced liquids, demonstrating that its application to TDR measurements leads to a substantial enhancement of the final accuracy in the evaluation of the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient. Successively, the TSC procedure is applied to TDR measurements performed on moistened sand samples. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed TSC method, applied to traditional TDR measurements in combination with a dielectric mixing model, leads to an accurate and effective moisture evaluation procedure. This goal is reached through an efficient optimization algorithm that minimizes the difference between experimental and theoretical reflection coefficients. Results show that the proposed strategy is a suitable candidate for low-cost, highly accurate, and easy-to-perform moisture content estimation of soils.},

Since it is not practical to provide global maps using ground measurements, land surface soil moisture remote sensing has been a hot research topic in the last several decades. As a result, a number of soil moisture products have been produced from different satellite sensors with different spatial and temporal coverage and quality. To make effective use of all available soil moisture products, a Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) has been developed at National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to produce a one-stop shop for all operational soil moisture products from different satellite sensors. To increase the spatial and temporal coverage of soil moisture product, SMOPS also provides a data layer that merges soil moisture retrievals from multiple satellites in addition to the individual soil moisture retrievals from each of the available satellites. This paper gives an overall introduction of SMOPS and its validations using ground measurements.},

	abstract = {Improving numerical weather prediction was one of the main justifications for National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) Mission. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been extensively applied to assimilate the SM observations into numerical weather predication models. Implementation of EnKF requires the observations and model simulations to be Gaussian distributed and not biased from each other. In this letter, we tested the impacts of three bias-correction methods on effectiveness of assimilating SMAP retrievals into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (GFS). They are: 1) global cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching with only one CDF for all grids and time series; 2) monthly CDF matching with one CDF for each grid; 3) the linear transformation technique that matches monthly mean and standard deviation of the SMAP retrievals and model simulations for each grid; and 4) assimilating SMAP SM data into GFS without any bias-correction procedure. With respect to the global land data assimilation (DA) system precipitation product, the results demonstrate that the effectiveness of assimilating SMAP retrievals into GFS is significantly impacted by the bias-correction methods. Relative to other DA cases, the monthly CDF matching produces the best precipitation forecast performance. Improvements of the three-hourly GFS precipitation prediction with SMAP assimilation using the monthly CDF matching can reach to 8\% and 10\% in sparsely and densely vegetated areas, respectively, and marginally positive in medium vegetation areas. Based on these results, assimilating SMAP retrievals into the GFS with the EnKF algorithm using the monthly CDF matching method is suggested for enhancing accuracy of the precipitation forecasts.},

Low to high end irrigation systems requires electricity to increase its efficiency. Irrigation systems usually obtain their source of water deep underground or to rivers nearby.

An Irrigation System Automated by using sensors and automated valve is designed so that there is a control in irrigation, which also reduce the system's power consumption. The use of sensors for the moisture and temperature of the soil is used to determine when to trigger the irrigation. Another parameter, which is the soil infiltration rate, is determined to control the flow rate of the irrigator depending on the current infiltration rate of the soil. An improvised automated infiltrometer is created, tested, and used for the actual irrigation. Results showed reduced overall power consumption.},

	abstract = {The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Production Assessment Division (IPAD) is responsible for providing monthly global crop estimates that heavily influence global commodity market access. These estimates are derived from a merging of many data sources including satellite and ground observations, and more than 20 years of climatology and crop behavior data over key agricultural areas. The goal of IPAD is to provide timely and accurate estimates of global crop conditions for use in up-to-date commodity intelligence reports. A crucial requirement of these global crop yield forecasts is the regional characterization of surface and sub-surface soil moisture. However, due to the spatial heterogeneity and dynamic nature of precipitation events and soil wetness, accurate estimation of regional land surface-atmosphere interactions based sparse ground measurements is difficult. Temporal resolution is particularly important for predicting adequate surface wetting and drying between precipitation events and is closely integrated with CADRE. We attempt to improve upon the existing system by applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA soil moisture model. The improved temporal resolution and spatial coverage of the satellite-based EOS Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) is envisaged to provide a better characterization of root zone soil moisture at the regional scale and enable more accurate crop monitoring in key agricultural areas This work aims at evaluating the utility of merging satellite-retrieved soil moisture estimates with the IPAD two-layer soil moisture model used within the DBMS. We present a quantitative analysis of the assimilated soil moisture product over West Africa (9?N-20?N; 20?W-20?E). This region contains many key agricultural areas and has a high agro-meteorological gradient from desert and semi-arid vegetation in the North, to grassland, trees and crops in the South, thus providing an ideal location for evaluating the assimilated soil moisture product over multiple land cover types and conditions. A data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely-sensed soil moisture by comparing assimilated soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.},

	abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture is a major interest for several practical applications, and this task can be suitably performed through various methods. Although extensive literature deals with the adoptions of standard systems (many of which are commercially available), the state of the art is lacking in a rigorous validation of specific systems, such as those based on the seismic wave propagation (SWP) method. Such methods have attracted a growing interest thanks to the simultaneous combination of reliability, ease of use, low cost and, most importantly, customization possibility. In this regard, in this paper the Authors propose an experimental comparative approach for fully validating a SWP-based system through reference time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. To this purpose, reference TDR measurements are performed for different moisture levels, and the corresponding reference propagation velocities are compared with those directly measured through the SWP-based system. This approach provides a comprehensive assessment of the SWP-based method, from both an experimental and a metrological point of view. The ultimate goal is to provide an exhaustive performance characterization of the system, in view of practical implementation for soil moisture evaluation.},

The system optimizes irrigation by automatically activating and deactivating the water pump when soil moisture is below the minimum and above the maximum thresholds, respectively.

	abstract = {An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) for the Aquarius/SAC-D mission has been developed for assessing the accuracy of soil moisture retrieval from passive and active L band. So far, this OSSE has been successfully exploited to study the artifacts in the retrieved soil moisture associated to: (1) uncertainties and aggregation of the ancillary parameters needed for the retrieval and (2) instrumental noise effects. However, effects due to forward and retrieval model incompatibilities have not yet been studied. In this paper, OSSE attempts to capture the influence of this effect over estimated soil moisture. The emissivity of real surfaces is very complex and is strongly dependent on land cover type and condition. In particular, surface covered by average to dense vegetation presents complex scattering properties, heavily related to canopy structure. The OSSE implements a forward model using a theoretical approach based on the electromagnetic modeling of vegetation elements and high order radiative transfer theory. In this way, the difficulties related to retrieving soil moisture from passive data with a simple model are studied. The accuracy of the soil moisture estimation is analyzed on a set of selected footprints in order to illustrate the impact of discrepancies between both models. In general, retrieved soil moisture performs worse over dense vegetated areas and under wet conditions. Furthermore, accuracy is highly dependent on land cover.},

	abstract = {The CATDS Centre (Centre Aval de Traitement des Données) recently released global daily gridded surface soil moisture (SSM) products derived from the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite brightness temperatures observations, the so called SMOS level 3 SSM datasets. To further improve the Level-3 retrieval algorithm, evaluation of the accuracy of the spatio-temporal variability of the SMOS Level 3 products (SMOSL3) is necessary. For this purpose, a comparative analysis of SMOS Level 3 ascending (SMOSL3-ASC) and descending (SMOSL3-DES) with a SSM product derived from the observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) computed by implementing the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm, referred to as AMSR-LPRM, was conducted. The comparison of both products was made against SM-DAS-2 SSM products produced at ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) during the 03/2010–09/2011 period at the global scale. Global maps of correlation coefficient (R) were computed and averaged as a function of biome types. We found that SMOSL3 (ASC and DES) and AMSR-E are capable of reproducing the temporal dynamics of the SM-DAS-2 SSM products over most of the globe. The SMOSL3-ASC product performed better than the descending one but both were found to better capture the SSM temporal dynamics in highly vegetated biomes (“Tropical humid”, “Temperate Humid”, etc.) than AMSR-LPRM. AMSR-LPRM was more capable of capturing the temporal dynamics over arid (“Desert temperate” and “Desert tropical”) biomes. Finally, we show that the accuracy of the remotely sensed SSM products is strongly related to leaf area index (LAI). Both the SMOSL3 and AMSR-LPRM (slightly better) SSM products correlate best with the SM-DAS-2 products over biomes with an average value of LAI of ∼ 1.86.},

However, the trapezoid method is a linear empirical model highly related to the retrieval accuracy of the surface temperature.

The improved method is integrated with the “trapezoid” model and multiple learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Meanwhile, RF and XGBoost were both trained with SM target data (the scale of SM and soil temperature) derived from the Tibetan Plateau observations, and the input variables were derived from MODIS observations.

This method uses the correlation between the thermal conductivity of soil and the moisture content, and indirectly identifies the moisture content by monitoring the cooling law of the PHS in soil, which can eliminate the influence of heat source intensity. Based on this idea, a mobile PHS system for soil moisture monitoring composed of a sensing-heating system and a monitoring tube was designed, which can solve the spatial resolution problem of fiber Bragg grating measurement system. Firstly, the system was used to carry out calibration tests on two different graded soil specimens with uniform moisture content. According to the cooling law of the heat source in porous medium, the discriminant index η of moisture content was defined, and then the relationship between the volumetric water content θ and η was established. Then the tests were carried out in the soil specimens with non-uniform moisture content, and a calibration relation established by the calibration tests was used to invert θ. The results were compared with those measured by drying method, thus verifying the feasibility of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Time-series monitoring of relative surface soil moisture (RSSM) with remote sensing observation is crucial for guiding agricultural irrigation management and monitoring global climate change. However, existing SAR soil moisture retrieval algorithms suffer from insufficient decoupling of surface scattering characteristics and poor RSSM time-series monitoring capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated time-series relative soil moisture monitoring method based on a SAR backscattering model (SBM). Initially, the SBM is introduced, categorizing land cover into built-up areas, water bodies, vegetation-covered areas, and soil. Addressing the inconsistency in spatiotemporal resolution between optical vegetation indices and SAR data, we establish a unique SAR water cloud model (SWCM) in conjunction with the dual-polarization SAR vegetation index (DRVIs). By employing the SWCM to eliminate vegetation's influence, a high-quality soil backscatter coefficient is obtained. Ultimately, the dry and wet reference values of soil backscatter are calculated to retrieve the relative RSSM time series. Based on Sentinel-1 data, we select three representative experimental areas, namely the Qarhan Salt Lake in dry regions, the Tibetan Plateau Naqu in high-cold regions, and Inner Mongolia Xilinhot in grassland regions, conducting RSSM spatiotemporal monitoring for three years. Experimental results demonstrate that the RSSM exhibits seasonal variations in these three regions. The correlation coefficient between the RSSM monitoring results and the in-situ data exceeds 0.64, with a maximum of 0.84. Consequently, the proposed method underscores the advantages of simplicity in parameters, high estimation precision, and robust adaptability, thereby augmenting the potential for large-scale global monitoring applications.},

	abstract = {Rice yields are highly dependent on the level of soil fertility in agricultural areas. This condition is also supported because there are no pests that attack rice plants. In addition, the level of soil fertility determines the amount of rice yields for farmers. The level of soil fertility is influenced by several factors such as soil pH level, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Weather that often changes can cause the level of soil fertility to also fluctuate. The level of soil fertility can be better or worse than the previous condition. Excessive solar heat can cause the soil to dry out and the soil temperature to increase so that the level of soil fertility decreases. When it rains, the soil moisture level increases, the soil temperature decreases, and the soil pH decreases. Therefore, we need a device that can monitor the level of soil fertility online and based on the Internet of Things (IoT) during real time weather conditions. The device is equipped with a pH sensor, temperature sensor, and soil moisture sensor. The sensors are connected to a microprocessor to process the measurement data. In the process of sending data, additional equipment is needed to connect the microcontroller to the internet network, so that the data that has been processed by the microprocessor can be sent to the smartphone. The smartphone displays information about the level of soil fertility, soil temperature, soil pH, and soil moisture levels in real time. The online monitoring device has been successfully tested and can help farmers to find out the real-time condition of their agricultural land accurately and quickly.},

The system was mounted on a 25 m manlift with capabilities of antenna positioning for multi-angle data acquisition and ranging. The RF subsystem of UF-LARS was based upon the established designs for ground-based scatterometers employing a vector network analyzer with simultaneous acquisition of V- and H-polarized returns. System integration and automated data acquisition were enabled using a software control system. Fifteen-minute observations of {\textbackslash}mmb σ0 collected over a growing season of sweet-corn and bare soil conditions in North Central Florida, were used to study the sensitivity of {\textbackslash}mmbσ0 to growing vegetation and near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture ({\textbackslash}mmbSM0 - 5). On average, {\textbackslash}mmb σ{\textbackslash}mmbVV0 were observed to be 23\% higher than {\textbackslash}mmbσ{\textbackslash}mmbHH0 during the mid- and late-stages of crop growth due to the vertical structure of stems.

The spectral reflectance, the first derivative of the reflectance, and the reciprocal logarithm of the reflectance are analyzed based on the 800 field soil samples and their hyperspectral data collected. The first derivative of the reciprocal logarithm of the reflectance and the sensitive band was extracted using the correlation coefficient method, and the correlation of the content of soil organic matter, phosphorus, and potassium was solved. The BA is used to optimize the two core parameters of the AdaBoost model (i.e., the maximum number of iterations  \$(n)\$  and the weight reduction coefficient  \$(v)\$  of the weak learner), the classification and regression trees(CART) decision tree is selected as the weak regression learner of the model, and the coefficient of determination is used as parameter optimization. Based on the objective function value, a BA-AdaBoost model was constructed to estimate soil organic matter and phosphorus and potassium contents. The results show that the BA-AdaBoost combined model can better search for globally optimal parameters. The AdaBoost model optimized by BA significantly improved accuracy and reliability. Among the three elements, soil organic matter estimation accuracy is the highest, and the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error are 0.867 and 0.151g  \${\textbackslash}cdot \$  kg−1, respectively. Compared with the model before optimization, the model accuracy and reliability improved by 29.0\% and 24.1\%, respectively. The results indicate that hyperspectral technology combined with the BA-AdaBoost model has certain application prospects in field soil nutrient estimation.},

The primary purpose of this paper is to find an alternative well-established SML-based method to estimate bulk soil moisture directly from the cosmic ray sensors that would effectively replace the current calibration equations. The second aspect of this paper is to find an alternative method to replace the cosmic ray sensor's current expensive and time-consuming field soil sample collection protocol. Data collected over 350 consecutive days from Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) database and Hydroinnova CRS-1000 cosmic ray soil moisture probe deployed in Tullochgorum, Tasmania are used in this paper. Prediction performances of the four supervised estimators, such as sugano type adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (S-ANFIS), multilayer perceptron network, probabilistic neural network, and radial basis function network are evaluated using training and testing paradigms. The best result indicates that S-ANFIS is able to match the results achieved using existing calibration equations with a 87\% accuracy. Secondly, AWAP data trained S-ANFIS is able to predict bulk soil moisture directly from cosmic ray neutron counts with a 92\% accuracy without using any collected field sample-based measurements. Finally, a novel method is also developed to produce an estimated area average bulk soil moisture grid surface map based on multiple ANFIS and cubic grid surface interpolation.},

In this research, a design and simulation of an embedded machine learning based system to predict the best crop to grow with minimal use of fertilizers with an aim of conserving the environment is presented. The system senses different real time soil parameters on a daily basis, integrates them with forecast weather information and uses embedded machine learning technique to determine which crop would grow best under the existing soil conditions so as to minimize fertilizer use. In addition to crop prediction, the system helps farmers to monitor the soil nutrients evolution so that action can be done on real time. The results are either displayed on the device or sent to the farmer\&\#x2019;s mobile phone. This is a move from the existing solutions that depend on cloud analytics and do not consider the change of soil conditions on time in making the predictions and decisions since this is expensive when done at the cloud.

We present simulated and experimental study in order to assess the effect of salinity on the complex permittivity of geological materials and, therefore, on the radar backscattering coefficient in the [1–7 GHz] frequency range. Laboratory measurements are performed on sand/sodium chloride aqueous mixtures using a vectorial network analyzer coupled to an open-ended coaxial dielectric probe. We aim at calibrating and validating semiempirical dielectric mixing models. In particular, we evaluated the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity on the microwave frequency, water content, and salinity. Our results confirm that if the real part is mainly affected by the moisture content, the imaginary part is more sensitive to salinity. In addition to the classic formulas of mixing models, the ionic-conductivity losses, which are due to mobile ions in the saline solution, are taken into account in order to better assess the effect of salinity on the dielectric properties of mixtures. Dielectric mixing models are then used as input parameters for the simulation of the radar backscattering coefficients by means of an analytical model: the integral equation model. Simulation results show that salinity should have a significant impact on the radar backscattering recorded in synthetic aperture radar data in terms of the magnitude of the backscattering coefficient. Moreover, our results suggest that VV polarization provides a greater sensitivity to salinity than HH polarization.},

	abstract = {A new physically based disaggregation method is developed to improve the spatial resolution of the surface soil moisture extracted from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data. The approach combines the 40-km resolution SMOS multiangular brightness temperatures and 1-km resolution auxiliary data composed of visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared remote sensing data and all the surface variables involved in the modeling of land surface-atmosphere interaction available at this scale (soil texture, atmospheric forcing, etc.). The method successively estimates a relative spatial distribution of soil moisture with fine-scale auxiliary data, and normalizes this distribution at SMOS resolution with SMOS data. The main assumption relies on the relationship between the radiometric soil temperature inverted from the thermal infrared and the microwave soil moisture. Based on synthetic data generated with a land surface model, it is shown that the radiometric soil temperature can be used as a tracer of the spatial variability of the 0-5 cm soil moisture. A sensitivity analysis shows that the algorithm remains stable for big uncertainties in auxiliary data and that the uncertainty in SMOS observation seems to be the limiting factor. Finally, a simple application to the SGP97/AVHRR data illustrates the usefulness of the approach.},

	abstract = {The interference pattern technique (IPT) consists of the coherent addition of the direct and reflected global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) signals in the receiving antenna. The detected power oscillates (fading), and the amplitude of these oscillations is very sensitive to the soil reflection coefficient at the specular reflection point. Therefore, variations of the reflection coefficient can be mapped, and thus dielectric constant variations, from which soil moisture can be retrieved. This work extends the use of the IPT technique from vertical polarization (V-Pol) to horizontal polarization (H-Pol). Moreover, the IPT equations are reformulated to facilitate the combination of dual-polarization retrievals. Simulations of the interference patterns at V- and H-Pol are presented for different soil moisture conditions. An upgrade of the SMIGOL GNSS-R instrument for dual-polarization observations is presented. This instrument was deployed in a flat, dry grassland in Yanco, Australia, in order to validate the proposed concepts. Finally, a comparison between the data retrieved from the SMIGOL instrument and the ground-truth soil moisture data is presented showing a good agreement between them and rainfall information.},

An approach for deriving volumetric soil moisture using satellite passive microwave radiometry from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was developed in this study. Unlike the major AMSR-E retrieval algorithms that assume fixed scattering albedo values over the globe, the proposed algorithm adopts a weighted averaging strategy for soil moisture estimation based on a dynamic selection of albedo values that are empirically determined. The resulting soil moisture retrievals demonstrate more realistic global patterns and seasonal dynamics relative to the baseline University of Montana soil moisture product. Quantitative analysis of the new approach against in situ soil moisture measurements over four study regions also indicates improvements over the baseline algorithm, with coefficients of determination (R2) between the retrievals and in situ measurements increasing by approximately 16.9\% and 41.5\% and bias-corrected root-mean-square errors decreasing by about 25.0\% and 38.2\% for ascending and descending orbital data records, respectively. The resulting algorithm is readily applied to similar microwave sensors, including the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, and its retrieval strategy is also applicable to other passive microwave sensors, including lower frequency (L-band) observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive mission.},

The novelties of the paper are: the extension of an already developed method to coarse resolution data (150 m) in mountain environment with high land heterogeneity, with only VV polarization and the proper selection of input features. During the result analysis, several algorithm characteristics were clearly identified: 1) the performances showed to be strongly related to input features such as topography and vegetation indices; 2) the algorithm needs a training phase; 3) the averaging window needs to be proper selected to take into account both the speckle noise and the characteristics of the area under investigation; and 4) the algorithm, being data driven, can be considered as site dependent. The experimental analysis is carried out on images acquired over the Südtirol/Alto Adige Province in Italy during 2010-2011 from the RADARSAT2 and Envisat ASAR in Wide Swath mode. SMC maps were compared with spatially distributed ground measurements, resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) value ranging from 0.045 to 0.07 m3/m3. Concerning the multiscale analysis, the results indicated that RADARSAT2 maps are able to detect the spatial heterogeneity and soil moisture dynamics at local scale, while ASAR WS SMC maps are able to identify mainly the two main classes of pasture and meadows. When these estimates are compared with SMC values from meteorological stations a RMSE value of 0.10 m3/m3 for both satellites indicated a reduced capability to follow the temporal dynamics.},

In this paper, a hybrid analytical/numerical solution to two-dimensional scattering from multilayer rough surfaces separated by arbitrary dielectric profiles based on the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and scattering matrix technique is presented. The reflection and transmission matrices of rough interfaces are constructed using EBCM. The dielectric profiles are modeled as stacks of piecewise homogeneous dielectric thin layers, whose scattering matrices are computed by recursively cascading reflection and transmission matrices of individual dielectric interfaces. The interactions between the rough interfaces and stratified dielectric profiles are taken into account by applying the generalized scattering matrix technique. The scattering coefficients are obtained by combining the powers computed from the resulting Floquet modes of the overall system. The bistatic scattering coefficients are validated against existing analytical and numerical solutions. Field-collected soil moisture data are then used for numerical simulations to investigate the penetration capability at different frequencies and to address the potential of low-frequency radar systems in estimating deep soil moisture. In particular, soil moisture profiles during dry ground, wet ground, and wet subsurface layer conditions are examined. The results show that both backscattering coefficients and copolarized phase difference at low frequencies are sensitive to the roughness of subsurface interfaces and deep soil moisture. Also, much larger depth sensitivity can be achieved using copolarized phase difference than scattering coefficients},

It included a transformation function that related auxiliary remotely sensed (RS) products at high resolution to in situ SM observations to obtain first estimates of SM at 1 km and merging this estimate with SM at coarse resolutions through Principle of Relevant Information (PRI). The PRI-based estimates were evaluated using synthetic observations in NC Florida for heterogeneous agricultural land covers (LC), with two growing seasons of sweet corn and one of cotton, annually. The cumulative density function showed an overall error in SM of {\textless}; 0.03 cubic meter/cubic meter in the region, with a confidence interval of 95\% during the simulation period. The PRI estimates at 1 km were also compared with those from the method based upon Universal Triangle (UT). The spatially averaged root mean square error (RMSE) aggregated over the vegetative LC were 0.01 cubic meter/cubic meter and 0.15 cubic meter/cubic meter using the PRI and UT methods, respectively. The RMSE for downscaled estimates using the UT method increased to 0.28 cubic meter/cubic meter when Laplacian errors are used, while the corresponding RMSE for the PRI remains the same for both Laplacian or Gaussian errors. The Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD) for estimates using PRI is about 50\% lower than those using the method based upon UT indicating that the probability density function (PDF) of the PRI estimate is closer to PDF of the true SM, than the UT method.},

We propose to address this task in the framework of the multi-objective optimization. A multi-objective function is defined based on a set of two (or more) metrics (e.g., mean squared error MSE and determination coefficient R2 ) that quantify from different (and sometimes competing) perspectives the goodness of a given parameter configuration. Then the metrics are jointly optimized according to the concept of Pareto optimality. This allows preserving the meaning of each metric and deriving multiple optimal solutions to the tuning problem. Each solution leads to a different optimal trade-off among the considered metrics. The main advantages of the proposed multi-objective parameter optimization approach with respect to traditional mono-objective strategies are: (1) the intrinsic improved robustness and efficiency, since multiple metrics are jointly exploited in the tuning of the free parameters of the considered regression method; and (2) the possibility to select the parameter configuration that leads to the desired trade-off among different criteria and thus best meets both the application constraints and the requirements of the specific estimation problem. The experimental analysis was focused on the challenging application domain of soil moisture retrieval from microwave remotely sensed data. The results obtained on data sets associated with two different operative conditions are very promising and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with more traditional tuning strategies based on a single metric and its usefulness in defining estimation systems for real application domains.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important component of natural water cycles and plays a crucial role for the healthy development of ecological environment in arid and semiarid areas. Microwave remote sensing techniques are promising to rapidly monitor regional soil moisture. However, major difficulties associated with retrieving soil moisture via microwave remote sensing are attributed to effects of surface roughness and vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potentials of combined roughness parameters and develop a model that mostly relies on the satellite data and requires minimum a priori information for soil moisture inversion over sparse vegetation covered areas through combing Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GF-1 data. For the purpose, the impacts of vegetation on the radar backscattering coefficient were removed by the water-cloud model (WCM) and a new roughness parameter Zs (Zs = S3/L is defined as a combined roughness parameter) was proposed by simulating relationships between surface roughness parameters, soil moisture, and backscattering coefficients using advanced integral equation model (AIEM). On the basis, a coupling model of soil moisture inversion for blown-wind areas of the Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, China, was in turn developed with Radarsat-2 HH and VV polarization data, and the soil moisture content (SMC) values for sparse vegetation covered surfaces were retrieved with limited use of in situ roughness parameters. The in situ measurements and satellite data set were used to validate the reliability of the developed model. The results showed that the retrieved soil moisture levels fell below in situ soil moisture levels before the vegetation effect was removed, and the precision of retrieved soil moisture was effectively improved when the vegetation effect was corrected by the WCM, with the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error decreasing from 7.45\% and 6.24\% to 5.12\% and 3.44\%, respectively. According to the map of retrieved soil moisture levels generated for the study area, most of SMCs were below 35\% in accordance with field observations. These study results can serve as a foundation for monitoring soil moisture and water environments in arid and semiarid regions.},

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays significant roles in various scientific fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and ecology. However, the spatial resolutions of microwave SSM products are too coarse for regional applications. Most current optical/thermal infrared SSM retrieval models cannot directly estimate the quantitative volumetric soil water content without establishing empirical relationships between ground-based SSM measurements and satellite-derived proxies of SSM. Therefore, in this paper, SSM is estimated directly from 5-km-resolution Chinese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite FY-2E data based on an elliptical-new SSM retrieval model developed from the synergistic use of diurnal cycles of land surface temperature (LST) and net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR). The elliptical-original model was constructed for bare soil and did not consider the impacts of different fractional vegetation cover (FVC) conditions. To optimize the elliptical-original model for regional-scale SSM estimates, it is improved in this paper by considering the influence of FVC, which is based on a dimidiate pixel model and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index product. A preliminary validation of the model is conducted based on ground measurements from the counties of Maqu, Luqu, and Ruoergai in the source area of the Yellow River. A correlation coefficient (R) of 0.620, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.146 m3/m3, and a bias of 0.038 m3/m3 were obtained when comparing the in situ measurements with the FY-2E-derived SSM using the elliptical-original model. In contrast, the FY-2E-derived SSM using the elliptical-new model exhibited greater consistency with the ground measurements, as evidenced by an R of 0.845, an RMSE of 0.064 m3/m3, and a bias of 0.017 m3/m3. To provide accurate SSM estimates, high-accuracy FVC, LST, and NSSR data are required. To complement the point-scale validation conducted here, cross-comparisons with other existing SSM products will be conducted in the future studies.},

With this aim, a new “bottom-up” validation approach is proposed based on the synergistic use of in situ SSM measurements from the soil moisture measurement station network (REMEDHUS) of the University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, and optical/thermal infrared observations over 18 cloud-free days from Landsat-8. An SSM estimation method using the boundary information from the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index triangle space was developed for regional SSM mapping. The retrieved SSM reached a relatively good performance (mean R2 and rootmean-squared error of 0.64 and 0.033 m3/m3, respectively). Then, the regional SSM was aggregated into the grid-cell scale of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3 high-resolution (0.1° /10 km) soil moisture product to validate it both at network and grid-cell levels. At the network level, the derived regional SSM showed a good agreement with the averaged in situ measurements over the network (R = 0.731). However, at the grid-cell level, small variations were observed for the cells over the network between the estimates and the AMSR2 product, with negative biases (-0.044 to -0.090 m3/m3) and positive correlations (R {\textgreater} 0.25) for most cells. In addition, it is shown that the descending product has a slightly better performance than does the ascending one. The preliminary assessments suggested that the proposed method provides new insights into the validation of passive microwave soil moisture products, while avoiding the common issue related to the big disparity in spatial scales between satellite observation and in situ measurements.},

However, research efforts on mine detection have generally emphasized sensor development, while less effort has been made to evaluate the effects of the environmental conditions in which the mines are placed. If the processes governing moisture and temperature distribution near the ground surface can be captured, sensor development and deployment can be more realistically tailored to particular operational scenarios and technologies. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the soil environment on landmine detection by studying the influence of the thermal boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface and the buried objects themselves on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture around shallow-buried objects. Two separate large tank experiments were performed with buried objects with different thermal properties. Experimental results were compared to results from a fully coupled heat and mass transfer numerical model. Comparison of experimental and numerical results suggests that the vapor enhancement factor used to adjust the vapor diffusive flux described based on Fick's law is not necessary under dry soil conditions. Data and simulations from this study show that the thermal signature of a buried object depends on the complex interaction among a soil's water content and its thermal and hydraulic properties. Simulated thermal and saturation contrasts were generally very different for a buried landmine than for other buried objects.},

	abstract = {In-depth study of the soil moisture mechanisms and understanding of the soil moisture transport law has an important practical significance for regional water resources management and the challenge of the water resources scarcity. Using traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring, deep soil layers can be monitored, but continuous monitoring of soil moisture at the regional level cannot be achieved. Although remote sensing simulation models can meet regional scale needs, these models are confined to the surface soil layer, and research on deep soil moisture inversion is still lacking. This paper focuses on these two issues, and investigates a remote sensing-driven soil moisture monitoring model for the Weihe River Basin. Considering water resource management needs in the Weihe River Basin, we improved the structure of the soil moisture balance model and optimized model parameters to build the remote sensing driven soil moisture balance model (RS-SWBM). Based on soil moisture modeling, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture in the Weihe River Basin was analyzed. The RS-SWBM developed for the Weihe River Basin was validated with observational data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data products. Based on the correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were all above 0.80, reflecting the effectiveness of the model. The effects of different vegetation types on soil moisture dynamics and consumption efficiency were analyzed. The results indicated that different vegetation types experienced different seasonal variations, vertical patterns, and consumption efficiencies, with strong correlations existing between these parameters and land use as well as precipitation.},

While its retrieval algorithms will correct for factors such as vegetation and surface roughness, it will not correct for soil salinity. This letter tests the assumption that soil salinity will have a negligible impact on L-band brightness temperature (Tb) at SMOS scales using field data; airborne Tb observations were collected in a saline groundwater discharge area near Nilpinna Station, South Australia. At the 500-m scale, the airborne observations of Tb could not be reproduced using the baseline algorithm of the SMOS Level 2 retrieval scheme, without accounting for soil salinity in the model. The analysis in this letter shows that soil moisture retrieval errors of at least 0.04 m3 m-3 (i.e., the entire SMOS error budget) will occur due to salinity alone in SMOS footprints with saline coverage as low as 25\% (possibly even much less). Consequently, fractional salinity coverage cannot be considered a negligible factor by microwave soil moisture satellite missions.},

Generally, these instruments must contend with the effects of vegetation growing in the soil. However, an important first step is to model the measurements made by a radiometer that is viewing bare (vegetation-free) soil. The proposed model uses a matching layer and a random depolarizer to describe bare soil surface roughness and some aspects of antenna beamwidth. The model suggests that the effects of nearsurface soil moisture and roughness upon the radiometer measurement are more distinct than is currently thought. Furthermore, it appears that both moisture and roughness can be retrieved from a single set of radiometer measurements made at orthogonal linear polarizations. This retrieval precision is predicted to be poor at soil observation angles near nadir but improves for larger angles. At observation angles near 50°, the vertically polarized radiometer measurements are predicted to be nearly insensitive to roughness. A convenient parameterization of the model is provided and permits quick implementation.},

	abstract = {Signals of opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry (SoOp-R) is a maturing field for geophysical remote sensing as evidenced by the growing number of airborne and spaceborne experiments. As this approach receives more attention, it is worth analyzing SoOp-R's capabilities to retrieve subsurface soil moisture (SM) by leveraging communication and navigation satellite transmitters. In this research, the Cramer–Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used to identify the effects of variable SoOp-R parameters on the best achievable estimation error for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). This study investigates the use of multiple frequency, polarization, and incidence angle measurement configurations on a two-layered dielectric profile. The results also detail the effects of variable SM conditions on the capability of SoOp-R systems to predict subsurface SM. The most prevalent observation is the importance of using at least two frequencies to limit uncertainties from subsurface SM estimates. If at least two frequencies are used, the CRLB of a profile is retrievable within the root-zone depending on the surface SM content as well as the number of independent measurements of the profile. For a depth of 30 cm, it is observed that a CRLB corresponding to 4\% RZSM estimation accuracy is achievable with as few as two dual-frequency-based SoOp-R measurements. For this depth, increasing number of measurements provided by polarization and incidence angle allow for sensing of increasingly wet SM profile structures. This study, overall, details a methodology by which SoOp-R receiver system can be designed to achieve a desired CRLB using a tradeoff study between the available measurements and SM profile.},

A more straightforward and consistent model of this emission results if nonuniform, rather than uniform, plane waves are used. Adaptation of this new model to a layered medium representation for the soil is improved using a normalization that is based on the isothermal soil limit. The separate concepts of radiometer sensing depth and in situ sampling depth for soil moisture are examined and theory for the sensing depth is presented. Improved approximations (at 1413 MHz) to the full model for soil emission are developed since they are needed to construct algorithms that retrieve an estimate of soil moisture from the radiometer raw measurement. The error associated with the comparison of these remotely sense values against in situ measurements is calculated. Results suggest that this comparison error could be lowered if the soil moisture sampling depth was reduced to values less than 0.01 m from the currently used values near 0.02 m, although the effect of surface roughness has not yet been analyzed.},

First, both right hand circular polarization (RHCP) and left hand circular polarization (LHCP) antennas are employed so that direct and reflected signals can be acquired simultaneously. The direction of arrival of the signals may be along the reflected signal path or even along the line-of-sight of a particular satellite. An integer ambiguity algorithm has also been implemented. The precise point positions for RHCP and LHCP antennas are enhanced and processed by repeating instantaneous ionosphere delay correct model with deriving from LI and L2 carrier phase and troposphere estimated parameter model. During the development and test stage, the digital terrain elevation data (DTED) and visual elements of the satellite's images has been used and mapped with the integrated software. For remote sensing of river, ocean, and landscape, the accuracies of each reflected altitude are among 10 cm and 30 cm. The accuracies of each reflected area are converged among 2 cm and 10 cm. Unlike most existing GPS reflection experiment, The goal of the study is to exploit the carrier phase, Doppler shift, reflectivity of L1/L2 S/N0 signal-to-noise density ratio components of the reflected signals and direct signals for stream flow, disturbed water, dry soil, and wet soil object detection. The soil moisture should be classified by volumetric content of saturated water for soil and L1/L2 reflectivity on the GPS reflected footprint. The three dimensional stream flow modeling is predicted by using Doppler shifts due to surface reflection as a moving surface on the river. Each instantaneous moving surface should be exploited by each reflected GPS carrier phase and reflected point.},

This study aims to evaluate the performance of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) in comparison to other multiple-boosting algorithms for SM prediction. Appropriate feature selection is vital for achieving accurate predictions, and this study focuses on identifying relevant features and assessing CatBoost's suitability for the task. The study incorporates several boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and CatBoost to estimate SM. Results indicate that radar backscatter coefficient, soil roughness, and digital elevation model (DEM) are crucial features for SM retrieval. Comparatively, CatBoost outperforms GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM in various feature combinations. The most favorable results are obtained when utilizing all features as inputs for the algorithm. These optimal results yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.40 vol.\%, mean relative error (MRE) of 0.16 vol.\%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.26 vol.\%, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73. Additionally, the study analyzes the inversion results for different ranges of SM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Within the range of SM from 0 to 25 vol.\% and NDVI from 0 to 0.7, utilizing all features yields the most accurate results. Using CatBoost, this approach achieves an MAE of 1.52 vol.\%, MRE of 0.12 vol.\%, RMSE of 2.11 vol.\%, and R of 0.81.

There is a demanding need for efficient irrigation and water management systems built for sustainable water utilization in smart agriculture.

Traditional electromagnetic (EM) based soil moisture sensing relies on EM based wireless sensor or ground penetrating radar (GPR) system. Based on the receiving signal strength and delay, tomographic techniques are used to derive the dielectric parameters of the soil, which are then into soil moisture distribution using empirical model. However, the EM signal attenuate sharply during underground propagation because of high operating frequency and lossy medium. In order to counter the disadvantage for underground sensing, we propose a Magnetic Induction (MI) based large range soil moisture sensing scheme in inhomogeneous environments. Here, we present the topology of the sensing system and analyze the channel model.

	abstract = {In recent times, WiFi signals have been widely used in wireless sensing applications for detecting large-scale environmental or physical characteristics, like human count and ambient temperature. Soil moisture detection using WiFi sensing is gaining interest, but the key underlying challenge is to realise contact-free sensing technology that can characterise the impact of water spreading into the soil on the Channel State Information (CSI). Therefore, we develop a framework for sensing soil water levels using CSI- based sensing. We investigate the WiFi CSI signatures pertinent to the soil water infiltration, enabling applications including soil health monitoring. In our experimental study, we use the 5GHz WiFi spectrum to implement our novel frequency-selective CSI sensing framework for soil moisture profiling using commodity Raspberry Pi devices. The experimental results verified that specific WiFi Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) subcarriers are more sensitive to the changes in soil moisture, leading to a frequency-sensitive behaviour on CSI. Our framework exploits the changes in the pressure levels due to the water movement or varying humidity levels in the soil channel between the WiFi transmitter and receiver that leave impressions on the underlying CSI. Furthermore, this paper demonstrates a novel approach by inspecting the CSI amplitude pattern of water entering the soil at a finer level. Lastly, in contrast to the existing works, our low-cost and contact-free method for detecting soil moisture detection has been empirically shown to efficiently utilise the newly-identified frequency-selective CSI signatures for the water infiltration and humidity levels in soil channel for accurate soil moisture prediction.},

Summarizing the selected studies serves to detect the relevant information that tackles the SM retrieval challenges. Thus, creating new horizons for new research. One of the main fields of interest is SM retrieval over agriculture based on the synergistic use of Sentinel-1 (S-1) and Sentinel-2 (S-2) images. High accuracy has been achieved by combining different approaches such as backscattering models and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms (e.g., AIEM and NN algorithms). The application of such a combination is highly recommended due to its promising potential.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical variable that influences various terrestrial processes and has significant implications for environmental science, land management, disaster mitigation, and civil engineering. However, current methods for soil moisture sensing often involve costly data collection procedures or high-end equipment, presenting a challenge for resource-constrained settings. This research proposes a cost-effective, accessible soil moisture sensing approach using machine learning algorithms to analyze soil images captured by a common mobile camera coupled with a high-magnification zoom lens and a FoldScope. This paper details the theory and implementation of a Support Vector Machine model for soil moisture prediction, utilizing the Scikit-Learn library for Python. We evaluated our model across three distinct soil types-loam soil, sand, and garden soil-under varying controlled moisture conditions. The results demonstrate that while the high-magnification zoom lens method achieved high accuracy across all soil types, particularly for sand, the FoldScope method, although less precise, could provide a viable, low-cost alternative for soil moisture sensing. These findings highlight the potential of machine learning and accessible imaging technologies in developing efficient, cost-effective soil moisture sensing techniques.},

	abstract = {In the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission's soil moisture retrieval algorithms, the effects of surface roughness and vegetation scattering on the brightness temperature are conventionally modeled using time-invariant parameters: roughness intensity (h) and effective scattering albedo (ω). Such simplification neglects the variability of h and ω over time, potentially compromising the accuracy of soil moisture estimates at the satellite footprint scale. This study aims to derive dynamic, pixel-scale h and ω parameters specifically for the SMAP single-channel algorithm (SCA) and the regularized dual-channel algorithm (RDCA). This is achieved through an iterative inverse procedure that minimizes the differences between the simulated brightness temperatures from spatially representative 9 km soil moisture and SMAP observations across the SMAP core validation sites. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of dynamic h and ω parameters, derived on a daily scale, markedly enhance the soil moisture retrieval performance with an average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.01 (0.02) m³/m³ and Pearson Correlation (R) of 0.95 (0.90) for the SCA (RDCA) algorithms, indicating that dynamic parameterization holds significant promise for improving retrieval accuracy. The daily scale h parameters are generally above the static values utilized in the SMAP SCA. Within the SMAP SCA framework, the accuracy of soil moisture estimates employing daily scale h and ω parameters - randomly selected from the SCA range (h∊ [0.03, 0.16], and ω∊ [0, 0.08]) – demonstrates notable stability and is comparable to the SMAP level 3 product. Furthermore, the daily scale parameters were temporally contracted to generate a monthly climatology for h and ω. While soil moisture values derived from these climatological h and ω parameters exhibit reduced absolute bias, their ubRMSE and R slightly degrade relative to SMAP level 3 product. This degradation likely suggests that the climatological parameters' gradual variations are insufficient to capture the fluctuations of those daily parameters. Moreover, the static h and ω values for the RDCA are systematically higher than those for the SCA. However, there is no consistent trend in the magnitudes of dynamic h and ω between different algorithms. Identifying the most effective dynamic h and ω parameters within the SMAP algorithmic framework necessitates not only selecting an appropriate parameter range but also accurately tracking the temporal evolutions of surface roughness and vegetation scattering. Potential applications arising from improvements in retrieved soil moisture include the management of agricultural lands and forecasts of their productivity, quantification of global water and energy fluxes at the land surface, and management of forests, particularly in instances where disturbances such as droughts, floods, or wildfire are concerned.},

However, soil moisture (SM) retrieval models constructed based on active microwave data hardly consider soil salinity. Thus, obtaining the SM datasets with various salinity on regional and local scales is difficult. This study aimed to employ theoretical model simulation to investigate the errors of SM retrieval due to not considering the impact of soil salinity. Then, three typical saline soil dielectric constant models were validated and compared based on the experimental measurement datasets. Results show that the WYR saline soil dielectric constant model has excellent performance. The soil salinity mainly affects the imaginary part of the dielectric constant and the effect of salinity on the soil dielectric constant is more significant when the SM has larger values. In addition, in retrieving SM with soil salinity more than 10 g/kg, the retrieval result of SM has an absolute error of 0.04  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$  and a relative error of 5\% when not considering the soil salinity impact.

	abstract = {Downscaling of passive microwave derived soil moisture (SM) using thermal-infrared remote sensing data is a common method to obtain higher resolution SM information. However, these thermal-based downscaling methods are limited by their requirement of daily reparameterization because thermal-infrared data are influenced by both the SM content and weather conditions. To overcome these limitations, this study developed a new method called downscaling method based on optical trapezoid model (DespiTe), which improves the spatial resolution of passive microwave derived SM products by using only optical remote sensing data. This method relies on the linear relationship between SM and the shortwave-infrared transformed (STR) reflectance, which is less affected by weather conditions. Thus, the DespiTe method needs to be parameterized only once for each area. By establishing statistical relationships between optical parameters (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and STR) and passive microwave derived SM observations, the DespiTe method enables a higher spatial resolution SM estimation to be derived. The downscaling results from DespiTe were evaluated with aircraft and in situ observed SM data acquired during the SMAPEx-4 and SMAPVEX16 field experiments. Moreover, these results were compared with those from disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DisPATCh), a commonly used thermal-based downscaling method. A comparison against aircraft SM data showed that the DespiTe method achieved an unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of 0.026 m3/m3, which outperformed the DisPATCh method that achieved a ubRMSE of 0.059 m3/m3.},

	abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) refraction pattern technique makes use of two pairs of GNSS receivers and antennas to collect the refracted signal in the medium and the direct signal in the air, respectively. Due to the sensitive response of the refracted signal to variation of the dielectric constant, the technique is suitable for measuring medium dielectric constant-related parameters such as snowpack density, vegetation water content, and soil moisture. In this article, a forward model related to the power ratio of the refracted signal to the direct one is developed to elucidate the mechanism of soil moisture-induced refracted signal strength attenuation. By making use of the simulating results derived from the model, a second-order polynomial function is established to describe the relationship between the power ratio, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Based on the function, an inversion algorithm, which takes the GNSS carrier-to-noise (C/N0) observations under high elevation angles (50°–60°) and soil temperature as the inputs, is proposed for the near-surface soil moisture estimation. The proposed algorithm is validated through a dataset collected in an experimental campaign over two years. The results demonstrate that there exists a good agreement between the proposed method-derived soil moisture estimations and ground-truth ones; and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm-derived soil moisture estimation is 0.009 cm3cm−3 when the ground-truth soil moisture is in the range from 0.150 to 0.550 cm3cm−3. Because the observations were collected by using consumer-grade GNSS chips and antennas, this study also provides a basis for the design and development of the low-cost GNSS soil moisture sensor in the future.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture sensing plays an important role in agriculture, especially in greenhouses or vertical farms. However, existing soil moisture sensing systems are either expensive and require batteries or suffer from low accuracy, preventing their real-world applications. This paper introduces SoilTAG, a battery-free, chipless tag-based high accuracy soil moisture sensing system. The key insight is that the tag's resonator can convert changes in soil moisture levels into changes in the tag's frequency response. However, two challenges need to be addressed before applying the system to the real world. First, how to design a resonator whose frequency response is sensitive to even small moisture changes, which is the basis for high-precision moisture sensing. To solve the challenge, we design a special structure (i.e., a defected ground structure) as the tag's resonator and optimize its key parameters to increase the frequency response sensitivity for different soil moisture levels. Second, how to design a robust soil moisture feature that is independent of the tag's location changes, since the frequency response varies by both the tag location and soil moisture. To deal with this challenge, we introduce a relative frequency response feature whose amplitude ratio is only related to soil moisture levels and independent of the tag location changes. Extensive experiments show that SoilTAG achieves \$90th\$90th percentile moisture sensing error of \$2{\textbackslash}\%\$2\%, \$3.64{\textbackslash}\%\$3.64\%, and \$8{\textbackslash}\%\$8\% when the distance between transmitter and tag is 6 m, 10 m, and 13.9 m.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical variable in climate forecasting, hydrology, and others. Satellite-based remote sensing techniques have been used to map soil moisture globally, including visual bands, infrared, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), passive microwave remote sensing, etc. Passive microwave remote sensing techniques, especially at the L-band, such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), have higher accuracy than the others due to their higher sensitivity to the dielectric constant of the soil profile. However, the unclear sensing depth at L-band for SMOS and SMAP leads to a mismatch in the calibration/validation and application of their soil moisture products. In this study, we apply soil temperature sensing depth model, i.e., the tau-z model, to the soil temperature, soil moisture, and brightness temperature (TB) data collected during the Soil Moisture Experiment in the Luan River (SMELR). The effectiveness of the tau-z model in interpreting the L-band microwave observations is validated through forward simulations with the Community Microwave Emission Modelling (CMEM). Results showed that: 1) the bias in TB simulation can be reduced from 26.22 K/12.00 K to -11.66 K/-8.839 K for H/V-polarization; 2) the RMSE is reduced from 30.2 K/20.48 K to 12.92 K/11.66 K for H/V-polarization by considering the microwave sensing depth. Daily TB signal variation partly attributed to the soil temperature sensing depth due to different bands' penetration capacity. The result is expected to improve the understanding of microwave data collected by muli-frequency synthetic platforms such as Copernicus Microwave Imaging Radiometer (CIMR).},

In these studies, the phase is understood to directly relate to the radial component of the physical deformation of the surface. In this paper, however, we use a novel combination of microwave and optical laboratory measurements to demonstrate the presence of persistent and coherent phase changes in a temporal sequence of DInSAR images, related solely to moisture change in a soil. This is confirmation of recent reports suggesting that, in some circumstances, the DInSAR signal may include a significant soil moisture signal. Laboratory measurements were used to obtain a set of high-resolution C-band DInSAR images of a sandy soil sample of an area of 2.0 m × 1.8 m and a depth of 0.2 m, with the fractional volumetric water content varying between 0.1 and 0.4. To independently monitor the soil surface for physical movement, a time-lapsed set of high-resolution digital optical images was continuously acquired. Although the soil underwent a large moisture change, the soil surface was static to within ±0.1 mm over the majority of the experiment. The DInSAR sequence displayed dynamic and complex variations of the phase, although a linear relationship with moisture change was evident when the mean phase change was considered. The work raises the possibility that DInSAR could be used for the monitoring of soil moisture change in a scene, a parameter of significant economic and environmental importance.},

The challenge for retrieval algorithms is to identify and isolate precipitation profiles whose simulated observations agree with the satellite observations and are also representative of the surface conditions. Microwave emissivity modeling results are presented from a physically based land algorithm that retrieves soil moisture, vegetation water content, and surface temperature, along with the emissivity using polarized 10, 18, and 37 GHz channel measurements from the WindSat sensor onboard the Coriolis satellite, and results from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI).

However, measurement errors (MEs) increase the prediction uncertainty. In this letter, an extended interpolation technique - BK with MEs (BKMEs) - is developed. The properties of BKME are proven through derivation and demonstrated in a case study of soil moisture (SM) upscaling. Three prediction scenarios - one without MEs (BK), BK with homogeneous MEs (BKHOME), and BK with heterogeneous MEs (BKHEME) - are considered for the upscaling of SM data observed by a distributed wireless sensor network, and the results are compared. Both BK and BKHOME yield the same upscaling results, which differ from those of BKHEME, and the prediction results of BKHEME show less bias than those of the other scenarios. Because both BKHOME and BKHEME consider MEs, their prediction results show smaller kriging variances than do the BK results. Three primary conclusions are drawn. The first is that the optimal kriging coefficients assigned to the observations are affected not only by spatial distance but also by the MEs when the MEs of the samples are unequal. The second is that when the MEs are equal, it may not be necessary to consider the MEs to predict the value for an unobserved location. The third is that although the prediction uncertainty can be reduced by considering MEs, it is more meaningful to consider unequal MEs than equal MEs in the prediction process. BKME is an advanced upscaling method that achieves improved prediction accuracy by considering MEs.},

	abstract = {Precision agriculture is experiencing substantial development through the improved availability of cost-effective instruments for data collection. This includes ground-based proximal sensing technologies that are able to compete with satellite and aircraft observation systems, due to low operational costs, high operational flexibility, and high spatial resolution. This article was therefore designed to compare the performance of multiple sensing systems mounted on a smart buggy platform. A number of proximal sensing technologies were then evaluated and intercompared for their accuracy in retrieving high resolution near-surface soil moisture. The sensors tested included an L-band microwave radiometer (ELBARA III), a global navigation satellite system reflectometer sensor (LARGO), and an electromagnetic induction sensor (EM38). Data were collected during the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) in Yanco, NSW, Australia, in September 2015. Observations from each sensor were converted to surface soil moisture values which were in turn evaluated against reference measurements obtained by in situ soil moisture measurements. The sensing technologies tested here have been individually assessed by many other studies, but within different regions and environments including surface condition, local weather, observing height, size of footprint, etc. Consequently, this article has used a single platform to intercompare the different sensors to be evaluated concurrently. Results from this article indicated that the L-band microwave radiometer achieved the best performance in retrieving surface soil moisture. The average RMSE and R were found to be 0.055 cm3/cm3 and 0.68 for ELBARA III, 0.084 cm3/cm3 and 0.51 for LARGO, and 0.090 cm3/cm3 and 0.32 for the EM38.},

A 10\% water savings in the Australian agriculture sector would be equivalent to a reduction of more than 30\% of the combined water consumption from Australian capital cities [3]. Further, soil moisture influences the process of rainfall being partitioned into runoff and infiltration, and saturated soil could turn heavy rain into floods.

	abstract = {Soil moisture can vary spatially at the scale of agricultural fields ({\textasciitilde}10–100 m), which is generally too fine to resolve using passive radiometric methods. Active radar provides an opportunity for finer resolution measurements; in particular, the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) closure phase parameter is sensitive to changing soil moisture. We have developed a model showing that a systematic nonzero closure phase can result from scattering from objects at different depths in a medium of time-varying dielectric, such as from changes in soil moisture. The model predicts that interference between surface and subsurface reflections is needed for the closure phase to be nonzero. We find that, under certain circumstances, we can estimate soil moisture from the closure phase using a data reduction approach that includes a cumulative sum of the closure phase over time and the removal of a trend. The correlation between the cumulative closure phase and soil moisture suggests that the closure phase is related to the change in soil moisture. We examine a large test region in Oklahoma, where the detrended cumulative closure phase from Sentinel-1 data demonstrates some agreement with in situ soil moisture measurements. In other areas, the match is weaker, implying a terrain dependence on the quality of fit. The cumulative InSAR closure phase promises to provide a valuable new method to remotely estimate soil moisture.},

Two sensing approaches are investigated, using prototype resistive sensors and a commercial capacitive sensor. The obtained results demonstrate that all the measurements are affected by the soil conductivity and thus vary in accordance with the soil type hence, for accurate measurement, the sensors must be appropriately calibrated according to the soil under test. Moreover, the resistive sensor is proved to have satisfactory sensitivity in a greater frequency range with respect to the capacitive device, and this paves the way for possible usage with low-power microcontrollers for the creation of low-cost embedded systems.},

Currently, the USDA IPAD estimates surface and root-zone soil moisture using a two-layer modified Palmer soil moisture model forced by global precipitation and temperature measurements. However, this approach suffers from well-known errors arising from uncertainty in model forcing data and highly simplified model physics. Here, we attempt to correct for these errors by designing and applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA modified Palmer soil moisture model. An assessment of soil moisture analysis products produced from this assimilation has been completed for a five-year (2002 to 2007) period over the North American continent between 23° N-50° N and 128° W-65° W. In particular, a data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely sensed soil moisture by comparing EnKF soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline Palmer model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to, e.g., farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. Here, we present a method to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites, which carry C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (CSAR) sensors that provide the richest freely available SAR data source so far, unprecedented in accuracy and coverage. Our SSM retrieval method, adapting well-established change detection algorithms, builds the first globally deployable soil moisture observation data set with 1-km resolution. This paper provides an algorithm formulation to be operated in data cube architectures and high-performance computing environments. It includes the novel dynamic Gaussian upscaling method for spatial upscaling of SAR imagery, harnessing its field-scale information and successfully mitigating effects from the SAR's high signal complexity. Also, a new regression-based approach for estimating the radar slope is defined, coping with Sentinel-1's inhomogeneity in spatial coverage. We employ the S-1 SSM algorithm on a 3-year S-1 data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters and product masks, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of therefrom generated S-1 SSM data, involving a 1-km soil water balance model over Umbria, yields high agreement over plains and agricultural areas, with low agreement over forests and strong topography. While positive biases during the growing season are detected, the excellent capability to capture small-scale soil moisture changes as from rainfall or irrigation is evident. The S-1 SSM is currently in preparation toward operational product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service.},

Early assessment of soil moisture reserves, and monitoring of changes in available soil moisture, could assist in risk reduction strategies for the agriculture sector and effective delivery of government programs. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been acquiring RADARSAT-2 data since 2008 to evaluate the accuracy with which this sensor can provide soil moisture to assist with implementing risk reduction strategies for the Canadian agriculture sector. The calibrated Integral Equation Model (IEM) was used to estimate soil moisture for 15 RADARSAT-2 data sets acquired over an eastern and western Canadian test site. Using this approach, field level soil moisture was estimated to a mean average error of 7.95\%, although considerable scatter in the results was observed. Removing fields which had significant residue cover improved site specific soil moisture errors, but only for the fall campaign prior to spring tillage and seed bed preparation. Higher errors were also observed for data sets where angles between the RADARSAT-2 look direction and field tillage structures were largest. When soil moisture estimates were evaluated at a regional scale, mean errors fell to 3.14\%. The IEM was also able to detect increases and decreases in soil moisture which followed periods of rainfall and drying.},

Considering the difficulties in modeling the complex soil-vegetation scattering mechanisms and the great need of ancillary data for microwave backscatter SM inversion, algorithms based on temporal change are currently the best method to examine SM variability. This paper evaluates the spatial sensitivity of the ASAR GM surface SM product derived using the temporal change detection methodology developed by the Vienna University of Technology. This evaluation is made for an area in southeastern Australia using data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005. The spatial evaluation is made using three different types of SM data (station, field, and airborne) across several different scales (1-25 km). Results confirmed the expected better agreement when using point (R station = 0.75) data as compared to spatial (R PLMR, 1 km = 0.4) data. While the aircraft-ASAR GM correlation values at 1-km resolution were low, they significantly improved when averaged to 5 km (R PLMR, 5 km = 0.67) or coarser. Consequently, this assessment shows the ASAR GM potential for monitoring SM when averaged to a spatial resolution of at least 5 km.},

The well-established semiempirical water cloud model is adopted to correct for the effect of vegetation on SAR data. In anticipation of the use of the algorithm in an operational system, in which the SAR-derived high resolution soil moisture product can be assimilated within weather prediction models or hydrological ones, an uncertainty index is associated to each estimate. The algorithm has been tested on a dataset consisting of ground data gathered for seven years (2003-2010) on an agricultural test site in Northern Italy and radar data provided by the C-band ENVISAT/ASAR instrument. A comparison, performed at field scale, between estimated and in situ soil moisture data has shown that, by discarding the estimates with the largest uncertainty, the correlation coefficient can exceed 0.80 and the root mean square estimation error is less than 0.05 m3/m3. Moreover, the uncertainty index has turned out to be fairly correlated to the actual estimation error.},

The average residence time of drought reflected by ESA CCI SSI from short periods of extreme drought and long periods of less extreme drought are above 1 week and 3 weeks later than that represented by SPI and SPEI.

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) information can be routinely obtained from high-quality microwave retrievals at a global scale—such as datasets generated by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. In this article, using mutual information (MI) theory, we investigate the efficacy of the downscaled SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 3-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL2) for the detection of agricultural drought over northwestern China. The SPL2 is generated by merging SMAP enhanced radiometer data with Sentinel-1 radar observations. To evaluate the efficiency of the SPL2 downscaled algorithm, the SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer 9-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL3) is also utilized as a non-downscaled baseline. Over croplands, comparing normalized MI (NMI) values sampled between the NDVI time series and 3-km Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient (σ) from SPL2 with NMI values between NDVI and SPL3 radiometer brightness temperature (Tb; resampled to 3-km resolution), we find that the Sentinel-1 σ explains more (3-km) NDVI information than the SPL3 Tb, as the NMI between σvh (σvv) and NDVI is 15\% (8\%), larger than that between SPL3 Tb and NDVI (5\%). However, compared to the SPL3 Tb baseline, the information from downscaled SPL2 Tb on NDVI is reduced by approximately 3\%, and the SPL2 algorithm extracts only 7\% (10\%) of the total information available from both enhanced SPL3 Tb and Sentinel-1 σvh (σvv). Overall, the C-band σ signal provides valuable information for vegetation monitoring due to its frequency advantage. However, additional efforts should be focused on SPL2 merging algorithms to improve the value of the downscaled SPL2 product for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {The soil moisture changes (\${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$) have a significant influence on forestry, hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and climate change. Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), as a potential remote sensing tool for change detection, was relatively less investigated for monitoring this parameter. DInSAR phase (\$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}varphi \}\}\$) is sensitive to the changes in soil moisture (\$\{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$), and thus, can be potentially used for monitoring \${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$. In this article, the relations between \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}varphi \}\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ over wheat, canola, corn, soybean, weed, peas, and bare fields were investigated using an empirical regression technique. To this end, dual-polarimetric C-band Sentinel-1A and quad-polarimetric L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) airborne datasets were employed. The regression model showed the coefficient of determination (R2) of 40\% to 56\% and RMSE of 4.3 vol.\% to 6.1 vol.\% between the measured and estimated \${\textbackslash}Delta \{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ for different crop types when the temporal baseline (\${\textbackslash}Delta \{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{T\}\}\$) was very short. As expected, higher accuracies were obtained using UAVSAR given its very short \${\textbackslash}Delta \{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{T\}\}\$ and its longer wavelength with R2 of 47\% to 59\% and RMSE of 4.1 vol.\% to 6.7 vol.\% for different crop types. However, using the Sentinel-1 data with the long \${\textbackslash}Delta \{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{T\}\}\$ and shorter wavelength (5.6 cm), the accuracies of \$\{\{{\textbackslash}bf {\textbackslash}Delta \}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ estimations decreased significantly. The results of this study demonstrated that using the \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{{\textbackslash}varphi \}\}\$ information from Sentinel-1 data is a promising approach for monitoring \$\{\{{\textbackslash}bf {\textbackslash}Delta \}\}\{\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{M\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{v\}\}\}\$ at an early growing season or before the crop starts growing, but using L-band SAR data and lower temporal baselines are recommended once the biomass increases.},

	abstract = {With growing usage and demand for the global freshwater supply, there is an increasing need for technologies that facilitate water conservation and environmental stewardship in irrigated agriculture. Toward this end, recent demonstrations of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors have revealed the value of wireless soil moisture content sensors. However, existing wireless solutions often employ above-ground wireless communication modules that physically interfere with routine farming operations. Underground wireless network solutions are severely challenged by the large radio-frequency (RF) propagation loss through soil. This paper presents a method that overcomes both problems by employing completely buried underground IoT sensors and communication modules with UAS (uncrewed aircraft system) mounted LoRaWAN gateways. The UAS mounted LoRaWAN gateway eliminates the need for any in-field base stations and also allows the LoRa enabled sensors to transmit data over short distances with very low energy. Field tests were carried out using this approach to serve as a proof of concept. The RSSI (received signal strength indicator) demonstrates that the proposed solution has good communication link margin and a significantly larger communication range than is necessary for reliable operation. Moreover, this solution is easy to build, scalable, cost-effective, and can be implemented in a highly power efficient fashion.},

	abstract = {Drought, a destructive natural disaster, poses a significant threat to vulnerable areas worldwide. Its occurrence in Taiwan brings up concerns, particularly for vital sectors, such as the high-end semiconductor chip industry. Many satellite-based indexes have been developed to monitor the drought. The temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), a commonly used drought index, uses an empirical simplification of land surface temperature (LST) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The newly developed temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) using the LST–normalized difference latent heat index (NDLI) space is regarded as an alternative to TVDI due to its improved ability in vegetation-sparse areas. This article presents advancements in the TMDI using the novel fractional surface water availability (FSWA) derived from the NDLI, with an emphasis on enhanced edge selection in the LST–FSWA trapezoidal space for observing drought states. An effective method has been used to select the dry and wet edges within this trapezoid. The ability of the indexes was evaluated using indicators, including the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL)-based crop water stress index (CWSI) and evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), and in situ precipitation. The results show high correlations (r) between the TVDI and both CWSI and ET, with r values of 0.85 and −0.83, respectively. The TMDI reveals even stronger relationships with CWSI (r = 0.93) and ET (r = −0.94) and is more sensitive than individual variables (FVC, FSWA, and LST) and TVDI. It also indicates a high correlation between the TVDI and GPP (r = −0.69), while the TMDI displays a higher correlation with GPP (r = −0.75). Based on the spatiotemporal analysis, the TMDI was spatially well-matched with CWSI and GPP across most of the study area. Compared to other indexes, the TMDI exhibits the highest sensitivity to precipitation (r = −0.60). By leveraging the CWSI classification, a new TMDI threshold is proposed to assess drought status in southwestern Taiwan during the fourth quarter of the years 2014–2021. Overall, the TMDI accurately captures spatiotemporal variations in drought status, providing valuable insights for irrigation managers to effectively manage limited water resources.},

	abstract = {The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing allows for fast and effective soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring. Scale conversion can obtain remote sensing images at multiple resolutions and offer the possibility of improving the estimation accuracy of SMC, which is crucial for precision agriculture. To explore the effect of upscaling conversion on SMC monitoring with UAV remote sensing, multispectral images and SMC data at different soil depths were acquired. The multispectral image with an original spatial resolution of 0.1 m was continuously upscaled to 6 m (with a step of 0.1 m and a total of 60 levels). The correlation coefficient method was adopted to determine the optimal scale, and spectral indices at the original and optimal scales were calculated. SMC inversion models at different depths were constructed at the original and optimal scales by multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural networks (BP), respectively. The results showed that the correlation of UAV multispectral data with SMC displayed a change in first enhancement and then fluctuating weakness with the increase of the upscaled levels. The optimal scale of UAV multispectral remote sensing for monitoring SMC at all soil depths was about 2 m. The BP models were significantly better than the MLR models. For example, in the SMC estimation at 0-20 cm, the RMSE of the BP model was reduced from 0.0110 to 0.0087 (20.9\%). This study can provide theoretical and technical references for improving the accuracy of UAV multispectral remote sensing for SMC monitoring.},

The advent of uncrewed aerial systems (UASs) has opened new opportunities for bridging this need. We offer one of the very first validation studies on a dry-down event captured by a novel L-band radiometer onboard a Black Swift Technologies fixed-wing S2 UAS. A fallow cornfield at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center was selected as a study area to validate volumetric soil moisture estimates in mid-April. By leveraging a comparable radiative transfer model to that of soil moisture active passive and soil moisture ocean salinity derived products, brightness temperature retrievals from this sensor are shown to successfully capture a week of dry-down poststorm event, as validated by HydraGO probe estimates (calibrated with gravimetric samples) and a nearby soil climate analysis network station. However, with a reported spatially averaged bias of −0.107 m3/m3 (compared to calibrated moisture values) and an ubRMSE of 0.028 m3/m3 potential concerns remain regarding the sensor calibration, vegetation and surface roughness corrections, and georeferencing. Nevertheless, given the potential of UAS for on-demand, high-resolution soil moisture retrievals, this collaborative effort provides critical feedback for informing future applications and improvements in the field of passive microwave remote sensing.},

The objective of the technology, supported by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office Advanced Information Systems Technology program, is to enable a guided and adaptive sampling strategy for the in-situ sensor network to meet the measurement validation objectives of spaceborne soil moisture sensors. A potential application for this technology is the validation of products from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission. Spatially, the total variability in soil-moisture fields comes from variability in processes on various scales. Temporally, variability is caused by external forcings, landscape heterogeneity, and antecedent conditions. Installing a dense in-situ network to sample the field continuously in time for all ranges of variability is impractical. However, a sparser but smarter network with an optimized measurement schedule can provide the validation estimates by operating in a guided fashion with guidance from its own sparse measurements. The feedback and control take place in the context of a dynamic physics-based hydrologic and sensor modeling system. The overall design of the smart sensor web-including the control architecture, physics-based hydrologic and sensor models, and actuation and communication hardware-is presented in this paper. We also present results illustrating sensor scheduling and estimation strategies as well as initial numerical and field demonstrations of the sensor web concept.

Motes perform communication and processing functions and also take measurements using limited onboard battery power. For environmental monitoring deployment, sampling rates need to be assigned to motes such that useful information can be extracted over both spatial and temporal scales. The data sampling rate, which is intimately related to data transmission rate, plays an important role in the mote's battery life. Moreover, while it has been noted that mote operation continues under less than optimal power supply levels, data collected during this time undergoes attenuation from the desired measurement. That is, low battery conditions of motes could significantly affect the accuracy of sensed data. This paper investigates the above two issues to achieve extended battery life for individual wireless motes while maintaining sampling adequacy and reliability in transmitting accurate data. We first study how different sensor characteristics, such as different types of sap flow sensors, can affect motes' sampling and transmission rate. Then, we examine the effect of sensing attenuation due to low battery power on sap flow, soil moisture, and soil water potential measurements. A simple regression model was found to correct data for both the sap flow and soil water potential sensors sampled on under-powered motes. By operating under less than optimal power levels, this effectively increases motes' battery life for reliable data collection from wireless sensor networks.},

In this method, four reconstruction rules were proposed to rebuild four kinds of corresponding missing pixels, defined as follows: C1 pixel (including one in situ sensor in its area), C2 pixel (physically similar to C1), C3 pixel (with a regular soil moisture observation sequence), and C4 pixel (remaining). By analyzing soil moisture observation relationships between these four types of pixels with in situ measurements and within these pixels, four numerical reconstruction rules were established. Linear regression, similar pixel determination, least square method, and geostatistical interpolation algorithms were used in these four rules. At last, all blank soil moisture pixels in the target soil moisture image can be filled by the SICR method. The experiment conducted in the central south of U.S. integrated 11 in situ soil moisture sensors from the United States Department of Agriculture with 11 GF-1 satellite soil moisture images. It was demonstrated that GF-1 soil moisture observations on October 17, 2014, were successfully reconstructed by the SICR method, based on the evaluations of visual appearance comparison, error distribution analysis, subimage comparison, average relative error, and universal image quality index. SICR also performed better than the reconstruction results only based on in situ or satellite sensor data. Moreover, the comparison with the soil moisture observation from the microwave sensor demonstrated the value of SICR in regional high-resolution soil moisture reconstruction. It was suggested that the SICR method provided an effective reconstruction method under full cloud contamination and showed great potential for collaborating satellite and in situ sensors.},

However, most current existing soil moisture monitoring networks have limitations due to high power consumption, complex architecture, and expensive equipment. These issues are not conducive to high-density soil moisture observation. In view of the existing problems in the current soil moisture in-situ sites, an effective resolution for high-density soil moisture observation is needed. For the first time, we are bringing Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), a low-power Internet-of-Things technology, into geospatial sensor Web for soil moisture observation. Moreover, we built a high-density in-situ soil moisture sensor Web via NB-IoT and compared it with ZigBee at the Baoxie experimental zone in Wuhan, China, there about 1 km2, and we acquired data for up to 12 months. We analyze the acquisition record of battery status, signals, and soil moisture. We analyzed the battery life, the impact of the signal on the battery performance, the signal quality, and data acquisition clearly and intuitively. This unprecedented study and application, we discovered and concluded that the low-power sensor Web of the NB-IoT communication protocol could be suitable for high-density soil moisture observation.},

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture provides 40\% of the World's food from 20\% of the agricultural land but uses 70\% of all global freshwater withdrawals. However, even supposedly efficient and well-managed irrigation systems waste up to 50\% of the water applied to the crops under them. Meeting the food needs of an increasing world population from a static or even decreasing land base will, therefore require improved efficiencies in irrigated agriculture and better use of these finite water resources. The first part of this paper reports on a field-based research project which examined a suite of conventional and alternative irrigation systems which were installed at a farm in south west Australia and assessed and compared in terms of their Water Use Efficiency. All “alternative” systems outperformed the conventional surface (flood) irrigation systems with comparative water savings of around 50\%. The second part of the paper assesses the potential Water Use Efficiency improvements at farm and system-scales which could be achieved through linking these irrigation systems to wireless soil-moisture sensor networks which are being developed by the authors and which are reported in detail in associate papers. Improving irrigation scheduling and management by better (and, where appropriate, automatic) links to near real-time soil moisture data is shown to produce water savings of up to 30 GL per year at the irrigation system scale.},

Sensors provide information that is useful in order to effectively manage and control various processes. This study presents an energy-efficient, highly reliable, ultra-high frequency (UHF) capacitive sensor that can measure moisture/humidity, and liquid levels. As a sensitive part, an interdigital capacitor (IDC) is fed via a coplanar waveguide (CPW) for efficient power transfer. Aside from the sensitive part of the IDC, the structure of the sensor is insensitive to variations in surrounding permittivity, which reduces uncertainty in results and thus improves accuracy. The principle of sensing is based on a reactive phase variation of the input signal upon reflection, whereas its amplitude and phase are actively changing with variations in the dielectric constant of the test medium. Practical testing was conducted on the sensor to determine soil moisture, air humidity, and liquid level measurement. At a fixed UHF frequency of 915 MHz the sensor offers a capacitive sensitivity of 7.5 fF/\%WC, 4.5 fF/\%RH, and 13.4 fF/mm for soil moisture, air humidity, and water level detection respectively. This new sensor provides high reliability, good sensitivity, low power consumption, and can be implemented in a number of applications, including agriculture, oil, and gas industry, land and water treatment, medical equipment, and biotechnology.},

The purpose of this paper was to determine whether the time division multiplexing (TDM) approach would effectively estimate SM content. We developed a sensor to detect SM from four soil depths (10, 20, 40, and 60 cm) simultaneously by using the TDM technique. This is a type of EM sensor that indirectly estimates the SM on the basis of the dielectric properties of soil. Three types of soil samples were used to calibrate the sensor. The calibration models were established using polynomial (3rd order) fitting equations. The performance of the sensor was evaluated both in the laboratory and in situ conditions. The sensitivity of the sensor was examined in a micro-control irrigation system. The sensor measured SM contents in a soil box were compared with HYDRUS-2D simulated wetting patterns. The results were in the optimal range, and the coefficient of determination ( \$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$ ) ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 and root means square error (RMSE) from 0.72 to 2.01. The TDM detection circuit-based sensor  \$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$  value was 0.97, and its RMSE was 2.78. Whereas the independent detection circuit  \$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$  values ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 and RMSE from 4.09 to 5.07. The results determined that the sensor could be used for continuous SM measurements, which would be advantageous for planning the irrigation practices in arid and irrigated regions.},

	abstract = {Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) have recently been investigated for a wide range of applications. One challenge in wireless underground communications is its high bit error rate, especially at long distances. In WUSNs, the communication quality is substantially affected by the environment, especially the soil moisture. Thus, the underground channel quality can be effectively estimated based on local soil moisture readings. By utilizing the local soil moisture values to estimate the channel quality, adaptive error control mechanisms can be implemented for underground nodes. In this paper, two error control mechanisms, adaptive-rate forward error control and adaptive transmit power control, are considered for WUSNs. The results indicate that compared to ARQ, adaptive FEC code can increase the ranges of soil moisture values within which the network is reliable by reducing the bit error rate. In addition, adaptive transmit power control can improve energy efficiency when a wide range of transmit power levels is available. Our evaluations show that to achieve 60m communication distance in practical soil settings, the output power of the transmitter should to be adjusted in a range of 0dBm to 25dBm to improve the energy efficiency of the underground nodes.},

Apart from this, new generation of low-cost soil moisture sensors present cost effective way of in-situ measurement of soil moisture, but suffer from inherent heterogeneity between sensing techniques, protocol variations and non-standard calibration methods. Thus, long term monitoring of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture trails requires interoperability between sensing platforms, process-based and statistical modeling and inclusion of remote sensing techniques.

Six nodes and one gateway were deployed and tested for four months, and have proven to be reliable and self-sufficient, all while continuing to transmit sensor data, which is successfully logged by the centralized gateway onto a website capable of time-based graphical analysis. The system has also shown to be easily adaptable, as changes and modifications were made to the network. In addition, the proposed system is comprehensive, cost-effective, and scalable.

This microwave resonator is constructed using two reflectors along the coaxial line. The first reflector is a metal post at the signal input end, short-circuiting the inner conductor to the outer conductor. The second reflector comprises a welded metal plate parallel to the open end of the coaxial line, maintaining a fixed gap. A moisture-sensitive polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film is inserted into this gap. The resonance frequency of the open-end coaxial cable resonator is highly dependent on the fringe capacitance, which varies with soil moisture levels. As such, tracking resonance frequency changes allows for correlation with soil moisture fluctuations. We provide a detailed discussion of the embeddable open-end microwave coaxial cable resonator (EOE-MCCR) mathematical model and a proof of concept for soil moisture measurement.

	doi = {10.1109/ISEMA49699.2021.9508292},
	abstract = {Soil sensor activated irrigation scheduling is used in agriculture to optimally dose water and improve water use efficiency. Soil moisture sensors give point-related information and due to heterogeneities in soil hydraulic properties, use of a limited number of sensors may lead to errors in the average soil moisture content obtained for a field. As prices for individual IoT-based soil moisture sensors are still high, there is a need for low-cost soil moisture sensors. The AquaTag prototype is a passive, impedance-based sensor tag and a hand-held readout device for measuring soil water content. It operates contactless using a near-field, narrow-band RF-technology at 27 MHz. The tag has a lower accuracy than regular FD or TDR sensors, but it has the potential to be produced at very low-cost. Growers with small-scale, low-tech soil-grown crop production systems could use it to save water at acceptable cost. The aim of this work was to evaluate performance of prototypes, especially for the effects of production variability, reader-sensor positioning, temperature and soil type calibration. Sensor repeatability was ±0.62\% and the overall accuracy tested with well-saturated glass beads was ±10.4\%, taking effects of functional calibration, reader positioning and temperature into account. Production variability was improved by functional testing, selection and optimizing the reader signal analysis. Measurements for dry and wet sandy soils are possible at sensor-reader distances up to 10 cm. The reader angular position influences readings only marginally, if measurements are taken with care. Soil temperature affects sensor readings considerably, but the effect of the tag temperature is only marginally. A single calibration curve for two loamy-clay sandy soils was obtained. The AquaTag seems suitable to determine soil moisture content, but in order to reach an accuracy of below ±10\%, sensors must be tuned individually, for temperature a compensation is required and in-situ calibration for well-saturated soils is advised. Sensors with a longer shaft are required to use the tag for measurements at common crop rooting depths.},

Since soil salinization affects the plant growth which affects agricultural production and food security, it needs to be monitored and managed well. The existing field devices for assessing soil salinity are expensive ({\textgreater} US\$\{{\textbackslash}\$\}\$ 150 for the sensor alone). So, a lowcost sensor (about US70) has been designed for assessing soil salinity by measuring soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC). The device uses oscillation frequency shift technique for measuring soil moisture, and electrical resistivity is used for bulk EC measurement. The sensor prototype has been designed and tested using downward infiltration method with 14 soil samples. Regression models have been developed for soil moisture estimation from frequency measurements. Pore water EC has been estimated from bulk EC measurements for determining soil salinity. The regression models developed for soil moisture estimation from frequency has R2 ranging from 0.92 - 0.95, which is significant for accepting the models. The bulk EC measurements were transformed to pore water EC, and a threshold regression model has been developed from for determining soil salinity at different moisture levels. The threshold pore water EC regression model has an R2 of 0.74, which is acceptable for determining salinity from pore water EC values.},

The present challenge with this design is to achieve both penetration depth and sensitivity simultaneously. In this work, keeping the electrode contour area fixed, multi-frame ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensors are proposed and designed to enhance sensitivity and penetration depth, simultaneously. A theoretical model for capacitance is extended to a multi-frame configuration. The estimated capacitance from this extended theoretical model is compared against simulation results and found to be well-correlated. Multi-frame ID-FF configurations with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 frames are used to develop single-sided (s-s) and dual-sided (d-s) ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensor models. Simulation results show an increase in the sensitivity and penetration depth with reference to the generic 2-frame ID-FF capacitive sensor configuration. The models with distinct multi-frame configurations and an associated signal-conditioning circuit are also fabricated. Experiments for sensitivity indicate an average error of less than 6\% with reference to simulation, which is lower than that reported in the recent literature. One of the fabricated sensors is calibrated using the thermogravimetric method. The performance of the fabricated sensors is then compared with a standard commercial sensor with respect to the thermogravimetric method and is found to meet the expected requirements with a correlation coefficient of 0.997.},

	abstract = {Soil particle size significantly influences the water-holding capacity of the soil. Smaller particles have a greater ability to retain water compared to larger particles. As a result, the dielectric behaviour of soil with varying particle sizes changes as the moisture content fluctuates. Therefore, it’s important to consider both the moisture content and the particle size when assessing the dielectric characteristics of soil. This article presents the design and experimental testing of a C-SRR based sensor for determining the dielectric properties of different soil textures as a function of moisture content. The analysis is conducted on three distinct soil types: sandy soil, clayey soil, and loam soil. It operates in both transmissive (S12) and reflective (S11) modes but is more sensitive in the S11 mode. The estimation of soil dielectric properties with varying moisture levels is achieved through the analysis of the displacement in resonance frequency, specifically the S11 notch. It is worth noting that sandy soil exhibits a higher relative permittivity compared to clay and loam soil. Due to its larger particle sizes, the relative permittivity of sandy soil is positively correlated with its M.C. and this correlation is evidenced by the gradual increase in the relative permittivity from 2.6461 to 7.038 with a rise in the M.C. from 0\% to 13\%. In contrast, clayey soil exhibits a comparatively lower relative permittivity, ranging between 2.7366 and 3.9818 as the M.C. changes from 0\% to 13\%, attributed to a higher bound water fraction. The sensor proposed in this work offers a higher sensitivity, approximately 76.44 MHz, and can estimate M.C. (\%) in different soil textures by analyzing the frequency shift. A second-order polynomial equation (R2 = 0.99994) is also formulated to calculate the relative permittivity based on the observed frequency shift. Moreover, three equations have been derived to estimate M.C. (\%) in different soil textures as a function of relative permittivity, resulting in impressive R2 values of 0.9968, 0.9962, and 0.9926 for sandy, loam, and clayey soils, respectively.},

This work evaluates the performance of a low-cost capacitance-resistive sensor for soil moisture and EC measurement in different soil types.

The multilinear regression models developed using experimental data for moisture have an R2 of 0.93, which is at par with the commercial sensors reviewed by researchers. Bulk EC variation with moisture showed significant variation with soil type due to differences in the salinity levels of soil samples.

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in terrestrial systems because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the continental surface and the atmosphere. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology is widely used for the analysis of porous media in SM due to its unique sensitivity to hydrogen protons. Unlike traditional laboratory NMR systems, unilateral NMR (UNMR) systems allow for the placement of detection targets outside the sensor space, thereby enabling in situ detection capabilities. However, in the existing designs of UNMR sensors, the magnetic field location is typically determined after the sensor has been designed. In this study, a novel UNMR sensor design scheme is proposed based on a simplified analytical model (SAM) to solve this problem. In contrast to conventional practices, this scheme places a primary emphasis on the identification of detection positions as its initial step, followed by the computation of magnet structure parameters. Concurrently, the mechanical design of the proposed UNMR sensor offers a more adaptable approach to regulation. The scheme consists of two components: magnetic field calculation and optimization of structural parameters. Notably, the proposed model exhibits a remarkable enhancement in calculation efficiency, surpassing the baseline by more than 70 times within a single iteration, compared with the traditional analytical model (TAM). The goodness of fit between the measured magnetic field distribution and the optimized results surpasses 0.99, thereby providing additional evidence of the sensor’s effectiveness. In addition, the sensor’s performance is demonstrated through measurements conducted on samples with varying SM content.},

In this study, the researchers investigated the suitable soil moisture sensor for optimal agricultural application on clay soil. Five different kinds of soil moisture sensors classified into three resistance-based and two capacitance-based were analyzed. The parameters assessed in the study were precision, linearity, and accuracy. These variables are measured using the raw readings of each sensor; precision was determined using deviation value, linearity was identified using the linearity regression graph, and accuracy was obtained by comparing the expected and actual values of VWC. Each sensor parameter was compared to determine which stands out among the five soil moisture sensors. From the collected data, STEMMA was the most suitable soil moisture sensor for clay applications among the five, with a linearity coefficient of 0.9767, deviation values below 2 (high precision), and an average accuracy of 90.8 percent across five VWC levels.},

The principles and the practical implementations of Bayesian procedures and NNs are briefly discussed in terms of the advantages and disadvantages of each. Experimental tests are carried out by using the same set of training and test data for each method. The methodologies have been applied to two sets of data to retrieve SM from bare soils and to verify their accuracy. One data set contains scatterometer and radiometer data acquired on a variety of agricultural fields in different polarizations, frequencies, and incidence angles. The other is made up of five experiments carried out with a C-band scatterometer on rough and smooth soils at different polarizations and incidence angles. There are significant similarities in the performance of each method; they both retrieve the same features and trends in the analyzed data sets. Algorithm performances change according to SM level and data configuration. The main difficulties are found in retrieving low SM values, and in this case, the error on estimates is reduced when the data with two polarizations or two incidence angles are inserted in the inversion procedure. One major difference between the methodologies is that the NN performance improves, with respect to the Bayesian method, when more inputs are presented as two polarizations or two incidence angles in the training phase.},

In preparation for the Hydros mission, an observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) has been conducted. As a part of this OSSE, the potential for retrieving useful surface soil moisture at spatial resolutions of 9 and 3 km was explored. The approach involved optimally merging relatively accurate 36-km radiometer brightness temperature and relatively noisy 3-km radar backscatter cross section observations using a Bayesian method. Based on the Hydros OSSE data sets with low and high noises added to the simulated observations or model parameters, the Bayesian method performed better than direct inversion of either the brightness temperature or radar backscatter observations alone. The root-mean-square errors of 9-km soil moisture retrievals from the Bayesian merging method were reduced by 0.5 \%vol/vol and 1.4 \%vol/vol from the errors of direct radar inversions for the entire OSSE domain of all 34 consecutive days for the low and high noise data sets, respectively. Improvement in soil moisture estimates using the Bayesian merging method over the direct inversions of radar or radiometer data were even more significant for soil moisture retrieval at 3-km resolution. However, to address the representativeness of these results at the global and multiyear scales, further performance comparison studies are needed, particularly with actual field data.},

This paper examines the applicability of estimating soil moisture states and soil hydraulic parameters through two particle filter (PF) methods: The PF with commonly used sampling importance resampling (PF-SIR) and the PF with recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (PF-MCMC) methods. In a synthetic experiment, the potential of assimilating remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture measurements into a 1-D mechanistic soil water model (HYDRUS-1D) using both the PF-SIR and PF-MCMC algorithms is analyzed. The effects of satellite temporal resolution and accuracy, soil type, and ensemble size on the assimilation of soil moisture are analyzed. In a real data experiment, we first validate the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer--Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture products in the Oklahoma Little Washita Watershed. Aside from rescaling the remotely sensed soil moisture, a bias correction algorithm is implemented to correct the deep soil moisture estimate. Both the ascending and descending AMSR-E soil moisture data are assimilated into the HYDRUS-1D model. The synthetic assimilation results indicated that, whereas both updating schemes showed the ability to correct the soil moisture state and estimate hydraulic parameters, the PF-MCMC scheme is consistently more accurate than PR-SIR. For real data case, the quality of remotely sensed soil moisture impacts the benefits of their assimilation into the model. The PF-MCMC scheme brought marginal gains than the open-loop simulation in RMSE at both surface and root-zone soil layer, whereas the PF-SIR scheme degraded the open-loop simulation.},

Ground and airborne data collected over the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed during the Monsoon'90 experiment were used to test these approaches. These data consisted of eight micrometeorological stations (METFLUX) and six flights of the L-band Push Broom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR). For each PBMR flight, the 180-m resolution L-band pixels covering the eight METFLUX sites were first aggregated to generate a 500-m ldquocoarse-scalerdquo passive microwave pixel. The coarse-scale-derived soil moisture was then downscaled to the 180-m resolution using two different surface soil moisture indexes (SMIs): (1) the evaporative fraction (EF), which is the ratio of the evapotranspiration to the total energy available at the surface; and (2) the actual EF (AEF), which is defined as the ratio of the actual-to-potential evapotranspiration. It is well known that both SMIs depend on the surface soil moisture. However, they are also influenced by other factors such as vegetation cover, soil type, root-zone soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions. In order to decouple the influence of soil moisture from the other factors, a land surface model was used to account for the heterogeneity of vegetation cover, soil type, and atmospheric conditions. The overall accuracy in the downscaled values was evaluated to 3\% (vol.) for EF and 2\% (vol.) for AEF under cloud-free conditions. These results illustrate the potential use of satellite-based estimates of instantaneous evapotranspiration on clear-sky days for downscaling the coarse-resolution passive microwave soil moisture.},

The proposed estimations have been validated using different methods, and a good degree of coherence has been observed between satellite estimations and ground truth measurements over the Banizambou site in Niger. Moisture and rainfall estimations for the same site are shown to be strongly correlated.

Based on the physical basis that the 36.5-GHz (Ka-band) vertical brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the topsoil temperature, a new surface temperature model was developed using all ground measurements available from three networks named CAMP/Tibet, Maqu, and Naqu, established in the TP, which can significantly improve the accuracy of surface temperature derived from the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). Then, the new surface temperature model, which was calibrated with in situ data, was integrated into the soil moisture retrieval algorithm proposed in this letter using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) observations. The algorithm combines the vegetation optical depth and roughness into an integrated factor to avoid making unreliable assumptions and using auxiliary data to get these two parameters. Finally, the algorithm was validated by ground measurements from the dense Naqu network and was compared with NASA AMSR-E and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) official algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm can provide much more accurate soil moisture retrievals than the other two satellite algorithms in the Naqu network region. The algorithm can be applied to the areas with spare vegetation but may not be very suitable for densely vegetated surfaces.},

	abstract = {Geophysical products generated from remotely sensed data require validation to evaluate their accuracy. Typically in situ measurements are used for validation, as is the case for satellite-derived soil moisture products. However, a large disparity in scales often exists between in situ measurements (covering meters to 10 s of meters) and satellite footprints (often hundreds of meters to several kilometers), making direct comparison difficult. Before using in situ measurements for validation, they must be “upscaled” to provide the mean soil moisture within the satellite footprint. There are a number of existing upscaling methods previously applied to soil moisture measurements, but many place strict requirements on the number and spatial distribution of soil moisture sensors difficult to achieve with permanent/semipermanent ground networks necessary for long-term validation efforts. A new method for upscaling is presented here, using Random Forests to fit a model between in situ measurements and a number of landscape parameters and variables impacting the spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture. The method is specifically intended for validation of the NASA soil moisture active passive (SMAP) products at 36-, 9-, and 3-km scales. The method was applied to in situ data from the SoilSCAPE network in California, validated with data from the SMAPVEX12 campaign in Manitoba, Canada with additional verification from the TxSON network in Texas. For the SMAPVEX12 site, the proposed method was compared to extensive field measurements and was able to predict mean soil moisture over a large area more accurately than other upscaling approaches.},

Based on the universal triangular space constructed by the normalized land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study proposes a simple method to estimate surface soil moisture (SSM) using a nonlinear interpolation function with theoretical limiting edges derived from the energy balance principle. As an interpolation function, the quadratic polynomial equation is used to reveal the relationships among soil moisture, LST, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC), which are determined and validated by the simulation data from the Noah land surface model (Noah LSM). The developed function is much simpler than Carlson's function because the number of coefficients is reduced by half. The proposed method is applied to the North China Plain. The estimation results are also validated by the in situ measurements of soil water content at 10 and 20 cm depths at the Yucheng meteorological station; the corresponding biases are as high as 0.02 and 0.12 m3/m3, respectively, and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are approximately 0.04 and 0.10 m3/m3, respectively. The results indicate that this method has high-estimation accuracy and overcomes the weakness induced by the effects of atmospheric conditions on different days. This study provides insight into the comparable soil moisture estimation from remotely sensed data on a regional scale.},

The method was tested against in situ measurements collected over a grass site from 2004 to 2007 (SMOSREX experiment). Two polarizations (horizontal/vertical) and five incidence angles (20°, 30°, 40°, 50°, and 60°) were considered in the analysis. The best wS estimations were obtained when using both polarizations at an angle of 40°. The average accuracy in the soil moisture retrievals was found to be approximately 0.06 m3/m3, improving the estimations by 0.02 m3/m3 with respect to the case in which the vegetation effect is not considered.

	abstract = {Many remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products have been developed with global coverage. However, most of them are derived from passive microwave observations with very coarse resolution, greatly constraining the applications at regional scales. To increase the spatial resolution, a downscaling method is developed to downscale the 36-km Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 SM (SMAP SM) product to 1 km using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (8-d land surface temperature, LST, and 16-d normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). In this method, a linking model is first established between SM and LST and NDVI, and a self-adaptive window method is applied with the use of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to obtain an optimal local regression. Then, the uncertainty of the linking model, expressed as the regression residual, is redistributed to fine-resolution pixels to analyze the consistency before and after downscaling. The method was applied to the Iberian Peninsula to produce the 8-d downscaled SM product in 2016. The downscaled SM was validated with the in-situ SM network (REMEDHUS). A good agreement was found between the two data sets, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.87 and an unbiased root-mean-squared error (ubRMSE) of 0.043 m3/m3 at a network level. At station level, the R is larger than 0.6 for all the REMEDHUS stations, with an ubRMSE smaller than 0.06 m3/m3. The evaluation indicates the good potential of the proposed method in the SM downscaling, which achieves a robust consistency and provides rich spatial information while maintaining good accuracy.},

This letter demonstrates an extension of the alpha approach by employing the juxtaposition method to adaptively set the soil moisture bounds using the absolute radar backscatter values. This extended alpha method was tested using an airborne time series of L-band SAR data and coincident ground measurements acquired during the SMAPEx-3 experiment over bare agricultural fields. The agreement between estimated and measured soil moisture values was within a root-mean-square error of 0.07 cm3/cm3 for each of the three polarization combinations used (i.e., HH, VV, and HH and VV). Moreover, inclusion of the two-polarization combination (HH and VV) slightly improved the retrieval performance.

The soil thermal inertia of Heihe River Basin (HRB) was retrieved based on the RTI model. Furthermore, using a thermal inertia-soil moisture model along with auxiliary data such as soil texture and bulk density, land surface soil moisture was estimated. The results were verified experimentally using the observations made at three automatic weather stations (AWS). The coefficient of the correlation between the retrieved values of soil thermal inertia and measured ones was with above R=0.6 and the root mean square error of soil moisture was 0.072 m3m-3. The soil moisture in the HRB exhibits a seasonal variation with higher values in summer and autumn and lower values in winter and spring, and also exhibits considerable spatial variation with higher values in the upstream district and lower values in the downstream district.},

The method was applied over Chile between 28°S and 43°S for 2010-2012. The data set was used to calibrate and evaluate a semiempirical approach for estimating SM, first by using only the data from SMOS and ERA-Interim and then also including the MODIS vegetation indicator. Results were analyzed for every land cover class using the determination coefficient (r2), the coefficients obtained from the regressions, and the unbiased rootmean-square difference (ubRMSD). Results showed an increase in the average r2 for all classes when a vegetation index was used in the calibration of the approach. The increases in r2 ranged from 3\% for the crop class, to 49\% for the closed shrubland class. The ubRMSD presented a decrease in its value of up to 1\% m3/m3 for the woodlands, open shrublands, and woody shrublands classes and up to 2\% m3/m3 for the closed shrubland class.

	abstract = {The surface soil moisture (SSM) products derived from microwave remote sensing have a coarse spatial resolution; therefore, downscaling is required to obtain accurate SSM at high spatial resolution. An effective way to handle the stratified heterogeneity is to model for various stratifications; however, the number of samples is often limited under each stratification, influencing the downscaling accuracy. In this study, a machine learning-based geostatistical model, which combines various kinds of ancillary information at fine spatial scale, is developed for spatial downscaling. The proposed support vector area-to-area regression kriging (SVATARK) model incorporates support vector regression and area-to-area kriging by considering the nonlinear relationships among variables for various stratifications. SVATARK also considers the change of support problem in the downscaling interpolation process as well as for solving the small sample size in trend prediction. The SVATARK method is evaluated in the Naqu region on the Tibetan Plateau, China, to downscale the European Space Agency's (ESA) 25-km-resolution SSM product. The 1-km-resolution SSM predictions have been produced every eight days over a six-year period (2010-2015). Compared with five other downscaling methods, the downscaled predictions from the SVATARK method performs the best with in situ observations, resulting in a 24.4\% reduction in root-mean-square error with 0.08 m3·m-3 and a 8.2\% increase in correlation coefficient with 0.72, on average. Additionally, anomalously low SSM values, an indicator of drought, had a record low anomaly in mid-July for 2015, as noted by previous studies, indicating that SVATARK could be utilized for drought monitoring.},

Several downscaling methods have been proposed by the SMAP team for this purpose. This paper evaluates another candidate downscaling method, namely, the Bayesian merging approach. While this has been tested using a synthetic data set across the USA, it is imperative that it can also be tested using the experimental data for a comprehensive range of land surface conditions (i.e., in different hydro-climatic regions) prior to a global application. Consequently, this paper applies this method using the data collected from SMAP experiments field campaigns in southeastern Australia that closely simulated the SMAP data stream for a single SMAP radiometer pixel over a three-week interval. The method studied here differs from the linear downscaling methods of the SMAP mission, in that it uses a nonlinear method based on Bayes' theorem. The medium-resolution soil moisture product is obtained using background soil moisture estimates that are updated according to the difference between the observed and predicted brightness temperatures and backscatter coefficients, relating the highand low-resolution data. Results were assessed against a reference soil moisture map derived from high-resolution airborne radiometer observations. The rootmean-square-error and R2 for the Bayesian merging method were found to be 0.02 cm3/cm3 and 0.55, respectively, at 9-km resolution, being similar to the SMAP's “optional” downscaling method.},

However, the classical optical/thermal and microwave fusion, and the active and passive microwave fusion cannot work under all-weather conditions because of contamination of clouds or the lack of suitable radar data source. In this study, a microwave and meteorological fusion (MMF) is provided. The MMF method is based on a complementary relationship hypothesis assuming SMC is reflected in the adjacent surface atmospheric moisture under midday conditions. By this method, daily passive SMC products from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission with 36-km resolution were disaggregated using a daily gridded meteorological data with nominal 4-km resolution. The original and downscaled SMCs were evaluated by comparing with in situ SMC obtained from three core validation sites and three sparse networks. The experiment was conducted in the central part of the U.S. from April 2015 to June 2018. Results demonstrated that the downscaled SMC maintained the dynamic range of original SMC product and energy was conserved. Furthermore, the downscaled SMC showed good agreement with and slightly outperformed the original SMC as compared with in situ SMC. The downscaling method is shown to capture higher resolution SMC spatial variability while preserving the quality of original SMC. However, because of the complexity of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions, the actual contributing domain of downscaled SMC may be greater than 4 km. The MMF method is suggested as a supplementary for all-weather downscaling coarse-resolution SMC.},

Balenzano et al. proposed the alpha approximation method in 2011 for solving some complex issues during the retrieval of soil moisture over agricultural crops with synthetic aperture radar data. However, determining the constraints and solving the underdetermined system of equations in this method add new challenges. Considering the questions of constraints and underdetermined system of equations, the alpha approximation method is used to augment the measured data, and can avoid solving the underdetermined system of equations with constraints directly. Then, these data are applied in a support vector regression machine for soil moisture estimation. It is found that when an optimal model is determined, the method proposed in this article is superior to the direct use of the alpha approximation method, and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) decreased from 0.0775 to 0.0339 and R2 increased from 0.0467 to 0.6491. In addition, the method obtained a good result from a data set collected that included a different growing period of crops by changing the standardized method from StandardScaler to Scale, where the RMSE is 0.0501 and R2 is 0.3204. This indicates the good generalization capability of this method. In conclusion, the proposed method solves the two questions effectively and provides a potential way for long-time or large-scale soil moisture monitoring with much less in situ measurements.},

Spectral variability, caused by variations in viewing and illumination angle and between-sensor variability, further complicates the estimation. In this work, we developed a supervised methodology to accurately estimate SMC from spectral reflectance. The method determines a proxy for the SMC of moist soil, making use of the reflectance spectra of an air-dried and saturated soil sample. The proxy is made invariant to illumination and viewing angle, and sensor type. In the next step, the proxy is normalized with respect to the ground-truth SMC of the saturated soil to make the technique less dependent on the soil type. The normalized proxy can be directly used as an estimate of SMC. Alternatively, the nonlinear relationship between the normalized proxy and the actual SMC can be learned by supervised regression. Experiments are conducted on real moist soil data. In particular, we developed datasets of moist minerals, acquired by two different sensors, an Agrispec spectrometer and an Imec snapscan shortwave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral camera, under strictly controlled experimental settings. The proposed methodology is also validated on the available real moist soil data from the literature. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method accurately estimates the SMC.},

	abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture is a major interest for several practical applications. This task can be suitably performed through various methods; however, at the state of the art, there is not a single method that successfully combines ease of use, low cost, customization, possibility of measuring large volumes, and, most importantly, measurement accuracy. In this regard, seismic wave propagation (SWP)-based methods, which rely on the evaluation of the propagation velocity of a seismic wave vc through the soil sample under investigation, hold considerable potential for practical implementation. On such bases, in this work, first the authors propose an enhanced version of a previously developed SWP-based system for soil moisture measurement. Successively, to provide an exhaustive performance characterization of the system, a specific comparative methodology, based on reference time-domain reflectometry (TDR)-based measurements, is addressed. More specifically, SWP- and TDR-based measurements are simultaneously performed on river sand for increasing levels of water content. The TDR-measured moisture levels are taken as reference values and are used to infer the theoretical propagation velocity values vc, REF. Then, these reference values are suitably compared with those directly measured through the SWP-based system (vc, MEAS), thus allowing a consistent metrological assessment. The ultimate goal of this work is to validate and characterize the performance of the proposed SWP-based system in view of practical implementation for soil moisture evaluation.},

	abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique for mapping of soil moisture with high spatial resolution. C-band SAR can resolve features at field scale, or better, but responds to moisture only within the top 1 to 2 cm of the soil. When validating SAR-derived soil moisture products against standard in situ measurements at 5 to 10 cm depth, the greater moisture variability at the soil surface may be inaccurately categorized as measurement error. An alternative method was developed where the C-band SAR product is validated against soil moisture simulated at 2 cm depth by the HYDRUS-1D model. This reproduces soil moisture depth profiles from daily meteorological observations, leaf area index, and soil hydraulic parameters. The model was fitted at 13 COSMOS-UK sites so that the model output at 10 cm depth closely reproduced the cosmic ray neutron sensor data. At ten of the sites studied, there was an improvement of up to 8\% in root-mean-squared difference by validating the Copernicus surface soil moisture (SSM) product at 2 cm compared to 10 cm. This suggests that Copernicus SSM and other C-band SAR surface soil moisture algorithms may be more accurate than have hitherto been acknowledged.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) dataset with well accuracy and fine spatiotemporal resolution is very valuable in various fields. Downscaling is a promising way to obtain such an SM dataset. There are currently two basic methodologies in the downscaling with satellite datasets, i.e., the machine learning (ML) methods and the physical or semiphysical (PH) models. This study focuses on exploring feasible ways to integrate them for boosting the performance of downscaling. Here, three parallel modes, i.e., arithmetic average (Ari), geometric average (Geo), and weighted average (Wei), and two series modes, i.e., first PH then ML (PH-ML) and first ML then PH (ML-PH), were developed and evaluated. A representative of PH, DSCALE\_mod16, and three ML algorithms, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and LightGBM, were used in this study. Microwave SM datasets from SM Active and Passive (SMAP) Mission, satellite datasets from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and in situ SM observations spanning from April 2015 to December 2018 were employed in the evaluation. Spatial dynamic range, energy conservation, and precision preservation analyses were conducted as evaluation methods. Results demonstrated that the PH-ML series mode outperformed the other coupling modes, which was even better than the better one of the PH and ML. The PH can first generate a valuable initial estimate, and the initial estimate’s advantages can be preserved, while its errors can be suppressed by the ML. Resultantly, the ideology of first using the PH to obtain an initial estimate and then putting the initial estimate into the ML is suggested for further microwave SM downscaling.},

	abstract = {The topography can be very important for passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture due to its complex influence on the emitted brightness temperature observed by a satellite microwave radiometer. In this study, a methodology of using the first brightness Stokes parameter (i.e., the sum of vertical and horizontal polarization brightness temperature) observed by the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) was proposed to improve the soil moisture retrieval under complex topographic conditions. The applicability of the proposed method is validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements collected at four networks (Pali, Naqu, Maqu, and Wudaoliang) on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. The results over Pali, which is a typical mountainous area, showed that soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes parameter are in better agreement with the in-situ measurements (the correlation coefficient R {\textgreater} 0.75 and unbiased root mean square error {\textless}0.04 m3/m3) compared with that using the single-polarization brightness temperature. At the other three networks with relatively flatter terrains, soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes parameter are found to be comparable to the single-polarization retrievals. On the contrary, the maximum bias of the retrieved soil moisture caused by topographic effects exceeds 0.1 m3/m3 when using vertical or horizontal polarization alone, which is far beyond the expected accuracy (0.04 m3/m3) of SMOS satellite. In the regions on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau where the vegetation effect can be ignored, soil moisture retrieved using horizontal polarization brightness temperature is generally underestimated, overestimated when using vertical polarization brightness temperature. It is reasonable due to the polarization rotation effect (depolarization) caused by the topographic effects. It is concluded that the proposed method for soil moisture retrieval using the first brightness Stokes parameter has a great potential in reducing the influence of topographic effects.},

	abstract = {The global soil moisture (SM) retrievals by the spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) are significantly influenced by the presence of water bodies. The traditional method is to build a grid based on the location of satellite sampling points and determine the presence or absence of water bodies. In this article, we propose a water body removal method for global spaceborne GNSS-R SM retrievals that combines water bodies and buffers derived from the marginal areas around water bodies as mask data, thus achieving accurate removal of the water body and avoiding margin effects. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) data with two different spatial resolutions (36 and 3 km) were used for SM retrieval, and the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) Radiometer SM as well as the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) were used as references. Results show that the correlation coefficient ( \$R\$ ) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the 36-km grid are 0.50 and 0.057 cm3/cm3, respectively, while the  \$R\$  and RMSE of the 3-km grid are 0.68 and 0.041cm3/cm3, respectively. Such performances are better than the traditional method. Moreover, the method proposed in this article preserves more grids. Take the 3-km spatial resolution, for example, it preserves 2.2-fold grids more than the traditional water body removal method. In the comparison with SMAP SM, the overall improvement of RMSE by using the water body removal method proposed in this article is 16.3\% (8.2\% for the traditional method). In the in situ validation, the overall improvement of RMSE is 19.4\% (−1.2\% for the traditional method). Therefore, in the future high spatial resolution SM retrieval, the water body removal method proposed in this article can preserve the maximum area and effectively eliminate the influence of water bodies on SM retrieval.},

At present, active and passive remote sensing are the only two ways to monitor SM directly at the regional scale. However, the quality of a single satellite-based SM product is insufficient to meet the requirements of these applications. Hence, fusing these two SM products to improve their quality of change capture ability and accuracy is a necessary and challenging work. This study proposes an improved double instrumental variable method to fuse active and passive SM products. First, the method is improved in finding the best instrumental variables in time series based on the correlation coefficient. Second, fused weights of input SM products are estimated using the improved method. Finally, fused SM products are obtained with higher change capture ability and higher accuracy. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) was selected as the study area to test the algorithm using both of the climate change initiative (CCI) active and passive SM products from the European Space Agency (ESA). The ground validation results show that, compared with the original SM products, the change capture ability, expressed by the correlation coefficient ( \$R\$ ), and the accuracy, expressed by the unbiased root mean square deviation (ubRMSD), have both been improved by about 10\% on average. Compared with the original method, the  \$R\$  and ubRMSD have been improved by more than 30\% on average. This study indicates that the proposed fusion method can effectively improve the quality of SM products to further understand the global changing water cycle.},

	abstract = {Global Navigation System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a microwave remote sensing technology that enables Earth observation by receiving GNSS signals reflected from the Earth's surface. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation is a satellite system that uses GNSS-R technology with high temporal resolution and has been a popular data source in soil moisture retrieval in recent years. However, the constant movement of GNSS transmitters and GNSS-R satellites results in potentially chaotic and random observations of the Earth's surface, with many unevenly distributed gaps in the observed data. In this paper, a gap-filling method based on spatial autocorrelation is proposed to interpolate the gaps within these observation datasets, with SM being estimated post-interpolation. The sample set for the model comprises points surrounding the interpolation target, with modeling conducted considering factors of spatial weighting to estimate values at the interpolation target. Different autocorrelation-based gap-filling methods using CYGNSS data can achieve good estimation accuracy, and the data coverage after interpolation is on average 1.8 times greater than before interpolation. The gap-filling method using XGBoost achieves the best performance and offers the highest accuracy in SM estimation, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.8445, and an average RMSE of 0.0457 m3/m3. The gap-filling approach can significantly enhance data coverage and facilitate the filling of daily gaps in CYGNSS data with all maintaining high SM estimation accuracy. The estimation of daily missing values using CYGNSS data can fully exploit the embedded surface features in the data's fine resolution and can provide high-resolution SM retrieval.},

	abstract = {To address limitations in regional-scale applications of passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products, various downscaling methods have been proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of SM. Nonetheless, these downscaled methods, which are based on optical and thermal infrared data, face challenges in vegetated areas and are prone to inaccuracies due to cloud cover affecting ancillary data. In response to these challenges, we introduced a novel approach termed the vegetation-temperature-radiation-composite (VTRC) method. This method recognizes the robust interaction between vegetation and SM and also appreciates the high sensitivity of surface temperature variation to surface net solar radiation (SSR) in relation to SM. Besides, the VTRC method combines ERA5 data with its high temporal resolution and MODIS data to counteract data loss due to cloud coverage. Applied to downscale the ESA CCI SM products from 0.25° to 0.01° spatial resolution, the VTRC method is validated over Castilla y León (Spain) and Anhui province (China). The VTRC method demonstrates a significant improvement compared to the feature space-based downscaled method and the original ESA CCI products, achieving higher correlation coefficient ( \$R\$ ) of 0.56 and 0.66  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$  in humid and semi-arid regions with ground observations, respectively. Furthermore, it maintains a consistent unbiased root mean square error (ub RMSE) of 0.05  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}\$  in both regions. Additionally, the inclusion of vegetation information notably improves the accuracy in comparison to solely using land surface temperature (LST) and SSR. Significantly, evaluations across varying vegetation cover surfaces revealed enhanced accuracy, especially in regions with abundant vegetation.},

Simulated retrieved soil moisture products are created using three distinct retrieval algorithms based on the characteristics of passive microwave measurements expected from Hydros. The accuracy of retrieval products is evaluated through comparisons with benchmark soil moisture fields obtained from direct aggregation of the original simulated soil moisture fields. The analysis provides a quantitative description of how land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and inversion parameter uncertainty impacts propagate through the measurement and retrieval process to degrade the accuracy of Hydros soil moisture products. Results demonstrate that the discrete set of error sources captured by the OSSE induce root mean squared errors of between 2.0\% and 4.5\% volumetric in soil moisture retrievals within the basin. Algorithm robustness is also evaluated for the case of artificially enhanced vegetation water content (W) values within the basin. For large W({\textgreater}3 kg/spl middot/m/sup -2/), a distinct positive bias, attributable to the impact of sub- footprint-scale landcover heterogeneity, is identified in soil moisture retrievals. Prospects for the removal of this bias via a correction strategy for inland water and/or the implementation of an alternative aggregation strategy for surface vegetation and roughness parameters are discussed.},

	abstract = {A recently developed data assimilation technique offers the potential to greatly expand the geographic domain over which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals can be evaluated by effectively substituting (relatively plentiful) rain-gauge observations for (less commonly available) ground-based soil moisture measurements. The technique is based on calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (Rvalue) between rainfall errors and Kalman filter analysis increments realized during the assimilation of a remotely sensed soil moisture product into the antecedent precipitation index (API). Here, the existing Rvalue approach is modified by reformulating it to run on an anomaly basis where long-term seasonal trends are explicitly removed and by calculating API analysis increments using a Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother instead of a Kalman filter. This reformulated approach is then applied to a number of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer soil moisture products acquired within three heavily instrumented watershed sites in the southern U.S. Rvalue -based evaluations of soil moisture products within these sites are verified based on comparisons with available ground-based soil moisture measurements. Results demonstrate that, without access to ground-based soil moisture measurements, the Rvalue methodology can accurately mimic anomaly correlation coefficients calculated between remotely sensed soil moisture products and soil moisture observations obtained from dense ground-based networks. Sensitivity results also indicate that the predictive skill of the Rvalue metric is enhanced by both proposed modifications to its methodology. Finally, Rvalue calculations are expanded to a quasi-global (50? S-50? N) domain using rainfall measurements derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Precipitation Analysis. Spatial patterns in calculated Rvalue fields are compared to regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling and used to refine expectations concerning the global distribution of land areas in which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals will contribute to atmospheric forecasting applications.},

Carrying out sensitivity studies within a multiscale assimilation system is a significant advancement over previous studies that used a 1-D assimilation framework where all horizontal grids are uncoupled. Twin experiments are performed with synthetic soil moisture retrievals. The hydrologic modeling system is forced with satellite estimated rainfall, and the assimilation performance is evaluated against model simulations using in-situ measured rainfall. The study shows that the assimilation performance is most sensitive to the spatial availability of soil moisture observations, then to revisit time and least sensitive to retrieval accuracy. The horizontally coupled assimilation system performs reasonably well even with large observation errors, and it is less sensitive to retrieval accuracy than the uncoupled system, as reported by previous studies. This suggests that more information may be extracted from satellite soil moisture observations using multiscale assimilation systems resulting in a potentially higher value of such satellite products.},

Here we present a physics-based approach to infer the moisture and ionic concentration in the soil from in-situ, multi-frequency measurements of the impedance of a metamaterial-inspired sensing element buried underground. Such model holds the advantage over empirical models by obviating the need to redo the calibration for different soil types. Our method involves performing an inversion analysis on the Bruggeman's dielectric mixing model. Under the quasi-static assumption, the approach predicts volumetric moisture content and ion concentration with 90\% accuracy in terms of the molar fraction of total volume for silver nitrate concentrations of 0 to 100 mM. We observed that soil conductivity is near-linear to the inferred ionic concentration for a given saline water fraction in the soil. The model has been validated by making multi-frequency impedance measurements of a soil mixture at different concentrations comprising of various constituents of soil, air, water, and ions.},

The results revealed the following: First, in validations using the large, medium, and small scale networks, the small network achieved comparatively superior accuracy with a higher fitting degree and smaller statistical error, proving the reliability and robustness of densely clustered in situ stations. Second, the CLDAS SM can correctly present the promotion effect from precipitation. The most significant response of the CLDAS SM to precipitation lagged from 1 to 3 days in terms of growing depth, whereas promotion to SM tended to decrease as the soil depth increased. Third, CLDAS and GLDAS reasonably fitted in situ measurements in the frozen and unfrozen seasons, while their bias gradually increased with increasing depth. The SM errors in the snow-covered region were relatively stable. Diurnal land surface temperature exhibited a positive correlation with the bias of top-layer SM. In summary, this article shows that CLDAS SM retrievals favorably reproduced values and dynamics of in situ measurements and can be expected to act as a valuable reference for water cycle studies and climate evolution analysis.},

Flight tests of LDCR on a fixed wing sUAS were performed at the Canton, Oklahoma Soilscape site in September 2015, and Irrigation Research Foundation (IRF) in Yuma, Colorado, in June 2016. The LDCR design and performance are discussed, and the calibration using both preflight lab test data and in-flight data over a calm pond was performed to calibrate the radiometer. Radio frequency interference (RFI) from the sUAS platform was observed and mitigated. The LDCR sampling processes are detailed and an implementation of the τ-ω vegetation correction model along with a semiempirical surface roughness correction model incorporating a full-domain soil moisture mapping algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses a weakly nonlinear observation operator suitable for irregular sUAS flight trajectories that maps volumetric soil moisture (VSM) on a user-defined product grid from the sUAS sampling grid. Using LDCR radiometric and thermal measurements, along with Landsat-based vegetation water content (VWC) and soil texture information, soil moisture was mapped at decameter spatial resolution. The retrieved VSM data are favorably compared with in situ VSM measurements and irrigation records. A method for determining LDCR VSM estimation errors is developed to quantify the mapping algorithm accuracy and assess the impact of error sources.},

	abstract = {Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a passive technique for remote sensing of soil moisture, which has continuous all-day and all-weather applicability on different platforms. New GNSS signals with advanced modulation and higher power are expected to improve the performance of GNSS-R. In this study, we performed a ground-based dual-antenna GNSS-R experiment on farmland and collected 15-min raw intermediate frequency (IF) data with a central frequency of 1175.42 MHz hourly over two different 24-h periods. The power ratio between the direct and reflected signals from quasi-zenith satellite system (QZSS) satellites was computed using a self-developed software-defined receiver with 1-ms coherent integration and 200-ms incoherent adds. Then, soil moisture was resolved using a semiempirical model based on power ratios. Solutions were evaluated using measurements obtained using a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probe. Results demonstrated that signal power-ratio-based QZSS signals can be used to retrieve soil moisture under bare soil conditions. Moreover, for signal power-ratio-based case, results from geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite signals (STD: 0.013 and 0.007  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\})\$  performed better than those from inclined geosynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellite signals (STD: 0.033–0.071  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{3\})\$ .},

	abstract = {An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) for the Aquarius/SAC-D mission has been developed for assessing the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals from passive L-band remote sensing. The implementation of the OSSE is based on the following: a 1-km land surface model over the Red-Arkansas River Basin, a forward microwave emission model to simulate the radiometer observations, a realistic orbital and sensor model to resample the measurements mimicking Aquarius operation, and an inverse soil moisture retrieval model. The simulation implements a zero-order radiative transfer model. Retrieval is performed by direct inversion of the forward model. The Aquarius OSSE attempts to capture the influence of various error sources, such as land surface heterogeneity, instrument noise, and retrieval ancillary parameter uncertainty, all on the accuracy of Aquarius surface soil moisture retrievals. In order to assess the impact of these error sources on the estimated volumetric soil moisture, a quantitative error analysis is performed by comparison of footprint-scale synthetic soil moisture with “true” soil moisture fields obtained from the direct aggregation of the original 1-km soil moisture field input to the forward model. Results show that, in heavily vegetated areas, soil moisture retrievals have a positive bias that can be suppressed with an alternative aggregation strategy for ancillary parameter vegetation water content (VWC). Retrieval accuracy was also evaluated when adding errors to 1-km VWC (which are intended to account for errors in VWC derived from remote sensing data). For soil moisture retrieval root-mean-square error on the order of 0.05 m3/m3, the error in VWC should be less than 12\%.},

	abstract = {The existing soil moisture sensing mechanism of the heat pulse probe (HPP) assumes the ideal condition of the soil while overlooking the physics of the device and the composition of the soil and its properties. In the present study, we propose modifications to the soil moisture sensing model of HPP by considering its physical parameters and their appropriate association with the thermal properties of soil and its mineral composition. Primarily, a novel model for the heat strength of the probe of HPP is proposed and examined. It results in  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9809\$ , adjusted  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9721\$ , and root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.73 W/m for experimentally measured values versus obtained values of heat strength using the proposed model. Subsequently, a soil composition-based model is developed resulting in a 19\%–25\% change in the bulk volumetric heat capacity of the soil. A final model of soil moisture estimation is developed by combining the heat strength of the probe of HPP, and the bulk volumetric heat capacity and porosity of the soil. The proposed model suggests improved results in soil moisture measurement in the range of −0.004 to 0.306  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}\$  which can be useful for different applications and several types of soil. Moreover, the model-predicted values of soil moisture are validated with experimental values in previous studies and linked with futuristic applications.  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9763\$ , adjusted  \$\{R\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{2\}\} =0.9527\$ , and RMSE of 0.032  \${\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}/{\textbackslash}text\{m\}{\textasciicircum}\{\{3\}\}\$  are obtained for soil moisture measured experimentally versus values obtained using the proposed model.},

However, the main challenge lies in the potential high dimensionality (104-108) of the agro-hydrological model used for water dynamics, which is modeled based on the nonlinear Richards equation. To address this challenge, we propose a state estimation method for large-scale agricultural fields. Our approach uses an error-triggered adaptive model reduction utilizing a trajectory-based clustering technique. An adaptive extended Kalman filter (EKF) is designed accordingly based on the adaptive reduced model. We apply this to an actual agricultural field and conduct extensive simulations to demonstrate its effectiveness and applicability.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is crucial for agriculture and hydrology, but its accurate prediction is challenging due to inadequate representation of various complex land surface processes and meteorological influences. In this research, we employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) framework, a specific architecture of deep learning networks that is effective in processing time series data, for predicting soil moisture. We have developed the Next Generation Interactive Soil Moisture Forecasting System to advance skillful soil moisture predictions at sub-seasonal timescales by leveraging advanced analytics and deep learning, with LSTM at its core. We combined the state-of-the-art climate model's (Community Earth System Model Version 2) forecast that incorporates the effects of the large-scale climatic drivers, including sea-surface temperature and atmosphere circulation features into soil water forecast with the LSTM-based Deep Learning model. Our Deep Learning model understands the local forecast biases using the weekly hindcast data from 1999 to 2016. We used this trained LSTM model to test its performance from 2017 to 2021 and enhanced the forecast proficiency and aid in analyzing future soil moisture anomalies, i.e., departure from climatology using data fusion and spatial downscaling. For performance assessment, optimal metrics include Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values near 0 (0-0.6), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) around 0.5, and Anomaly Correlation Coefficient (ACC) nearing 1. These breakthroughs in system design and modeling facilitate improved soil moisture prediction, benefiting water management and our understanding of land-atmosphere interactions.},

	abstract = {Agriculture serves as a crucial foundation for developing any growing nation, being the primary source of sustenance and employment. However, in the face of a rapidly changing world, the agricultural sector must adapt to continue fulfilling its role in supporting the country. With climate change altering rainfall patterns, the traditional knowledge that has been passed down through generations for predicting rainfall is no longer adequate for ensuring efficient farming practices. This can result in situations where crops experience either inadequate hydration or excessive irrigation. Under-hydration can be detrimental to crop survival, while over-irrigation poses issues with soil aeration and salinity. The consequences of over-irrigation include increased weed growth and the development of diseases that may shorten plants’ lifespans and diminish overall tree health and vitality. To address these challenges, it becomes essential to adopt innovative techniques that conserve water during the irrigation process. In the proposed system, both soil moisture levels using a soil moisture sensor and the probability of precipitation over the field - fetched from the weather API - are continuously monitored. By combining data from these factors, an optimized decision is made to ensure the plants receive water only when necessary. This approach aims to enhance watering efficiency while promoting optimal plant growth and sustainability.},
