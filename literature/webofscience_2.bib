Abstract = {The actively heated fiber-optic (AHFO) technology has become emerged as
   a research focus due to its advantages of distributed, real-time
   measurement and good durability. These attributes have led to the
   gradual application of AHFO technology to the water content measurement
   of in situ soil. However, all existing in situ applications of AHFO
   technology fail to consider the effect of soil-sensor contact quality on
   water content measurements, limiting potential for the wider application
   of AHFO technology. To address this issue, the authors propose a method
   for determining the soil-sensor thermal contact resistance based on the
   principle of an infinite cylindrical heat source. This is then used to
   establish an AHFO water content measurement technology that considers
   the thermal contact resistance. The reliability and validity of the new
   measurement technology are explored through a laboratory test and a
   field case study, and the spatial-temporal evolution of the soil water
   content in the case is revealed. The results demonstrate that method for
   determining the soil-sensor thermal contact resistance is highly
   effective and applicable to all types of soils. This method requires
   only the moisture content, dry density, and thermal response of the in
   situ soil to be obtained. In the field case, the measurement error of
   soil water content between the AHFO method, which takes into account the
   thermal contact resistance, and the neutron scattering method is only
   0.011. The water content of in situ soil exhibits a seasonal variation,
   with an increase in spring and autumn and a decrease in summer and
   winter. Furthermore, the response of shallow soils to precipitation and
   evaporation is significant. These findings contribute to the enhancement
   of the accuracy of the AHFO technology in the measurement of the water
   content of in situ soils, thereby facilitating the dissemination and
   utilization of this technology. (c) 2024 Institute of Rock and Soil

Abstract = {Soil water content measurement is critical in practical engineering. The
   actively heated fiber Bragg grating optic sensor (FBGS) has great
   potential of multi-point measurement for soil water content measurement
   in field. In this study, the effect of heating time on the measurement
   accuracy is discussed, and modifications are made for actively heated
   fiber optic (AHFO) sensors. The results demonstrate that if an
   integration data analysis method is used, the accuracy and reliability
   of soil water content measurement with AHFO sensors will be improved.
   Both a short fiber length and a short-term heating pattern are effective
   and can help to reduce soil disturbance. With the proposed integration
   method, a short heating time is guaranteed for measuring the soil water
   content. Such improvements will reduce the thermal disturbance to soil
   sample and improve the reliability of measurement. (C) 2020 Institute of

Abstract = {This article proposes a hybrid symbolic aggregate approximation and
   vector space model (SAX-VSM) method for automatically classifying soil
   water content cycles. In the proposed method, a novel similarity
   measure, the distance weighted cosine (DWC) similarity measure, is
   introduced to improve the classification performance of the SAX-VSM. The
   DWC similarity measure incorporates both direction and distance
   information of feature vectors. Meanwhile, a mixed-integer optimization
   problem is formulated to determine hyperparameters. An extended Rao-1
   algorithm, I-Rao-1 algorithm, is developed to solve such optimization
   problems. To verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed
   method, three soil moisture data sets collected from the Florida
   research trials are employed. Compared with state-of-the-art methods,
   the proposed method has achieved the best performance based on all data
   sets in terms of the highest accuracy, precision, and recall values.
   Therefore, it is promising to apply the proposed method into real
   applications in the smart irrigation system.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture sensing is one of the most important components in smart
   agriculture. It plays a critical role in increasing crop yields and
   reducing water waste. However, existing commercial soil moisture sensors
   are either expensive or inaccurate, limiting their real-world
   deployment. In this paper, we utilize wide-area LoRa signals to sense
   soil moisture without a need of dedicated soil moisture sensors.
   Different from traditional usage of LoRa in smart agriculture which is
   only for sensor data transmission, we leverage LoRa signal itself as a
   powerful sensing tool. The key insight is that the dielectric
   permittivity of soil which is closely related to soil moisture can be
   obtained from phase readings of LoRa signals. Therefore, antennas of a
   LoRa node can be placed in the soil to capture signal phase readings for
   soil moisture measurements. Though promising, it is non-trivial to
   extract accurate phase information due to unsynchronization of LoRa
   transmitter and receiver. In this work, we propose to include a low-cost
   switch to equip the LoRa node with two antennas to address the issue. We
   develop a delicate chirp ratio approach to cancel out the phase offset
   caused by transceiver unsynchronization to extract accurate phase
   information. The proposed system design has multiple unique advantages
   including high accuracy, robustness against motion interference and
   large sensing range for large-scale deployment in smart agriculture.
   Experiments with commodity LoRa nodes show that our system can
   accurately estimate soil moisture at an average error of 3.1\%,
   achieving a performance comparable to high-end commodity soil moisture
   sensors. Field studies show that the proposed system can accurately
   sense soil moisture even when the LoRa gateway is 100 m away from the
   LoRa node, enabling wide-area soil moisture sensing for the first time.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Controlling soil moisture is crucial in optimizing watering and crop
   performance. Traditional monitoring systems rely on a single sensor or
   on a column of sensors that do not allow farmers to properly capture
   soil moisture dynamics in the soil volume occupied by roots. In this
   paper we propose PLUTO, an original approach that builds fine-grained 2D
   and 3D soil moisture profiles by relying on a grid of sensors. Profiles
   are computed using both interpolation-based and machine learning
   approaches. Besides the technical description of the approach, the paper
   reports a set of original visualizations and a large set of tests
   computed, over two years, on real Kiwi orchards. PLUTO proved to largely
   overcome the accuracy of profiles obtained with traditional sensor
   layouts. Considering that the cost of sensors is progressively
   decreasing, PLUTO provides a cost-effective, operative, and precise
   solution to moisture monitoring.},

Title = {A pipeline robot system for monitoring soil water content distribution},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {620},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Monitoring soil water content (SWC) distribution is crucial for better
   understanding soil water dynamics and accurate hydrological modeling. In
   this study, a pipeline robot system for monitoring SWC distribution is
   designed to improve the current technical problems of insufficient
   measurement distance and low positioning accuracy of the existing SWC
   monitoring platform. The system consists of a pipeline robot, a fixed
   base station and a PVC pipe. The robot could fit into a 55-mm-diameter
   PVC pipe to measure SWC distribution horizontally, vertically, or at any
   angle to the horizontal direction. The base station serves as a data
   collector and also supplies power and distance information for
   recharging and positioning the robot, respectively. A series of tests
   for evaluating the performance of the pipeline robot system were
   conducted. Field experiments were also conducted to monitor soil water
   infiltration and horizontal distribution of SWC of crop root zone at
   three plots. The results showed that the minimum radius of volume of
   sensitivity of the dielectric sensor is about 2.25 cm. The robot for
   mobile measurement performed stable both in horizontal and vertical
   directions and the response of the dielectric sensor output to different
   dielectric materials is significant. The accumulated error of the
   encoder is effectively decreased from 4.3\% to 1.2\% by correcting the
   position error using the laser ranging sensor. The measured SWCs during
   the calibration experiment were highly correlated with those obtained by
   the drying method (R-2 = 0.990 and RMSE = 0.0181 cm(3) cm(-3)). The
   results of the field experiments demonstrated that the system is
   feasible for monitoring soil water infiltration in the vertical
   direction and SWC distributions of crop root zone horizontally at the
   three plots, indicating that the potential application of the developed
   system for long-term monitoring of SWC distribution under field
   conditions in the near future.},

Abstract = {Measuring soil moisture by the dielectric method is considered. It was
   revealed that the complex dielectric permeability (CDP) affects the
   readings of sensors using different physical principles in different
   ways. The results of CDP measurements for six samples are given: river
   sand, bentonite, three samples of Haplic Chernozem (Loamic) of the Omsk
   region and a mixture of chernozemic material and river sand. Content of
   particles less than 0.01 mm in size in the samples varied from 1.7 to
   72\%; the content of organic carbon ranged from 0 to 4.12\%.
   Measurements of CDP were performed at different values of moisture at
   the frequencies from 10 kHz to 4-8 GHz in the same cell using the
   original technique developed by authors. It was noted that at
   frequencies below 20-30 MHz, the dielectric permittivity is an ambiguous
   function of moisture owing to the strong influence of the conductivity
   of the soil solution and of interlayer dielectric relaxation on it.
   Moisture measurements are best to perform in the frequency range 0.5-3
   GHz, where the effect of interlayer relaxation and soil solution
   conductivity on the CDP is negligible. Measurements of soil moisture and
   conductivity were performed using a Decagon 5TE capacitive sensor. The
   calibration dependency that is valid for different soils, considering
   the conductivity of the soil measured by this sensor was found. The
   error of moisture measurements using this dependency is 0.035 m(3)/m(3).
   The use of individual calibration dependencies for each of soils reduces
   the error to 0.014 m(3)/m(3). Results of the work can be used to improve
   the accuracy of soil moisture measurement by the dielectric method.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a highly sensitive differential soil moisture sensor
   (DSMS) using a microstrip line loaded with triangular two-turn resonator
   (T2-SR) and complementary of the rectangular two-turn spiral resonator
   (CR2-SR), simultaneously. Volumetric Water Content (VWC) or permittivity
   sensing is conducted by loading the T2-SR side with dielectric samples.
   Two transmission notches are observed for identical loads relating to
   T2-SR and CR2-SR. The CR2-SR notch at 4.39 GHz is used as a reference
   for differential permittivity measurement method. Further, the resonance
   frequency of T2-SR is measured relative to the reference value. Based on
   this frequency difference, the permittivity of soil is calculated which
   is related to the soil VWC. Triangular two-turn resonator (T2-SR)
   resonance frequency changes from 4 to 2.38 GHz when VWC varies 0\% to
   30\%. The sensor's operation principle is described through circuit

Abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring and irrigation scheduling are essential

   a promising solution for automating irrigation procedures and improving

   method is introduced to measure soil moisture level along with providing
   energy to run a low-power transmitter as an alarm signal. A combination
   of a metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) and two rectifiers that are
   designed at different frequencies specifies 5\% and 25\% soil moisture
   levels. The sensor monitors the soil moisture continuously without
   consuming energy. Once the soil moisture becomes 5\% of the first
   rectifier starts working and provides 65 \$\textbackslash{}text\{uW\}\$
   dc output, while the second rectifier is off. Increasing the soil
   moisture to 25\%, the second rectifier creates 100 uW dc output when the
   first rectifier is off. The designed structure is fabricated on RO4003
   in a \$4\$ \$\textbackslash{}times\$ \$4\$ array. The measurement
   results are provided by performing a set of different experiments.
   Initially, the MPA's absorption characteristics are validated facing
   different polarization and incident angles. Then, the sensing capability
   is proven by burying the proposed sensor under sand and measuring the dc
   outputs of rectifiers. A strong correlation between simulation and
   measurement results validates the design procedure.},

Journal = {OPTICS AND LASERS IN ENGINEERING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {178},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The determination of the amount of moisture in soil is crucial in
   several application fields such as agricultural, geotechnical,
   hydrological, and environmental engineering. In this paper, we propose
   the use of an advanced alloptical self-heated sensing platform for
   highly sensitive and repeatable monitoring of the soil volumetric water
   content (VWC). The proposed platform is realized by integrating, inside
   a standard metallic needle, a fiber optic heating device integrated with
   a fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG) acting as thermal monitor. The all
   optical active heating device consists of two main components: i) a core
   offset fusion splice between two single mode optical fibers to spread
   light from the core to the cladding and ii) a metal-coated region of the
   fiber where the FBG is inscribed. A full characterization of the
   proposed device has been performed for different VWC values from 9 to 36
   \%VWC in the soil temperature range between 5 and 40 degrees C.
   Collected results demonstrate that the proposed platform is able to
   perform highly stable, fast, robust and energy efficient measurements of
   the soil water content, with a repeatability error of 1.5 \%VWC, time
   response <= 10 s and resolution <= 0.25 \%VWC. The possibility of tuning
   the value of the injected power according to the application makes the
   proposed sensor extremely flexible and versatile for its exploitation in
   large areas and/or long-distance monitoring applications with relevant
   advantages in terms of energy savings, costs and system complexity.},

Abstract = {This article presents a new soil moisture monitoring system (SMMS) for
   precision agriculture applications. The system consists of a
   metamaterial-inspired microwave sensor and an electronic backend. The
   sensor was built on a biodegradable dielectric substrate, emphasizing
   sustainability, and uses a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR)
   coupled to a microstrip line for excitation. This resonator, being a
   planar artificial structure with metamaterial properties, exhibits
   composite left/right-handed propagation, thereby displaying sensitivity
   to the dielectric constant of the applied medium. Accordingly, the
   sensing mechanism involves establishing a correlation between the soil
   moisture content and the relative displacement of the sensor's resonance
   frequency, which varies as the soil's dielectric constant changes due to
   moisture variations. The backend is controlled by an ESP32 module, which
   fulfills the tasks of signal capture, processing the data, and
   delivering the corresponding soil moisture. The transmission of data
   occurs via Wi-Fi using the MQ telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. To
   ensure accuracy, the sensor was calibrated using a gravimetric-based
   method for sandy and clay soil types. A curve-fitting model was
   extracted, exhibiting remarkable precision (R-2 = 0.997), enabling the
   system to detect moisture levels from 0\% to 20\% for both soil types.
   The overall relative error was found to be 3.6\% for sand and 8.3\% for
   clay. Finally, the results obtained from the evaluation of the system in
   typical sandy soil conditions are presented. The system demonstrated its
   effectiveness by continuously detecting moisture levels ranging from 5\%
   to 11\% over a duration of 33 h, thereby confirming its viability for
   practical implementation.},

Abstract = {Development and deployment of sensing technologies is one of the main
   steps in achieving sustainability in crop production through precision
   agriculture. Key sensing methodologies developed for monitoring soil
   moisture and nutrients with recent advances in the sensing devices
   reported in literature using those techniques are overviewed in this
   article. The soil moisture determination has been divided into four main
   sections describing soil moisture measurement metrics and
   laboratory-based testing, followed by in-situ, remote and proximal
   sensing techniques. The application, advantages and limitations for each
   of the mentioned technologies are discussed. The nutrient monitoring
   methods are reviewed beginning with laboratory-based methods,
   ion-selective membrane based sensors, bio-sensors, spectroscopy-based
   methods, and capillary electrophoresis-based systems for inorganic ion
   detection. Attention has been given to the core principle of detection
   while reporting recent sensors developed using the mentioned concepts.
   The latest works reported on the different sensing methodologies point
   towards the trend of developing low-cost, easy to use, field-deployable
   or portable sensing systems aimed towards improving technology adoption
   in crop production leading to efficient site-specific soil and crop

Abstract = {This study was conducted with the aim of developing a circuit system
   that enables the measurement of the moisture content and ion
   concentration with a simple circuit configuration. Our previous studies
   have shown that soil can be represented by an equivalent circuit of a
   parallel circuit of resistors and capacitors. We designed a circuit that
   can convert the voltage transient characteristics of the soil when a
   current is applied to it into a square wave and output frequency
   information and developed an algorithm to analyze the two types of
   square waves and calculate R and C. Normal operation was confirmed in
   the range of 10 k omega-1 M omega for the designed circuit, and the
   calculation algorithm matched within a maximum error of 5\%, thus
   confirming the validity of the program. These successfully confirmed the
   changes in the water content and ionic concentration. The soil moisture
   content measurement succeeded in measuring a maximum error of about
   10\%, except at one point, and the soil ion concentration measurement
   succeeded in measuring a maximum error of 6.6\%. A new, simple,
   noise-resistant moisture content and ion concentration measurement

Abstract = {One of the crucial variables for accurate irrigation models is soil
   moisture data. Recent advancement in microsensors has opened avenues to
   fabricate low-cost and highly sensitive soil moisture sensors for in
   situ measurements. For these microsensors, sensing films play a pivotal
   role, considering the selectivity and sensitivity. In this work, we have
   explored the Ti3C2Tx MXene two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials as the
   soil moisture sensor's sensing film. For this purpose, the
   interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) have been fabricated on the silicon
   substrate using the micromanufacturing method. To understand the
   characteristics of the Ti3C2Tx MXene 2D nanomaterials, X-ray diffraction
   (XRD) is adopted to confirm the structural analysis. Fourier transform
   infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is carried out to identify the exciting
   chemical bonds for Ti3C2Tx MXene. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and
   energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis are used to study the morphology
   and elemental composition of Ti3AlC2 MAX and Ti3C2Tx MXene phases,
   respectively. Further, the sensor transfer function has been studied for
   three different soil samples, viz., clayey soil, loamy sand soil, and
   sandy loam soil, under laboratory conditions. The performed measurements
   indicate that the response of fabricated soil moisture sensors is about
   500, 2400, and 1700\% for the clayey, loamy sand, and sandy loam soils
   at 300 Hz, respectively, for the gravimetric water content (GWC) ranging
   from 1 to 18\% GWC. Interestingly, the hysteresis of the fabricated
   sensor on the loamy sand soil is about +/- 1\% GWC, whereas for the
   sandy loam and clayey soils, it is around +/- 3 and +/- 6\% GWC,
   respectively. Further, the fabricated sensor shows a high selectivity
   toward the water molecule when compared with the other ions (Cu+, Cd+,
   Na+, and K+) in the soil samples.},

Title = {Quasi-distributed fiber-optic in-situ monitoring technology for
   large-scale measurement of soil water content and its application},
Journal = {ENGINEERING GEOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {294},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Accurate acquisition of in-situ soil water content is of great
   significance for mastering the water content distribution of unsaturated
   soil and understanding soil engineering properties. The actively heated
   fiber-optic (AHFO) method has recently become a research focus because
   of the capability to realize distributed and real-time measurement of
   soil water content. However, most reported AHFO systems have been
   coupled to distributed temperature sensing (DTS) which does not allow
   for remote measurements with high spatial resolution. In this paper, a
   new AHFO method based on the quasi-distributed fiber Bragg grating
   (AHFO-FBG) technique is proposed for the large-scale in-situ measurement
   of soil water content. An AHFO-FBG in-situ monitoring system is
   developed which consists of a sensor module, heating module, data
   acquisition and transmission module, and data processing module. The
   established system is applied to a loess slope in Yan'an City, Shaanxi
   Province, China to monitor its water content distribution in real time.
   The effectiveness of the monitoring system is verified and the water
   content distribution of the monitored loess slope are analysed. The
   in-situ measurement results indicate that in the spatial dimension, the
   water content in the top and bottom of the slope is low, and that near
   the scarp is high; in the time dimension, the water content in winter is
   low while that in autumn and spring is high. The monitored results also
   suggest that soil water evaporation in winter can significantly enhance
   the spatial distribution difference of soil water content.},

Title = {Monitoring near-surface soil water content using an innovative
   perforated cylinder coaxial dielectric sensor},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Near-surface soil water content (NSWC) is an important parameter for
   characterizing hydrological processes, water and vapor exchange at the
   soil-atmosphere boundary, and potential biological productivity. Here we
   develop a dielectric based frequency-domain (FD) impedance sensor
   operating at 100 MHz, with a novel coaxial probe design and a
   temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board. This perforated
   cylinder coaxial (PCC) sensor provides simultaneous measurements of
   volumetric soil water content (VSWC) and of temperature. The temperature
   measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the
   circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water. We characterize the
   performance of the PCC sensor and compare it with alternative 3-pin- and
   2-pin-electrode FD impedance sensors each using a similarly performing
   circuit board. A series of theoretical analyses and experiments were
   conducted, including (i) sensors calibration, (ii) temperature effects
   and their correction, (iii) soil volume sensed by each sensor through
   simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal (SSR) test and (iv)
   accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the NSWC
   measurements. The calibration results verified that the PCC, 3-pin and
   2-pin probes were suitable to measure VSWC (RMSE <= 0.0142 cm(3)
   cm(-3)). The simulation analysis using High Frequency Structure
   Simulator software (HFSS) indicated that the novel PCC probe had a
   symmetrical distribution of the E-field, wholly contained within the
   cylinder, avoiding leakage of the E-Field into air at the
   soil-atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume
   on VSWC. The results of the SSR test showed that the E-field distributed
   outside the receiving electrode of the PCC probe could be ignored
   whereas that of both pin-type electrodes was distributed outside of the
   receiving electrode to a distance that depended on VSWC (i.e. up to 8 mm
   for 3-pin and up to 11 mm for 2-pin designs when VSWC > 0.17 cm(3)
   cm(-3)), which corresponds to the simulation analysis. Moreover, the new
   PCC probe provided more accurate NSWC measurement than 3-pin or 2-pin
   probes because the E-field was contained within the perforated cylinder,
   avoiding E-field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of
   VSWC. The pin-structure probes appear to perform best when installed
   horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface.},

Title = {Automation of soil moisture sensor-based basin irrigation system},
Journal = {SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Irrigation is one of the largest consumers of fresh water in the
   agricultural sector. Surface irrigation is one the most widely adopted
   method of irrigation due to its simplicity and low energy requirement.
   Although, it is mostly associated with poor irrigation application
   efficiency mainly due to deep percolation and uneven distribution of
   irrigation water. A study was conducted in closed-end level basin layout
   in loamy soil to establish and test an Internet of Things (IoT) based
   system through a wireless connection between the automatic check gate
   and soil moisture sensors which can be operated remotely based on
   real-time soil moisture status. An attempt had been made to identify the
   suitable location of the sensor in the basin layout for improving
   irrigation application efficiency. An aluminium automatic-check gate
   fitted in an iron frame was placed in the concrete water supply channel
   to control the water flow. Three capacitance-based soil moisture sensors
   were placed at 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of field length (i.e., 15 m, 30 m and
   45 m) at 37.5, 15 cm and 7.5 cm depth, respectively. A wireless
   communication network was established between capacitance-based soil
   moisture sensors and an automatic check gate through the LoRa module and
   GSM module. The software used for automatic control of the check gate in
   this study was Croplytics (R) by Agsmartic. The system was tested for
   nine irrigation events under bare soil conditions. Three different
   operational schedules based on different soil moisture sensor placement
   had been tested under 40\%, 30\% and 20\% soil moisture deficit
   conditions. The results suggested that the best location of sensors for
   closing the system would be at 37.5 cm depth placed at 25\% length from
   the inlet in higher soil moisture deficit condition and at 7.5 cm depth
   placed at 75\% length in low moisture deficit condition. Overall, the
   irrigation application efficiency was improved up to 86.6\% with
   automation.},

Abstract = {Rice is the primary food source for millions of Asians and satisfies the
   most fundamental requirement for human survival. The paddy scarcity has
   heightened public awareness of the global food problem. Rice yield and
   quality are affected by various factors, including soil nutrients,

   Internet of Things (IoT) based mobile device for measuring soil
   nutrients in real-time. The proposed system consists of electrical
   conductivity (EC) and temperature sensors with TTGO T-Beam
   microcontroller and IoT connectivity. During experimental work, the
   results showed that the observed EC data near the calibration solution
   conductivity of 12.88mS/cm and 150mS/cm, which are less than 2\% from
   the calibration solution's stated value. Furthermore, it is found that
   the measured EC value increases with temperature (linearly
   proportional). The study showed that the soil's EC of sensor node 1 at 5
   cm depth without fertiliser is 1.04375mS/cm and with fertiliser is
   3.86mS/cm, while at 10 cm depth without fertiliser is 0.65625mS/cm and
   with fertiliser is 420mS/cm. These investigations show that soil EC is
   directly linked to nutrient availability and soil depth.},

Abstract = {In agriculture production, soil moisture management is one of the
   parameters for the sustainable use of natural resources. Soil
   tensiometers are the instruments used for measuring soil matric
   potential to monitor soil moisture content. The tensiometer contains a
   vacuum gauge for the visual indication for irrigation managers to
   monitor field moisture within the maximum allowable deficit. The vacuum
   gauge has the limitation that it does not provide its output in the form
   of an electrical signal, which is used as input for an automatic
   irrigation system. So, the present work was carried out to develop and
   evaluate a piezoresistive-based soil moisture sensors system for precise
   irrigation scheduling through automation devices. The experiment was
   carried out in the Centre for Protected Cultivation Technology, IARI,
   New Delhi, and it contains sandy loam soil. The development of a
   piezoresistive-based sensor for automatic irrigation scheduling can be
   done by using a piezoresistive sensor, XBee transmitter and receiver,
   microcontroller, water meter, and relay unit. Once development was
   completed, it was tested and compared with a conventional tensiometer at
   different chrysanthemum and tomato crop depths. The relative root mean
   square error (RRMSE) of soil moisture content for tensiometer and
   piezoresistive-based soil moisture sensor varied from 9.47 to 19.38 and
   7.44 to 18.28, respectively. The coefficient of determination for
   tensiometer and piezoresistive-based soil moisture varies from 0.71 to
   0.72 and 0.82 to 0.84, respectively. The paired t-test was used to
   compare the developed and conventional tensiometer, and it was found
   that both sensors were significantly different at a 5\% significance
   level.},

Abstract = {The traditional measurement method can't achieve real-time monitoring of
   soil moisture content (SMC) within a two-dimensional area. To solve the
   above problems, we propose a rapid SMC monitoring method for
   two-dimensional area based on distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). DAS
   demodulates the backward Rayleigh scattering signal containing seismic
   wave sound velocity information from the active seismic source. The
   folding ruler approximation is employed to calculate the sound velocity
   of the soil, which is then inverted to determine the soil moisture
   content. The experiment measured the soil within a two-dimensional area
   formed by the seismic source and the acoustic sensing optical cable. The
   sensing optical cable and the active seismic source are organized into a
   two-dimensional area and the measurement range is 3 x 10 m with 33
   points. The SMC ranges from 15\% to 40\%. The experiment shows that the
   absolute error between the measured values obtained by DAS and the water
   cut meter is 7\%. This experiment verifies the feasibility of using the
   Rayleigh scattering properties to invert SMC and provides a new method
   for real-time monitoring of SMC in a large area.},

Abstract = {According to the big impact hypothesis, the moon should be very dry.
   However, more and more evidence from the remote sensing of the moon in
   recent years indicates that there is a lot of water in the moon's polar
   regions. Researching the source and distribution of volatiles such as
   water can provide a key constraint on the formation and evolution of the
   moon. If there is a large amount of a volatile such as water ice in the
   polar area of the moon, it can be used as a further resource.
   Regrettably, there are no detectors in place to detect the amount and
   presence of water to date. In the new wave of lunar exploration, polar
   water has become one of the main tasks of NASA, ESA and RKA. The
   Chang'e-7 spacecraft of China's fourth lunar exploration phase has also
   used the Water Molecular Analyzer and the Lunar Soil Volatile Measuring
   Instrument to detect water content in the lunar polar region. This paper
   introduces a set of methods and principles for analyzing water content
   via the heat flux method according to the characteristics of the Lunar
   Soil Volatile Measuring Instrument that was deployed on the lunar
   surface. According to the current design, the water content of 0.008

Abstract = {The moisture level in the soil has significant consideration for
   applications in agriculture such as crop growth, yield percentage, land
   stability, and heat exchange. A thorough examination of these properties
   will provide explanations for hydrological, meteorological, and
   agricultural applications. Remote sensing techniques such as thermal,
   optical, active, and passive microwave measurements can precisely study
   the aforementioned properties. This paper examines current advances and
   prospective studies in agricultural applications using active remote
   sensing methods, concluding that remote sensing techniques have a
   greater potential for exploring many domains of agricultural
   applications.},

Title = {A method of electrical conductivity compensation in a low-cost soil
   moisture sensing measurement based on capacitance},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {150},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The detection of soil moisture is one of the most important researches
   in the development of precision agriculture. At present, the detection
   of soil dielectric constant is the most effective and convenient method
   to measure soil moisture content. Most of the dielectric type soil
   moisture sensors reduce the influence of soil salinity, texture and
   other factors on the measurement by detecting at high frequency.
   However, this will increase the production cost of the measurement
   circuit and fail to meet the requirements for large-scale deployment of
   sensors in agricultural production. The method of low-frequency
   capacitance detection has a price advantage but a low measurement
   accuracy, thus the application is very limited. This paper intends to
   improve the measurement accuracy and application range of low-frequency
   capacitance moisture sensors by correcting the relationship between
   low-frequency capacitance and moisture through the detection of soil
   conductivity. Three modified models (logistic, exponential and
   polynomial) to estimate the moisture content was verified by comparing
   with the oven-drying method calibration value. The results indicated
   that the MAME and MAE of the logistic model was less than 3.55\% and
   2.50\%, respectively, which can satisfy most agricultural production
   requirements for soil moisture detection. Therefore, the study provided
   an effective detection method for low-cost soil moisture detection in
   low salinity and low organic matter soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All

Title = {Monitoring of soil water content using spherical smart aggregates based
   on electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique},
Journal = {SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Real-time monitoring of soil water content is of great significance to
   prevent many engineering accidents, such as landslide, water seepage of
   foundation dam, and reduction of foundation bearing capacity.
   Electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique based smart aggregates (SAs)
   have showed excellent monitoring capability in various engineering
   applications. However, there are limited reports on the application of
   EMI based SAs in the monitoring of the soil water content. In this
   paper, the EMI based spherical SAs (SSAs) were investigated in the
   monitoring of soil water content. Firstly, the SSAs were designed and
   fabricated using the monolithic concrete encapsulation method, and their
   stable performance in air were evaluated, and confirmed by testing and
   analyzing the impedance spectrum. Then, the fabricated SSAs were
   immersed in the water environment for 28 d to ensure the stability under
   the working conditions, such as the soil with high water content and the
   hydration process of early-age concrete. Secondly, the monitoring
   experiments of soil water content were carried out based on the SSAs and
   the traditional SAs using the EMI technique. The measured impedance
   signatures under different water contents in soil were quantified by
   three types of statistical indexes, including root mean square
   deviation, mean absolute percentage deviation, and correlation
   coefficient deviation. The experimental results show that compared with
   the traditional SAs, the SSAs are more sensitive and stable to monitor
   the soil water content. Finally, the effect of temperature on the
   performance of SSA based on the EMI technique were conducted
   experimentally. The results demonstrate that temperature has influence
   on the monitoring results of the SSAs based on the EMI technique.},

Title = {Research on regional soil moisture dynamics based on hyperspectral
   remote sensing technology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LOW-CARBON TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {737-749},
Month = {FEB 4},
Abstract = {In order to realize the dynamic analysis of regional soil moisture
   content in the upper reaches of Xiashan Reservoir in Weihe River Basin,
   Weifang City, Shandong Province, a regional soil moisture dynamic
   analysis model based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology is
   proposed. The process of predicting and deducing the soil water content
   through the spectral information of remote sensing images, surface
   parameters and other data can reflect the soil spectral information. The
   band sensitive to the change of soil moisture in remote sensing image is
   directly extracted, which is used as the independent variable input in
   the soil water logging inversion model, and the process of soil moisture
   prediction is conducted with the measured soil moisture value as the
   dependent variable input. The SI-1, SI-2 and other water spectral
   indexes that can reflect the water information are constructed, and the
   water spectral index used for soil water content retrieval is
   constructed through various relationships between bands. Compared with
   the spectral reflectance alone, the use of water spectral index greatly
   improves the retrieval accuracy. The particle filter algorithm is used
   to assimilate the observed data and simulated data to obtain the
   assimilated soil moisture. Error evaluation indicators are used to
   evaluate the accuracy of the obtained assimilation results and further
   use different particle numbers and observation errors to conduct
   multiple data assimilation experiments to explore the sensitivity of
   particle numbers and observation errors to the assimilation results. The
   root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE) and mean absolute
   error (MAE) are used to test and verify the effect of data assimilation.
   The test shows that the dynamic analysis of the regional soil moisture
   content in the upper reaches of Xiashan Reservoir in the Fangwei River
   basin by using this method the distribution map obtained by dividing the
   vegetation coverage are more consistent with the actual situation in
   terms of the proportion of different soil water salinization degrees,
   the regional distribution of water, etc. The idea of using hyperspectral
   remote sensing to retrieve soil moisture is effective.},

Volume = {24},
Number = {3},
Pages = {2367-2380},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {In this review, we have evaluated several methods and recent
   technologies to determine the soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
   (NPK) content to increase yield production. Sensing technology has been
   used for a long time to determine the exact amount of soil nutrients
   without going through a conventional time-consuming, and expensive
   laboratory testing process. Several types of sensors are developed to
   measure the quantity of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K)
   present in the soil, basically known as NPK sensor that provides
   on-the-go detection. A significant need for compact, inexpensive,
   low-power, and rapid soil NPK sensors is anticipated due to the demand
   for enhanced agriculture production and the future widespread usage of
   the Internet of Things (IoT). This fact implies using advanced
   technologies for both sensing elements and rapid detection. In recent
   years, machine learning (ML) techniques have also been utilized to
   optimize soil NPK levels. These techniques involve training models on
   large datasets of soil samples and their corresponding nutrient levels,
   allowing for accurate prediction of nutrient concentrations based on
   sensor data. Only the sensing devices primarily used in agriculture
   applications will be discussed in this review. The prominent
   technologies and methods used in agriculture will be explored with
   regard to research and development ever held in agricultural sensing
   devices for measuring soil parameters. These elementary methods of
   determining the soil parameters may be grouped into two classes:
   conventional and emerging. We expect this review to guide the
   researchers and provide an approach to the study related to producing a
   convenient, affordable, and efficient soil NPK detection sensor.},

   Precision Agriculture},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The use of precision agriculture is becoming more and more necessary to
   provide food for the world's growing population, as well as to reduce
   environmental impact and enhance the usage of limited natural resources.
   One of the main drawbacks that hinder the use of precision agriculture
   is the cost of technological immersion in the sector. For farmers, it is
   necessary to provide low-cost and robust systems as well as reliability.
   Toward this end, this paper presents a wireless sensor network of
   low-cost sensor nodes for soil moisture that can help farmers optimize
   the irrigation processes in precision agriculture. Each wireless node is
   composed of four soil moisture sensors that are able to measure the
   moisture at different depths. Each sensor is composed of two coils wound
   onto a plastic pipe. The sensor operation is based on mutual induction
   between coils that allow monitoring the percentage of water content in
   the soil. Several prototypes with different features have been tested.
   The prototype that has offered better results has a winding ratio of 1:2
   with 15 and 30 spires working at 93 kHz. We also have developed a
   specific communication protocol to improve the performance of the whole
   system. Finally, the wireless network was tested, in a real, cultivated
   plot of citrus trees, in terms of coverage and received signal strength
   indicator (RSSI) to check losses due to vegetation.},

   account for the spatial variability in the lambda-theta relationship

   spatial variability of theta across scales and to develop an empirical
   equation that can correct for the changes in the theta spatial
   variability observed at different spatial resolutions. In addition, the
   number of required samples to accurately characterize theta and its
   variability over scales ranging from 5 m and 350 m were estimated. These
   findings provide key information to scale soil moisture from centimeters

Title = {Fiber optic soil water content sensor for precision farming},
Journal = {OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {149},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel and cost effective fiber optic platform
   for the continuous monitoring of soil water content to be exploited in
   the agri-food sector and, in particular, in the field of precision
   agriculture to promote the rational use of water resources. The proposed
   platform arises from the judicious connection of optical fiber
   technology and functional materials able to exhibit a change in their
   optical properties depending on the water content in the environment.
   Al2O3 disks have been used as functional materials, taking advantage of
   their capability to absorb water and exhibit a correlated absorbance
   increase in the wavelength range corresponding to the absorption peak of
   water. A detailed study has been carried out to obtain the best coupling
   conditions between optical fibers and the functional disk. The final
   prototype has been tested directly in soil and the collected results
   show its capability to detect soil water content variation in the range
   0-35\% of volumetric water content (VWC) with a sensitivity of
   2.3\%/\%VWC and a VWC resolution lower than 1\%. Such performances allow
   the proposed device to be used for soil water content measurements for
   applications in several fields and in different hydrogeological
   conditions, such as, e.g., in smart farming applications, to support
   farmers in defining a correct irrigation strategy, or for the real-time
   monitoring of hydrogeological hazard, to prevent rainfall-induced
   landslide. Moreover, thanks to the capability of optical fibers
   technology to multiplex different fiber probes while sharing the same
   interrogation equipment, the proposed platform is endowed with
   multiplexing capabilities and presents a solid basis for a continuous
   monitoring of soil moisture monitoring over large areas.},

Abstract = {Water shortages have increasingly become a global issue due to the
   acceleration of climate change. The consumption of freshwater can be
   reduced to a minimum using water irrigation techniques that are based on
   conservative methods. For example, one of these is precision irrigation,
   or PI, which uses advanced digital technology to regulate the amount of
   water used. The aim is to use the least amount of water necessary for a
   given purpose. This approach keeps consumption to a minimum while the
   amount remains effective for its purpose. It is also important to note
   that the variability which occurs in soil and crops will create
   different types of conditions. These different conditions will need to
   be studied so as to determine the correct and adequate dynamics for a
   water management approach that is efficient. In this study, three
   investigation methods were developed and compared. The first evaluation
   was performed on outputs from the geoelectric reading of Automatic
   Resistivity Profiling (ARP). A second evaluation was performed in real
   time via a sensor network placed in the soil for the duration of two
   growing seasons of two different crops. The last evaluation was carried
   out by using maps of spectral indices obtained by the Sentinel 2
   satellites. The correlations between the three methods were evaluated to
   verify if satellite information may have significant potential in the
   use of water management in varying conditions. From the results
   obtained, some correlations have been found from the observations of the
   three systems under study. This has given a positive input towards using
   satellite maps which are integrated with simplified proximal sensor
   networks. The outcome of this technique can improve the efficiency of
   how to manage water distribution on cultivated land.},

Abstract = {The Korea Land Data Assimilation System (KLDAS) has been established for
   agricultural drought (i.e. soil moisture deficit) monitoring in South
   Korea, running the Noah-MP land surface model within the NASA Land
   Information System (LIS) framework with the added value of local
   precipitation forcing dataset and soil texture maps. KLDAS soil moisture
   is benchmarked against three global products: the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network
   (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the European Space
   Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) satellite product. The
   evaluation is performed using in situ measurements for 2013-2015 and one
   month standardized precipitation index (SPI-1) for 1982-2016, focusing
   on four major river basins in South Korea. The KLDAS outperforms all
   benchmark products in capturing soil moisture states and variability at
   a basin scale. Compared to GLDAS and FLDAS products, the EAS CCI product
   is not feasible for long term agricultural monitoring due to lower data
   quality for early periods (1979-1991) of soil moisture estimates. KLDAS
   shows that the most recent 2015 drought event leads to highest drought
   areas in the Han and Geum River basins in the past 35 years. This work
   supports KLDAS as an effective agricultural drought monitoring system to

Journal = {APPLIED AND ENVIRONMENTAL SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Soil nutrient balance is affected by nutrient management in crops. A
   poor nutrient management technique results in an imbalance in the soil
   nutrient status which could have a long-term negative impact on crop
   production. The current study was carried out to assess the effect of
   different rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on
   soil nutrient balance in a maize-wheat cropping system in Cambisols of
   Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal during 2019/20 and 2020/21. The experiment
   included three-factor randomized complete block design with three doses
   of each N, P, and K which was replicated three times. There was a
   remarkable change in soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N, P,
   and K contents of soil over a period of time with the application of
   different doses of NPK. Soil pH changed from 5.98 to 5.53, SOC increased
   from 11.7 to 16.8 g center dot kg(-1), total N decreased from 1264 to
   1177 mg center dot kg(,)(-1) available P2O5 declined from 214 to 63.6 mg
   center dot kg(,)(-1) and available K2O decreased from 71.7 to 24.8 mg
   center dot kg(-1) with varying rates of NPK after four cropping seasons.
   Furthermore, partial, apparent, and net N, P, K balance were
   predominantly negative in all the fertilizer treatments, but the
   magnitude was lower under higher nutrient rates and positive partial N
   balance was noticed in higher N levels. The depletion of native P and K
   pools even at higher application rates was attributed to higher crop
   removal over time as compared to inputs. Therefore, continuous
   application of balanced fertilizers is crucial in maintaining the
   fertility of soil and productivity of crops.},

Abstract = {Air-drying process of soil is a crucial procedure in geological and
   geotechnical engineering. Drying-induced ground subsidence and damage to
   overlying buildings is a widespread and urgent problem. Monitoring of
   drying-induced water evaporation in soil is of great importance. In this
   paper, soil moisture loss monitoring based on lead zirconate titanate
   (PZT) transducer using electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique was
   investigated. A physical model test in our laboratory was conducted to
   study the feasibility and applicability. In the experimental research,
   three identical PZT transducers that were wrapped with waterproof
   insulation glue were pre-embedded inside a cohesive soil specimen. In
   addition, another PZT transducer was embedded in a sandy soil specimen
   to explore the application effect in soil with different composition.
   EMI signatures of these four PZT patches during the air-drying process
   were collected and analyzed. Experimental results indicated that the
   peak frequency in the conductance signatures presented a rightward shift
   as the water evaporates. Moreover, the corresponding peak magnitude keep
   decreasing with the continuous development of soil moisture loss. To
   better quantify the variations, two statistical metrics including root
   mean square deviation (RMSD) and mean absolute percentage deviation
   (MAPD) were employed to study the changing characteristics of the EMI
   signatures. All these two metrics increase coincidentally in the
   process. Experimental results demonstrate that cohesive and sandy soil
   moisture loss monitoring by using the embedded PZT transducer is
   feasible and reliable. This work also serves as a proof-of-concept study
   to demonstrate the performance of the EMI technique in monitoring the
   soil moisture content.},

Title = {Toward Large-Scale Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Rail-Based Cosmic Ray
   Neutron Sensing},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {59},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil
   water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale
   average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and
   continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC
   patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel
   concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine
   the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data
   processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This
   study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first
   of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data
   recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an similar to 9 km
   railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train,
   supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric
   methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent
   spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily
   resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface
   features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway
   segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were
   related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC
   mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of
   environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne
   CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC
   monitoring for larger scales (<= 10-km), with the additional benefit of
   providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily
   resolution.},

   Soil Moisture},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {The recently developed OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) has been
   successfully applied for watershed scale soil moisture (SM) estimation
   based on remotely sensed shortwave infrared (SWIR) transformed
   reflectance (TRSWIR) and the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI). This study is aimed at the evaluation of OPTRAM for field scale
   precision agriculture applications using ultrahigh spatial resolution
   optical observations obtained with one of the world's largest field
   robotic phenotyping scanners located in Maricopa, Arizona. We replaced
   NDVI with the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which has been
   shown to be more accurate for cropped agricultural fields that
   transition from bare soil to dense vegetation cover. The OPTRAM was
   parameterized based on the trapezoidal geometry of the pixel
   distribution within the TRSWIR-SAVI space, from which wet- and dry-edge
   parameters were determined. The accuracy of the resultant SM estimates
   is evaluated based on a comparison with ground reference measurements
   obtained with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors deployed to
   monitor surface, near-surface and root zone SM. The obtained results
   indicate an SM estimation error between 0.045 and 0.057 cm(3) cm(-3) for
   the near-surface and root zone, respectively. The high resolution SM
   maps clearly capture the spatial SM variability at the sensor locations.
   These findings and the presented framework can be applied in conjunction
   with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) observations to assist with farm scale
   precision irrigation management to improve water use efficiency of
   cropping systems and conserve water in water-limited regions of the
   world.},

Abstract = {A smart sensor label based on the integration of ultra high frequency
   (UHF) radio frequency identification (RFID) technology and sensors is
   presented. The label is composed of a semi-active system that measures
   temperature, light, relative humidity and gravimetric water content
   (GWC) in the soil. The deployed system provides a simple, cost effective
   solution to monitor and control the growing of plants in modern
   agriculture and is intended be a part of a smart wireless sensor network
   (WSN) for agricultural monitoring. This paper is focused on analysis and
   development of a moisture sensor to measure GWC. It is based on a
   capacitance measurement solution, the accuracy of which is enhanced
   using several sensor driving frequencies. Thanks to the cancellation of
   supply voltage variations, the modeling of the GWC sensor and readout
   circuit was correct. The results we measured were close to modeled
   values. The maximum measurement resolution of the capacitive moisture
   sensor was 0.07 pF. To get the GWC from measured capacitance, a scale
   was used to weigh the mass of water in the soil. The comparison between
   capacitance measurement and calculated soil GWC is presented. The RFID
   measurement system has energy harvesting capabilities and an ultra-low
   power microcontroller, which uses embedded software to control the
   measurement properties. The microcontroller has to choose the
   appropriate model depending on the measured amplitude and chosen
   frequency to calculate the actual voltage on the sensing capacitor.},

Abstract = {Readily available moisture in the root zone is very important for
   optimum plant growth. The available techniques to determine soil
   moisture content have practical limitations owing to their high cost,
   dependence on labor, and time consumption. We have developed a prototype
   for automated soil moisture monitoring using a low-cost capacitive soil
   moisture sensor (SKU:SEN0193) for data acquisition, connected to the
   internet. A soil-specific calibration was performed to integrate the
   sensor with the automated soil moisture monitoring system. The accuracy
   of the soil moisture measurements was compared with those of a
   gravimetric method and a well-established soil moisture sensor (SM-200,
   Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The root-mean-square error (RMSE)
   of the soil water contents obtained with the SKU:SEN0193 sensor
   function, the SM-200 manufacturer's function, and the SM-200
   soil-specific calibration function were 0.09, 0.07, and 0.06 cm(3)

   resonance frequencies of the antenna due to changes in the relative
   permittivity of the material under test (MUT). The sensor's sensitivity
   was thoroughly examined and compared with various sensors documented in

Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Abstract = {Surface water availability and its temperature are fundamental factors
   in describing the characteristics of land surface properties. In this
   study, a new temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) to quantify
   surface soil moisture (SSM) is proposed. It is defined as a function of
   land surface temperature variation and its relationship to surface water
   availability. The spatial pattern of TMDI has been analyzed over two
   time points of dry and rainy seasons for the plain area of Tainan,
   Taiwan, using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared
   Sensor (TIRS) image acquired on January 20 and October 19, 2014. The
   effectiveness of TMDI in reflecting the SSM status was then evaluated by
   the results of the simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and verified by the
   near-surface air temperature (T-air) and humidity (RHair) measured by
   the ground-based weather stations. The results indicated that TMDI
   exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the simulated ET and
   positive correlation with in situ measured T-air from seven stations (r
   = -0.95 and -0.9 for simulated ET and r = 0.94 and 0.78 for T-air
   corresponding to January 20 and October 19, respectively). We further
   compared the performance of the TMDI with the existing remotely sensed
   dryness assessment methods, including temperature vegetation dryness
   index (TVDI) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL)
   model. The advantages of the TMDI in reflecting SSM, especially in the
   nonvegetation area, are clearly demonstrated. It is concluded that the
   TMDI is a reliable indicator for determining the SSM status with a large
   degree of freedom for further applications since it does not require any
   other ground-based measurements.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT},

Volume = {72},
Abstract = {There are many problems with agricultural technology around the world,
   such as extensive irrigation which causes the waste of water. To
   significantly improve the efficiency of irrigation water, an antenna
   sensor, with high sensitivity and wide range, is proposed to measure the
   soil water content (SWC) wirelessly. When the SWC changes, the resonant
   frequency of the antenna will shift. By reading the resonant frequency
   of the antenna sensor, the SWC can be measured and transmitted
   wirelessly. The antenna sensor has a wider detection range of SWC,
   ranging from 10\% to 44\%, and a novel metamaterial structure
   electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) is designed and its function in improving
   sensitivity is verified. Furthermore, by sputtering 60-nm-thick SiO2
   film on the surface of the antenna patch, its sensitivity has also been
   greatly improved. When the SiO(2 )film is sputtered on the antenna
   sensor, its sensitivity is 7.2 MHz/\% and 7.6 MHz/\% when the SWC is
   10\%-29\% and 30\%-44\%, respectively. In summary, this work contributes

Title = {A Spatial Downscaling Method for Remote Sensing Soil Moisture Based on
   Random Forest Considering Soil Moisture Memory and Mass Conservation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Remote sensing soil moisture (SM) has been widely used in various earth
   science studies and applications, but their low resolution limits their
   usage and downscaling of them is needed. In this study, we proposed a
   spatial downscaling method for SM based on random forest considering
   soil moisture memory and mass conservation to improve downscaling
   performance. The lagged SM was added as a predictor to represent soil
   moisture memory, in addition to the regular predictors in previous
   downscaling studies. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM data of
   the Pearl River Basin were used to test our downscaling method. The
   results show that the downscaling model obtained good performance on the
   test set (R-2 = 0.848, ubRMSE = 0.034 m(3)/m(3) and Bias = 0.008
   m(3)/m(3)). The spatial and temporal performance of the RF downscaling
   model can be improved by adding lagged SM variables. Downscaled data
   obtained can retain the information of the original SMAP SM data well
   and show more spatial details, and mass conservation correction is
   considered to be useful to eliminate systematic bias of the downscaling
   model. Downscaled SM achieved acceptable performance in in situ
   validation, though it was inevitably limited by the performance of the
   original SMAP data. The proposed downscaling method can serve as a
   powerful tool for the development of high-resolution SM information.},

Abstract = {Using optical remote sensing data to downscale microwave soil moisture
   is currently a crucial technique for producing fine-resolution soil

   downscaling models are mainly developed and evaluated in arid or

   improve soil moisture estimates under a wide range of climate regimes,
   this study developed a nonlinear enhanced soil moisture downscaling
   model and evaluated it at a typical microwave resolution over the
   contiguous China. The enhanced model clearly outperforms the
   conventional approach in estimating surface soil moisture by reducing
   the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.175 vol/vol to 0.075 vol/vol
   under wet climate. Finally, soil moisture downscaling is conducted by
   applying such models (built at the 25-km scale) at a finer (1-km)
   resolution. Validation result of downscaled soil moisture against in
   situ data set demonstrates the advantage of the enhanced model.},

Abstract = {The ability to accurately obtain soil moisture contents is important in
   many different fields, including agriculture and branches of civil
   engineering including hydraulics, transportation, and geotechnical
   engineering. The moisture content of pavement subgrade affects pavement
   performance. Long-term monitoring the moisture content of subgrade can
   allow for better pavement design and maintenance practices. Collecting
   soil samples for gravimetric testing is time consuming and destructive,
   which is not practical for long-term monitoring. Soil moisture sensors
   employing a variety of technologies have been developed for recording
   soil moisture contents non-destructively and remotely. Soils that are
   exposed to irrigation or sea waters can have varying amounts of
   salinity. Salinity in the soil can adversely affect the performance of
   various sensor technologies. This review paper summarizes the
   difficulties associated with the use of commonly used, commercially
   available soil moisture sensors using time domain reflectometry (TDR),
   capacitance, impedance, time domain transmission (TDT), and transmission
   line oscillator technology.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Actively heated fiber Bragg grating (AH-FBG) can perform
   quasi-distributed monitoring of soil water content. However, the
   analysis method needs to be improved to minimize measuring errors. In
   this study, the artificial intelligence method is proposed and a model
   test was used to verify its feasibility and to explore the influence of
   cover conditions. Three cover layers were considered, including bare
   soil (S), grass (G), and biochar mixed soil (B). The water content
   measurements based on maximum temperature increase have higher accuracy
   for G, followed by S, and the worst is B. Fluctuation in the heat power
   and the longitudinal heat transfer are the main sources of errors.
   Artificial neural network (ANN) models can effectively improve
   monitoring accuracy. Cover conditions have a significant influence on
   the measurements by affecting initial ground temperatures and water
   content gradients. For field monitoring, the cover layer should be
   considered when analyzing AH-FBG measurements.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   interference signal has gained wide interests in recent years. It
   utilizes the variation pattern of the routinely measured Signal-to-Noise
   Ratio (SNR) that contains the interference information between the
   direct and soil reflected signal. Previous studies have shown that the
   amplitude of the de-trended SNR data is not a good indicator for soil
   moisture variation. The possible cause found in this study is that the
   de-trending operation only reduces the additive direct signal component
   in the SNR data, while the multiplicative direct signal component in the
   amplitude of SNR data is unaffected. Therefore, a method is proposed to
   reduce the contamination of the direct signal component on the amplitude
   through signal reconstruction and then normalization. Experiment data
   are collected and processed to calculate the normalized amplitude based
   on the reconstruction method. The results show that the overall
   correlation coefficient of the normalized amplitude with in-situ soil
   moisture reaches to 0.6966 under highly rough surface condition, while
   it is only 0.4314 for the amplitude obtained from the conventional
   method. A quadratic model is used to retrieve soil moisture from the
   normalized amplitude, the retrieval error is less than 0.085 cm(3)
   cm(-3).},

Abstract = {Low-power wireless stand-alone sensors that can operate without any
   wiring have received significant attention in sensor network
   applications. These devices harvest environmental energy resources to
   supply their power and transfer their collected data using wireless RF
   links. In many instances, the power supplied from the environment is far
   less than the power required by the sensor device. In this case, the
   main solution is to accumulate energy on a storage element, and when
   enough energy is stored, the sensor node is instantaneously activated
   using an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. During this short time
   burst, the sensor performs the required acquisition, transmits the
   results, and enters a sleep mode until again enough energy is collected.
   The quiescent current of the UVLO is the main factor that determines the
   minimum power level at which the sensor node is still operational. Most
   wake-up circuits used in conventional devices suffer from a quiescent
   current of a few hundred nanoamperes. In this article, using a
   zero-bias-current MOSFET-based approach, a new wake-up circuitry is
   presented, which lowers the quiescent current down to the picoampere
   range. As a practical application, the effectiveness of the proposed
   circuit is shown in the soil moisture monitoring sensor setup.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a non-invasive tool for measuring
   hydrogen pools such as soil moisture, snow or vegetation. The intrinsic
   integration over a radial hectare-scale footprint is a clear advantage
   for averaging out small-scale heterogeneity, but on the other hand the
   data may become hard to interpret in complex terrain with patchy land
   use. This study presents a directional shielding approach to prevent
   neutrons from certain angles from being counted while counting neutrons
   entering the detector from other angles and explores its potential to
   gain a sharper horizontal view on the surrounding soil moisture
   distribution. Using the Monte Carlo code URANOS (Ultra Rapid
   Neutron-Only Simulation), we modelled the effect of additional
   polyethylene shields on the horizontal field of view and assessed its
   impact on the epithermal count rate, propagated uncertainties and
   aggregation time. The results demonstrate that directional CRNS
   measurements are strongly dominated by isotropic neutron transport,
   which dilutes the signal of the targeted direction especially from the
   far field. For typical count rates of customary CRNS stations,
   directional shielding of half-spaces could not lead to acceptable
   precision at a daily time resolution. However, the mere statistical
   distinction of two rates should be feasible.},

   Laboratory test studies have shown that the capillary tube with a low

Title = {A Pixel-Scale Measurement Method of Soil Moisture Using
   Ground-Penetrating Radar},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ground validation of remote sensing soil moisture requires ground
   measurements corresponding to the pixel scale. To date, there is still a
   lack of simple, fast and reasonable methods for soil moisture
   measurement at pixel scale between point measurements and remote sensing
   observations. In this study, a measurement method of soil moisture using
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was proposed for pixel scale. We used a
   PulseEKKOTM PRO GPR system with 250 MHz antennas to measure soil
   moisture by Fixed Offset (FO) method in four 30 x 30 m(2) plots chosen
   from the desert steppe. This study used a random combination method to
   analyze soil moisture measurements acquired by different numbers of GPR
   survey lines. The results showed that two survey lines of GPR would be
   sufficient under confidence level of 90\% with the relative error of
   7\%, and four survey lines of GPR would be eligible under confidence
   level of 95\% with the relative error of 5\% for each plot. GPR
   measurement can reproduce the spatial distribution of soil moisture with
   higher resolution and smaller error, especially when two and four survey
   lines are designed in cross shape and grid shape, respectively. The
   method was applied to ground validation for the soil moisture from
   Landsat 8, showing the advantages of stable relative errors, less
   contingency and reliable evaluation when compared to point measurements.
   This method is fast and convenient and not limited to a certain pixel,
   and thus largely benefits the scale matching of remote sensing results
   and field measurements in ground validation.},

Abstract = {Agricultural land in the south of Iraq provides habitat for several
   types of living creatures. This land has a significant impact on the
   ecosystem. The agricultural land of Al-Hawizeh marsh covers an area of
   more than 3500 km(2)and is considered an enriched resource to produce
   several harvests. A total of 74\% of this area suffers from a high
   degree of salinity and chemical pollution, which needs to be remedied.
   Several human-made activities and post-war-related events have caused
   radical deterioration in soil quality in the agricultural land. The goal
   of this research was to integrate mathematical models, remote sensing
   data, and GIS to provide a powerful tool to predict, assess, monitor,
   manage, and map the salinity and chemical parameters of iron (Fe), lead
   (Pb), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and zinc (Zn) in the soils of
   agricultural land in Al-Hawizeh marsh in southern Iraq during the four
   seasons of 2017. The mathematical model consists of four parts. The
   first depends on the B6 and B11 bands of Landsat-8, to calculate the
   soil moisture index (SMI). The second is the salinity equation (SE),
   which depends on the SMI result to retrieve the salinity values from
   Landsat-8 images. The third part depends on the B6 and B7 bands of
   Landsat-8, which calculates the clay chemical index (CCIs). The fourth
   part is the chemical equation (CE), which depends on the CCI to retrieve
   the chemical values (Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) from Landsat-8 images. The
   average salinity concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and
   winter were 1175, 1010, 1105, and 1789 mg/dm(3), respectively. The
   average Fe concentrations during autumn, summer, spring and winter were
   813, 784, 842, and 1106 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Pb
   concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 4.85,
   3.79, 4.74, and 7.2 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Cu
   concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 3.9, 3.1,
   4.45, and 7.5 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Cr concentrations
   during autumn, summer, spring, and winter seasons were 1.28, 0.73, 1.03,
   and 2.91 mg/dm(3), respectively. Finally, the average Zn concentrations
   during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 8.25, 6, 7.05, and 12
   mg/dm(3), respectively. The results show that the concentrations of
   salinity and chemicals decreased in the summer and increased in the
   winter. The decision tree (DT) classification depended on the output
   results for salinity and chemicals for both SE and CE equations. This
   classification refers to all the parameters simultaneously in one stage.
   The output of DT classification results can display all the soil quality
   parameters (salinity, Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) in one image. This
   approach was repeated for each season in this study. In conclusion, the
   developed systematic and generic approach may constitute a basis for
   determining soil quality parameters in agricultural land worldwide.},

Abstract = {Drought is the costliest disaster around the world and in China as well.
   Northeastern China is one of China's most important major grain
   producing areas. Frequent droughts have harmed the agriculture of this
   region and further threatened national food security. Therefore, the
   timely and effective monitoring of drought is extremely important. In
   this study, the passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture data,
   i.e., the SMOS soil moisture (SMOS-SM) product, was compared to several
   in situ meteorological indices through Pearson correlation analysis to
   assess the performance of SMOS-SM in monitoring drought in northeastern
   China. Then, maps based on SMOS-SM and in situ indices were created for
   July from 2010 to 2015 to identify the spatial pattern of drought
   distributions. Our results showed that the SMOS-SM product had
   relatively high correlation with in situ indices, especially SPI and
   SPEI values of a nine-month scale for the growing season. The drought
   patterns shown on maps generated from SPI-9, SPEI-9 and sc-PDSI were
   also successfully captured using the SMOS-SM product. We found that the
   SMOS-SM product effectively monitored drought patterns in northeastern
   China, and this capacity would be enhanced when field capacity

   water-saving irrigation benefits, which are usually used for scheduling
   irrigation. The overall score of M4 in different soil types was 0.2\%
   lower than that of M5. Farms with reasonable economic conditions and a
   high awareness scored 5.3\% higher on technology than those with modest

Abstract = {The identification of drought-sensitive areas (DSAs) in floodplain
   Fluvisols of high textural pedodiversity is crucial for sustainable land
   management purposes. During extended drought periods moisture
   replenishment is only available by capillary rise from the groundwater.
   However, moisture flux is often hindered by capillary barriers in the
   interface between layers of contrasting textures. The results of
   HYDRUS-1D simulations run on multilayered soil profiles were integrated
   into textural maps to determine the spatial distribution of water
   dynamics on the floodplain of the Drava River (SW Hungary). Model runs
   and field data revealed limited moisture replenishment by capillary rise
   when both contrasting textural interfaces and sandy layers are present
   in the profile. By implementing these textural and hydraulic relations,
   a drought vulnerability map (DSA map) of the operational area of the Old
   Drava Programme (ODP) was developed. According to the spatial
   distribution of soils of reduced capillary rise, 52\% of the ODP area is
   likely threatened by droughts. Our model results are adaptable for
   optimisation of land- and water-management practices along the
   floodplains of low-energy and medium-sized rivers under humid
   continental and maritime climates.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {24},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {On the way from the Internet of things (IoT) to the Internet of
   underground things (IoUT) the main challenge is antenna design. The
   enabling technologies still rely on simple design and low cost, but the
   systems are more complex. The LoRa-based system combined with a machine
   learning approach can be used for the estimation of soil moisture by
   using signal strength data, but for the improvement of the system
   performance we propose the optimization of the antenna for underground
   use. The soil properties are frequency-dependent and varying in time,
   which may cause variations in the signal wavelength and input impedance
   of the antenna underground. Instead of using wideband antenna design or
   standard helical antenna provided in LoRa module, which are typical in
   the IoUT research community for communication links, we propose a
   narrow-band antenna design for the application in soil moisture sensing.
   It is shown that the approach of simply matching the antenna buried in
   dry sand can provide a substantial signal level difference, ranging from
   approximately 10 dB (achieved by proof-of-concept measurements) to as
   much as 40 dB (calculated by a full wave simulator) in reflection
   coefficient when the moisture content is being increased by 20\%. This
   can ensure more reliable radio sensing in novel sensorless technology
   where soil moisture information is extracted from the signal strength of
   a transmitting device.},

Title = {Soil Moisture Inversion Based on Data Augmentation Method Using
   Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important land environment characteristic that
   connects agriculture, ecology, and hydrology. Surface soil moisture
   (SSM) prediction can be used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality,
   manage water resources, and estimate agricultural production.
   Multi-source remote sensing is a crucial tool for assessing SSM in
   agricultural areas. The field-measured SSM sample data are required in
   model building and accuracy assessment of SSM inversion using remote
   sensing data. When the SSM samples are insufficient, the SSM inversion
   accuracy is severely affected. An SSM inversion method suitable for a
   small sample size was proposed. The alpha approximation method was
   employed to expand the measured SSM samples to offer more training data
   for SSM inversion models. Then, feature parameters were extracted from
   Sentinel-1 microwave and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and
   optimized using three methods, which were Pearson correlation analysis,
   random forest (RF), and principal component analysis. Then, three common
   machine learning models suitable for small sample training, which were
   RF, support vector regression, and genetic algorithm-back propagation
   neural network, were built to retrieve SSM. Comparison experiments were
   carried out between various feature optimization methods and machine
   learning models. The experimental results showed that after sample
   augmentation, SSM inversion accuracy was enhanced, and the combination
   of utilizing RF for feature screening and RF for SSM inversion had a
   higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7256, a root
   mean square error of 0.0539 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error of
   0.0422 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed method was finally used
   to invert the regional SSM of the study area. The inversion results
   indicated that the proposed method had good performance in regional
   applications with a small sample size.},

Abstract = {An environmental sensor (the Decagon 5TE sensor with an EM50 data
   logger) is a soil salinity, temperature and water content (SWC) sensor
   that can be used by researchers and farmers around the world. Herein, 22
   sensors were tested under different conditions of soil salinity,
   temperature, organic matter, texture, clay content, bulk density and
   water content, ranging from normal to extreme. The results indicated
   that the main issue with this device is that its SWC determinations are
   only accurate within a limited soil salinity and temperature range.
   Conversely, the organic matter, texture, clay content and bulk density
   have no direct impact on the sensors' accuracy. The sensors work best
   when the soil salinity and temperature are 2.5 dS m(-1) and 25 degrees
   C, respectively. This sensor can be used appropriately after calibration
   when the soil salinity and temperatures are within the 1.9-4.0 dS m(-1)
   and 16-30 degrees C ranges, respectively. When the soil salinity and
   temperature values are higher or lower than these ranges, the sensors do
   not work accurately. More investigation is needed to study the
   effectiveness of the sensors under high values of soil salinity and

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in the partitioning of rainfall
   into evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff, hence a vital state
   variable in hydrological modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of
   soil moisture in space, most existing in situ observation networks
   rarely provide sufficient coverage to capture the catchment-scale soil
   moisture variations. Clearly, there is a need to develop a systematic
   approach for soil moisture network design, so that with the minimal
   number of sensors the catchment spatial soil moisture information could
   be captured accurately. In this study, a simple and low-data requirement
   method is proposed. It is based on principal component analysis (PCA)
   for the investigation of the network redundancy degree and K-means
   cluster analysis (CA) and a selection of statistical criteria for the
   determination of the optimal sensor number and placements. Furthermore,
   the long-term (10-year) 5 km surface soil moisture datasets estimated
   through the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are
   used as the network design inputs. In the case of the Emilia-Romagna
   catchment, the results show the proposed network is very efficient in
   estimating the catchment-scale surface soil moisture (i.e. with NSE and
   r at 0.995 and 0.999, respectively, for the areal mean estimation; and
   0.973 and 0.990, respectively, for the areal standard deviation
   estimation). To retain 90 \% variance, a total of 50 sensors in a 22 124
   km(2) catchment is needed, and in comparison with the original number of
   WRF grids (828 grids), the designed network requires significantly fewer
   sensors. However, refinements and investigations are needed to further
   improve the design scheme, which are also discussed in the paper.},

Abstract = {One of the methods for irrigation scheduling is to use sensors to
   measure the soil moisture level in the plant root zone and apply water
   if there is a water shortage for the plants. The measurement accuracy
   and reliability of the soil moisture sensors are critical for
   sensor-based irrigation management. This study evaluated the measurement
   accuracy and repeatability of the EC-5 and 5TM soil volumetric water
   content (SVWC) sensors, the MPS-2 and 200SS soil water potential (SWP)
   sensors, and the 200TS soil temperature sensor. Six 183 cm x 183 cm x 71
   cm wooden compartments were built inside a greenhouse, and each
   compartment was filled with one type of soil from the Mississippi Delta.
   A total of 66 sensors with 18 data loggers were installed in the soil
   compartments to measure SVWC, SWP, and soil temperature. Soil samples
   were periodically collected from the compartments to determine SVWC
   using the gravimetric method. SVWC measured by the sensors was compared
   with that determined by the gravimetric method. The SVWC readings from
   the sensors had a linear regression relationship with the gravimetric
   SVWC (r(2) = 0.82). This relationship was used to calibrate the sensor
   readings. The SVWC and SWP sensors could detect the general trend of
   soil moisture changes. However, their measurements varied significantly
   among the sensors. To obtain accurate absolute soil moisture
   measurements, the sensors require individual and soil-specific
   calibration. The 5TM, MPS-2, and 200TS sensors performed well in soil
   temperature measurement tests. Individual temperature readings from
   these sensors were very close to the mean of all sensor readings.},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to test the capability of thermal remote
   sensing in monitoring waterlogged areas in Ismailia governorate based on
   surface soil moisture retrieval. Three landsat satellite images 5, 7 and
   8 (TM, ETM + and TIRS) were used for this purpose during three different
   dates (1998, 2008 and 2015). Soil moisture index (SMI) was produced
   based on calculated Land surface temperature (LST). Fifty five soil
   profiles have been dug to measure the depth of water tables of the study
   area. SMI Validation was carried out in 2015 using surface soil samples
   from the upper 5 cm in which actual moisture content was estimated.
   Digital change detection techniques for SMI were applied in order to
   monitor the change in the surface soil moisture along two time periods
   (1998-2008), (2008-2015). The results indicated that the spatio-temporal
   variations of soil moisture content are associated with soil texture,
   landuse/landcover, soil elevation and water table levels. Correlation
   between actual and retrieved soil moisture revealed a moderate
   correlation relationship with R-2 = 0.61. Furthermore, an increase of
   water table eastern the study area. Also the results illustrated the
   increasing of water table is a direct relation with soil moisture. In
   addition, an increase in the surface soil moisture (SSM) recognized in
   22.06\% of the study area from 1998 to 2008 while, 40.55\% of the area
   showed an increased in the SSM from 2008 to 2015. This continuous
   increase in the SSM could be prone to the increasing agricultural
   expansion and water table levels which, led to conversion of sabkhas to
   water bodies and fish farms. SMI could be an effective tool in mapping
   waterlogged areas.},

Abstract = {The paper studies the application of mathematical modelling of moisture

   propose a novel modelling framework aimed at solving the problem of

   the problem of predicting the dynamics of soil moisture content is
   studied on the base of the two-dimensional Richards' equation stated in
   terms of water head. The values of model's parameters are identified
   using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The ability to assess
   the reliability and accuracy of measurements was tested by studying
   deviations of the simulated values from Watermark sensor readings along
   with the variations within the growing season and between several
   seasons of identified values of model's parameters that can serve as
   indirect indicators of changes in soil structure. The results of
   computational experiments prove the stability of the considered
   technique to the amount of initial data and to the level of potential

Abstract = {In this study, the phenological behavior and energy balance of plants
   are used as a sensory mechanism for root-zone soil moisture monitoring
   using both in-situ and satellite remote sensing data. The commonly used
   in-situ measurements are not feasible for mapping soil moisture at
   large-scale agricultural areas. Local direct root-zone soil moisture
   measurements cannot be reliably interpolated owing to the high spatial
   variability of soil structure and the vegetative content. Remote sensing
   methods are negatively affected by vegetation coverage and density
   regarding penetration and backscattering characteristics. In order to
   overcome these limitations, we propose a root-zone soil moisture
   estimation method utilizing a context-aware data clustering process,
   which can be applied prior to any statistical analysis, for empirical
   evaluation of data. In this aspect, the crops' phenological stages and
   soil-air temperature differences are defined as the two contexts for
   data clustering. Parameters such as canopy-air temperature difference,
   land surface temperature, and solar radiation with respect to plant
   energy and water processes are used for the analysis. The proposed model
   is utilized using piecewise linear regression of data obtained from 16
   rainfed wheat parcels distributed across Turkey, under different
   climatic and topographic conditions. It is shown that the proposed
   context-aware data clustering process enables the nonlinear plant
   behavior to be analyzed linearly. The correlation value of the whole
   season increased from 21\% to a range between 78\% and 95\% for
   different clusters. The outliers became relevant and the parameters
   became significant after the proposed context-aware data clustering.},

   from the calcareous soil of Nasr Abad village of Gorgan, Iran. The ratio
   of rice bran husk flour to G0 as improving hydraulic properties was 1:2,
   1:5, 1: 10, 1:15, and 1:20 (kg of rice bran to kg of air-dried soil).
   The produced clay capsules were named G2, G5, G10, G15, and G20
   respectively. The water discharge and soil water distribution of clay
   capsules were measured at 10, 25, 50, 80, and 100 kPa of hydrostatic
   pressures with a discharge-pressure automation instrument. The findings
   revealed a positive and significant relationship between increasing
   organic matter levels and the discharge of porous clay capsules. Unlike
   in G2 and G5, the relationship between discharges and hydrostatic
   pressure is linear in G10, G15, and G20. Meanwhile, the soil wetting
   shape followed a spherical trend due to the slow seepage of clay
   capsules. However, the soil-wetting shapes in G10, G15, and G20 were
   spherical and trended to vertical ellipsoids in G5 and G2. This method
   is of high importance for irrigating plants, especially in arid and
   semi-arid regions, and can efficiently manage the water shortage
   problem.},

Abstract = {The understanding of land surface-atmosphere energy exchange is
   extremely important for predicting climate change and weather impacts,
   particularly the influence of soil moisture content (SMC) on
   hydrometeorological and ecological processes, which are also linked to
   human activities. Unfortunately, traditional measurement methods are
   expensive and cumbersome over large areas, whereas measurements from
   satellite active and passive microwave sensors have shown advantages for
   SMC monitoring. Since the launch of the first passive microwave
   satellite in 1978, more and more progresses have been made in monitoring
   SMC from satellites, e.g., the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP)
   and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions in the last decade.
   Recently, new methods using signals of opportunity have been emerging,
   highlighting the Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry
   (GNSS-R), which has wide applications in Earth's surface remote sensing
   due to its numerous advantages (e.g., revisiting time, global coverage,
   low cost, all-weather measurements, and near real-time) when compared to
   the conventional observations. In this paper, a detailed review on the

Abstract = {Monitoring changes in soil saturation is important for slope stability

   development of a system, called LAMP, for the monitoring, analysis and
   forecasting of slides triggered by rainfalls. Multiple installations
   (along vertical alignments) of WaterScout sensors are placed in the
   nodes of the monitoring network. They provide real-time water content
   profiles in the shallow layers (typically in the upper meter) of a
   slope. With particular reference to these measurements, the present
   paper describes the reliability analysis of the instruments, the

Abstract = {Abrupt onset and swift intensification characterize flash droughts.
   Global surface soil moisture (theta(RS)) from NASA's Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) satellite can facilitate a near-real-time
   assessment of emerging flash droughts at a 36-km footprint. However, a
   robust flash drought monitoring using theta(RS) must account for the (a)
   short observation record of SMAP, (b) nonlinear geophysical controls
   over theta(RS) dynamics, and (c) emergent meteorological drivers of
   flash droughts. We propose a new method for near-real-time
   characterization of droughts using Soil Moisture Stress (SMS, drought
   stress) and Relative Rate of Drydown (RRD, drought stress
   intensification rate)-developed using SMAP theta(RS) (March 2015-May
   2021), footprint-scale seasonal soil water retention parameters and
   land-atmospheric coupling strength. SMS and RRD are nonlinearly combined
   to develop Flash Drought Stress Index (FDSI) to characterize emerging
   flash droughts (FDSI >= 0.71 for moderate to high RRD and SMS).
   Globally, FDSI shows a high correlation with concurrent meteorological
   anomalies. A mechanistic evaluation of flash droughts is presented for
   the Northern Great Plains, Central South Africa, and Eastern Australia
   using FDSI, SMS, and RRD. About 5.6\% of the earth's landmass
   experienced flash droughts of varying intensity and duration during
   2015-2021 (FDSI >= 0.71 for >30 consecutive days), majorly in global
   drylands. FDSI shows high skill in forecasting vegetation health with a
   lead of 0-2 weeks, with exceptions in irrigated croplands and mixed
   forests. With readily available parameters, low data latency, and no
   dependence on model simulations, we provide a robust tool for global
   near-real-time flash drought monitoring using SMAP.},

Abstract = {In gardening, particularly in golf courses, soil moisture management is
   critical for maximizing water efficiency. Remote sensing has been used
   to estimate soil moisture in recent years with relatively low
   accuracies. In this paper, we aim to use remote sensing and wireless
   sensor networks to generate soil moisture indexes for a golf course. In
   the golf course, we identified three types of soil, and data was
   gathered for three months. Mathematical models were obtained using data
   from Sentinel-2, bands with a resolution of 10 and 20 m, and sensed soil
   moisture. Models with acceptable accuracy were obtained only for one out
   of three soil types, the natural soil in which natural vegetation is
   grown. Two multiple regression models are presented with an R-2 of 0.46
   for bands at 10 m and 0.70 for bands at 20 m. Their mean absolute error
   was lower than 3\% in both cases. For the modified soils, the greens,
   and the golf course fairway, it was not feasible to obtain regression
   models due to the temporal uniformity of the grass and the range of
   variation of soil moisture. The developed moisture indexes were compared
   with existing options. The attained accuracies improve the current
   models. The verification indicates that the model generated with band 4
   and band 12 is the one with better accuracy.},

Abstract = {Moisture content is an important index that affects the physical and
   mechanical properties of geotechnical materials. Rapid and accurate
   monitoring of soil moisture distribution is of great significance for
   guiding engineering practice. At present, the heat source method for
   moisture monitoring requires high stability of heat source intensity. To
   reduce the requirement of heating power, a point heat source (PHS)
   method for soil moisture monitoring was proposed. This method uses the
   correlation between the thermal conductivity of soil and the moisture
   content, and indirectly identifies the moisture content by monitoring
   the cooling law of the PHS in soil, which can eliminate the influence of
   heat source intensity. Based on this idea, a mobile PHS system for soil
   moisture monitoring composed of a sensing-heating system and a
   monitoring tube was designed, which can solve the spatial resolution
   problem of fiber Bragg grating measurement system. Firstly, the system
   was used to carry out calibration tests on two different graded soil
   specimens with uniform moisture content. According to the cooling law of
   the heat source in porous medium, the discriminant index eta of moisture
   content was defined, and then the relationship between the volumetric
   water content theta and eta was established. Then the tests were carried
   out in the soil specimens with non-uniform moisture content, and a
   calibration relation established by the calibration tests was used to
   invert theta. The results were compared with those measured by drying
   method, thus verifying the feasibility of the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key hydrologic state variable that is of
   significant importance for numerous Earth and environmental science
   applications that directly impact the global environment and human
   society. Potential applications include, but are not limited to,

   Because of the importance and wide-ranging applicability of highly
   variable spatial and temporal SM information that links the water,
   energy, and carbon cycles, significant efforts and resources have been
   devoted in recent years to advance SM measurement and monitoring
   capabilities from the point to the global scales. This review

Abstract = {Soil moisture sensing plays an important role in agriculture, especially
   in greenhouses or vertical farms. However, existing soil moisture
   sensing systems are either expensive and require batteries or suffer
   from low accuracy, preventing their real-world applications. This paper
   introduces SoilTAG, a battery-free, chipless tag-based high accuracy
   soil moisture sensing system. The key insight is that the tag's
   resonator can convert changes in soil moisture levels into changes in
   the tag's frequency response. However, two challenges need to be
   addressed before applying the system to the real world. First, how to
   design a resonator whose frequency response is sensitive to even small
   moisture changes, which is the basis for high-precision moisture
   sensing. To solve the challenge, we design a special structure (i.e., a
   defected ground structure) as the tag's resonator and optimize its key
   parameters to increase the frequency response sensitivity for different
   soil moisture levels. Second, how to design a robust soil moisture
   feature that is independent of the tag's location changes, since the
   frequency response varies by both the tag location and soil moisture. To
   deal with this challenge, we introduce a relative frequency response
   feature whose amplitude ratio is only related to soil moisture levels
   and independent of the tag location changes. Extensive experiments show
   that SoilTAG achieves 90th percentile moisture sensing error of 2\% ,
   3.64\% , and 8\% when the distance between transmitter and tag is 6 m,
   10 m, and 13.9 m. Compared to current commodity sensors, SoilTAG saves
   the cost per sensor by more than 70\%.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to develop a soil moisture measurement system with a
   monopole antenna sensor, mini-VNA Tiny and a mobile phone respectively.
   The mini-VNA Tiny is a compact vector network analyzer (VNA) with a USB
   connection to a smartphone or a tablet. There are 17 sets of data which
   have been collected from 15 different spots with varying soil moisture
   content. The actual moisture content on site was collected from
   TRIME-PICO 64/32 sensor. Upon collection, it was necessary to calibrate
   the resistance obtained from the mini-VNA between 1 MHz and 3 GHz. The
   data obtained from the study shows that the resonances of the antenna
   resistance shift to the left on the frequency spectrum as moisture
   content increases. A linear model relating the resistance and actual
   moisture content was developed from this study with coefficient of
   determination (R-2) value of 0.723 at 13 MHz. This value is much less
   than the anticipated R-2 = 0.95 for accurate measurement of soil
   moisture with monopole antenna at microwave frequency. This could be due
   to the 0.60 cm thickness of the monopole antenna which may not be suited
   for soil moisture measurement. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the
   potential application of an inexpensive and portable mini-VNA Tiny and
   smartphone system for sensing applications.},

Abstract = {Currently, near-surface soil moisture at a global scale is being
   provided using National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA's)
   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and European Space Agency's (ESA's)
   Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellites, both of which
   utilize L-band (1.4 GHz; 21 cm wavelength ) passive microwave remote
   sensing techniques. However, a fundamental limitation of this technology
   is that the water content can only be measured for approximately the top
   5-cm layer of soil moisture, and only over low-to-moderate vegetation
   covered areas in order to meet the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) target accuracy,
   limiting its applicability. Consequently, a longer wavelength radiometer
   is being explored as a potential solution for measuring soil moisture in
   a deeper surface layer of soil and under denser vegetation. It is
   expected that P-band ( wavelength of 40 cm and frequency of 750 MHz)
   could potentially provide soil moisture information for the top similar
   to 10-cm layer of soil, being one-tenth to one-quarter of the
   wavelength. In addition, P-band is expected to have higher soil moisture
   retrieval accuracy due to its reduced sensitivity to vegetation water
   content and surface roughness. To demonstrate the potential of P-band
   passive microwave soil moisture remote sensing, a short-term airborne
   field experiment was conducted over a center pivot irrigated farm at
   Cressy in Tasmania, Australia, in January 2017. First results showing a
   comparison of airborne P-band brightness temperature observations

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a pivotal hydrological variable that links the
   terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. In this article, a new
   soil moisture (SM) index (SMI), which aims to capture the temporal
   variability of SM, irrespective of cloud cover and solar illumination,
   was developed by using the L-band SM active passive (SMAP) radiometer
   observations. The SMI was proposed on the basis of two key foundations:
   1) vegetation and roughness have similar effects on ``depolarization{''}
   of microwave emission, while SM enhances polarization differences and 2)
   vegetation and roughness generally impose positive effects on surface
   emissivity, while SM and emissivity are negatively correlated. Based on
   the two physical principles, it is possible to decouple the effects of
   SM and those of vegetation and surface roughness in a 2-D space
   independent of vegetation type and roughness condition. The proposed SMI
   was then validated by in situ measurements from five dense SM networks
   covering different vegetation and climatic conditions and also compared
   with SMAP passive and European space agency climate change initiative
   (ESA CCI) SM products at a coarse resolution of 36 km, and SMAP-enhanced
   passive and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) advanced microwave
   scanning radiometer (AMSR2) SM products at a medium resolution of 9 km.
   The results show that the new SMI is able to well reproduce the temporal
   dynamic of SM with a favorable averaged correlation coefficient value of
   0.87 and 0.84 at 36 and 9 km, respectively, higher than that of SMAP
   passive (0.80), SMAP-enhanced passive (0.77), ESA CCI (0.69), and JAXA
   AMSR2 (0.53). After removing the systematic differences between
   satellite and site-specific SM data by using the cumulative distribution
   function (CDF) matching technique, the SMI can achieve an average root
   mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.031 and 0.036 m(3)m(-3) at 36 and 9 km
   during the validation period, respectively, lower than that of the
   satellite SM products. In addition to surface temperature, the SMI does
   not need any further information from other sensors {[}e.g., the optical
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or leaf area index (LAI)
   data] to guarantee an all-weather monitoring. Therefore, it has great
   potential to estimate SM variability on a global scale.},

Abstract = {Accuracy of capacitance moisture sensors is typically deteriorated on
   account of soil bulk electrical conductivity effect. In this work, a
   low-cost capacitance sensor with dual frequency excitation for soil
   water content measurement was proposed. Then, a two-step calibration
   method was presented to reduce soil bulk electrical conductivity effect
   on soil water content. Firstly, the mathematical model of output
   voltages U under dual frequency (f1 and f2) excitation and dielectric
   permittivity Ka was established with several solution samples. Secondly,
   the empirical calibration equation of dielectric permittivity Ka and
   soil volume water content theta was determined with soil samples.
   Finally, the two-step calibration method was evaluated compared with
   empirical equations. Four different soil water content (25\%, 31\%,
   36\%, and 41\%) samples were prepared with electrical conductivities in
   range of 0-1100 mu S/cm. The results showed that the mathematical model
   of theta - Ka has a better linearity which determination coefficient R-2
   was 0.994, the maximum measurement error was 0.012 m(3).m(-3), and the
   maximum electrical conductivity variation was 0.029 when the soil water
   content was 41\%. In a word, the two-step calibration method is
   effective on reducing soil bulk electrical conductivity effect on soil
   water content measurement and improving its accuracy.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) has an important role in the earth's water cycle and
   is a key variable in water resources management. Considering the
   critical state of water resources in the Urmia Lake basin, northwest
   Iran, this study examined the potential for utilizing a variety of
   remote sensing data and products, in conjunction with a promising
   downscaling method, to monitor soil moisture with a reasonable spatial

   km) using the UCLA downscaling method and Temperature, Vegetation,
   Drought Index (TVDI) values obtained from the scattering space method.
   Results showed that the LPRM, ESA-CCI, and GLDAS downscaled images had
   the highest inverse correlation with the TVDI (best results) accordingly
   equal to -0.600, -0.787, and -0.630. Also, based on the evaluation of

   Soil Moisture and Conductivity},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The measurement of soil water content is a very important factor in
   plant cultivation, both from an economic and ecological point of view.
   Proper estimation of moisture content not only allows for proper yields
   but can also contribute to ecologically appropriate use of fresh water,
   of which the world's resources are limited. It is important, for
   example, that the moisture content in the root area of plants is optimal
   for their growth, while over-watering can result in losses in the form
   of water, which seeps below the root layer and is lost. The novel,
   inexpensive electronic meter for measuring soil moisture is presented in
   the article. The meter, based on a capacitive method, uses an
   optimization algorithm to calculate soil electrical permeability and a
   simplified new formula between soil electrical permeability and
   volumetric moisture content. Moreover, by using two high-frequency
   signals for measurements, it is possible not only to estimate moisture
   content but also soil conductivity. Both readings obtained from the
   meter not only allow for rational management of crop optimization for
   economic reasons but are also important for environmental protection. In
   addition, the inexpensive meter, based on the principle of operation
   presented, can be made as an IoT module, which allows for its wide
   application.},

   based on weighted correction of distance measurement},

Abstract = {At present, Wireless Sensor Network technology are widely used in the
   fields of agricultural environment monitoring. Whether we use ground
   network or ground-air coordination, the position coordinates of unknown
   nodes are an important feature of sensor information collection. To
   achieve the goal of a wireless monitoring system for field soil
   irrigation and its node positioning, we proposed an RSSI (Received
   Signal Intensity Indication)-based agricultural environment irrigation
   monitoring system. The algorithm has three stages: RSSI ranging, error
   correction, and localization. In the RSSI ranging phase, we obtain
   inter-node measurement distance by wireless channel modeling. In the
   distance-weighted correction phase, considering the difference between
   the measured distance of the beacon nodes and the actual distance, we
   analyze and select the relative error coefficient for the beacon nodes
   to correct the measured distance between the unknown nodes and the
   beacon nodes within their communication range. In the positioning stage
   for the nodes to be located, we estimated the required node coordinates
   using a weighted centroid localization method. In addition, by analyzing
   the monitoring data, we know the changes in soil moisture in real-time,
   which provides new ideas for irrigation automation and the efficient
   utilization of water resources. When designing the algorithm, we
   thoroughly considered the influence of RSSI ranging inaccuracy and the
   quantity of beacon nodes on the localization precision. The test
   demonstrated that the method presented in this paper has higher
   localization precision and lower computation cost.
   In the application of the irrigation monitoring system in the
   agricultural environment, an RSSI-based ranging method is proposed for
   node localization.In the RSSI distance weighting correction stage, the
   difference between the measured distance of the beacon node and the
   actual distance is fully considered, and the relative error coefficient
   of the beacon node is analyzed and selected to obtain the accurate
   measurement distance.Under the case of harsh network environment and
   limited positioning cost, the system achieves better positioning effect.
   Compared with the least squares method, the method has high positioning
   accuracy and small computational amount.},

Journal = {ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {42},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Soil penetration resistance (PR) assessment is a physical assessment of
   soil to identify compacted soil layers. Its results are influenced by
   soil moisture. In this study, a method for correcting PR as a function
   of soil water content is proposed. The proposed method employs the same
   function that represents the relationship between PR and soil moisture
   to calculate the correction that should be applied to the data. The
   method was evaluated in a Quartzipmment and an Oxisol, at reference
   moistures of 0.05 to 0.25 kg kg(-1) and 0.10 to 0.30 kg kg(-1),
   respectively. In addition, the efficiency was evaluated based on mean
   absolute error (MAE), bias, and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE).
   Following correction, the PR data of both soil classes followed the
   reference PR values (calculated for reference moisture). The largest
   errors were -0.474 (bias), 0.360 (MAPE), and 0.505 (MAE) for the Oxisol,
   and 0.112 (bias), 0.616 (MAPE), and 0.286 (MAE) for the Quartzipmment.
   Furthermore, the best performance occurred at a reference moisture of
   0.25 and 0.10 kg kg(-1) for Oxisol and Quartzipmment, respectively.
   Moreover, these moistures were close to the suction pressure of 10 kPa
   for both soils.},

   using variable weight stacking automatic encoder combined with support

Abstract = {An appropriate proportion of water content in the soil is critical for

   the very property of soil that the dielectric value of soil varies with

Abstract = {Ground level enhancements (GLEs) are space weather events that pose a
   potential hazard to the aviation environment through single event
   effects in avionics and increased dose to passengers and crew. The
   existing ground level neutron monitoring network provides continuous and
   well-characterized measurements of the radiation environment. However,
   there are only a few dozen active stations worldwide, and there has not
   been a UK-based station for several decades. Much smaller neutron
   detectors are increasingly deployed throughout the world with the
   purpose of using secondary neutrons from cosmic rays to monitor local
   soil moisture conditions (COSMOS). Space weather signals from GLEs and
   Forbush decreases have been identified in COSMOS data. Monte Carlo
   simulations of atmospheric radiation propagation show that a single
   COSMOS detector is sufficient to detect the signal of a medium-strength
   (10\%-100\% increase above background) GLE at high statistical
   significance, including at fine temporal resolution. Use of fine
   temporal resolution would also provide a capability to detect
   Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes (via secondary neutrons) which are
   produced by certain lightning discharges and which can provide a hazard
   to aircraft, particularly in tropical regions. We also show how the
   COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System-UK detector network could be
   used to provide warnings at the International Civil Aviation
   Organization ``Moderate{''} and ``Severe{''} dose rate thresholds at
   aviation altitudes, and how multiple-detector hubs situated at strategic
   UK locations could detect a small GLE at high statistical significance
   and infer crucial information on the nature of the primary spectrum.},

Abstract = {The U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) has been engaged in
   ground-based soil water and soil temperature observations since 2009. As
   a nationwide climate network, the network stations are distributed
   across vast complex terrains. Due to the expansive distribution of the
   network and the related variability in soil properties, obtaining
   site-specific calibrations for sensors is a significant and costly
   endeavor. Presented here are three commercial-grade electromagnetic
   sensors, with built-in thermistors to measure both soil water and soil
   temperature, including the SoilVUE10 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR)
   probe (hereafter called SP) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.), 50 MHz coaxial
   impedance dielectric sensor (model HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring
   Systems, Inc.) (hereafter called HP), and the TDR-315L Probe (model
   TDR-315L, Acclima, Inc.) (hereafter called AP), which were evaluated in
   a relatively nonconductive loam soil in Oak Ridge, TN, from 2021 to
   2022. The HP manufacturer-supplied calibration equation for loam soils
   was used in this study. While volumetric water content data from HP and
   AP were 82-99\% of respective gravimetric observations at 10 cm, data
   from SP were only 65-81\% of respective gravimetric observations in the
   top 20-cm soil horizon, where soil water showed relatively large spatial
   variability. The poor performance of the SP is likely due to poor
   contact between SP sensor electrodes and soil and the presence of soil
   voids caused by the installation method used, which itself may have
   caused soil disturbance.},

Abstract = {The multilayer soil moisture Internet of things sensor is designed to
   monitor the moisture of multiple soil profiles in real time. Its
   sensitivity and accuracy are of great concern to improve the performance

   and the deredundancy circuit in the analog-digital integrated design.
   The performance of the soil moisture detection circuit is directly
   related to the measurement accuracy of the sensor. A detection method is
   proposed using a high-frequency double-resonance circuit, which can
   detect small changes in moisture by changing the circuit detuning
   voltage. The maximum root mean square error of the calibration is less
   than 1.35\% for five typical soils from different places. Compared with
   that of an independent detection method, the output consistency of the
   time division multiplexing detection is significantly improved by using
   the time division multiplexing detection method, which has a root mean
   square error of only 0.12\%. In order to reduce errors caused by
   inconsistency in each burial, the gravimetric analysis is used in the
   sensitivity monitoring test, which shows that small changes in soil

   information, and then extract the crop canopy temperature. Specifically,
   the soil moisture prediction model based on Radial Basis Function Neural
   Network (RBFNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are established
   to achieve accurate prediction of farmland moisture. Experimental
   results show that (1) the proposed adaptive method is capable of
   improving the detection accuracy of the target canopy boundary and soil
   background; (2) by establishing the linear regression model between the
   real ground temperature and the UAV data, it is shown that the Canny
   algorithm can improve the extraction accuracy of the canopy temperature
   data from R<\^{}>2 = 0.7673 to R<\^{}>2 = 0.9355; (3) compared with the
   PCA method can greatly reduce the dimension of sample data, while the
   accuracy of the soil moisture content is almost unchanged. This article
   establishes a set of intelligent prediction methods for soil moisture
   content, which greatly improves the level of agricultural intelligence.},

Title = {Improving Soil Water Content and Surface Flux Estimation Based on Data
   Assimilation Technique},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Land surface model is a powerful tool for estimating continuous soil
   water content (SWC) and surface fluxes. However, simulation error tends
   to accumulate in the process of model simulation due to the inevitable
   uncertainties of forcing data and the intrinsic model errors. Data
   assimilation techniques consider the uncertainty of the model, update
   model states during the simulation period, and therefore improve the
   accuracy of SWC and surface fluxes estimation. In this study, an
   Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) technique was coupled to a Hydrologically
   Enhanced Land Process (HELP) model to update model states, including SWC
   and surface temperature (Ts). The remotely sensed latent heat flux (LE)
   estimated by Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) was used as the
   observation value in the data assimilation system to update the model
   states such as SWC and Ts, etc. The model was validated by the
   observation data in 2006 at the Weishan flux station, where the
   open-loop estimation without state updating was treated as the benchmark
   run. Results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) of SWC was
   reduced by 30\%similar to 50\% compared to the benchmark run. Meanwhile,
   the surface fluxes also had significant improvement to different
   extents, among which the RMSE of LE estimation from the wheat season and
   maize season reduced by 33\% and 44\%, respectively. The application of
   the data assimilation technique can substantially improve the estimation
   of surface fluxes and SWC states. It is suggested that the data
   assimilation system has great potential to be used in the application of
   land surface models in agriculture and water management.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing technology provides a viable way for large-scale soil
   water content (SWC) estimation. The perpendicular drought index (PDI)
   and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) are two drought indices
   that can reflect SWC based on remote sensing data. These two indices
   have their own set of pros and cons when used independently for SWC
   estimation: PDI is primarily suitable for low vegetation coverage,
   whereas TVDI is more suitable for dense vegetation coverage. Thus, it
   might be inappropriate to employ a single model for the entire growth
   cycle. In this study, the relationship between PDI/TVDI and SWC at soil
   depths of 0-20 cm, 0-30 cm and 0-40 cm was analysed. We found that the
   estimation accuracy of the PDI/TVDI model was markedly affected by soil
   depth and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Two
   combination approaches (joint and combined models) based on PDI and TVDI
   indices were established. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the
   joint/combined models were 1.49\%/1.48\% at 0-20 cm, 1.46\%/1.48\% at
   0-30 cm and 1.86\%/1.90\% at 0-40 cm. Our results show that both
   combination models are suitable for regional SWC estimation.},

Title = {Soil water content and actual evapotranspiration predictions using

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {241},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The application of technology and the development of data analysis, such
   as remote sensing and regression algorithms, are an easy and inexpensive
   way to estimate parameters related to water management, such as actual
   evapotranspiration (ETa) and soil water content (SWC). Therefore, the
   objective of this study was to predict the water management parameters
   with vegetation indices (VIs) and regression algorithms to enable
   irrigation management in a totally remote manner. The study was carried
   out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western
   part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The MOD09GQ product was used to
   generate input data for the training models and to understand the
   phenology variations in the crops. The prediction of the dependent
   variables was tested using six regression algorithms, and the best
   algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics. Among the
   regression models tested, the three that best fit the ETa and SWC data
   were RF (random forest), cubist (cubist regression), and GBM (gradient
   boosting machine), with slight superiority of cubist for the ETa and RF
   for the SWC. The fitted models for ETa and SWC showed the potential of
   VIs in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing
   the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the SWC and ETa
   variables. The findings make it possible to monitor irrigation
   efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths, a fact that
   is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical
   and scientific communities.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable for drought monitoring, but soil
   moisture measurements networks are very scarce. Land-surface models can
   provide a valuable alternative for simulating soil moisture dynamics,
   but only a few countries have such modelling schemes implemented for
   monitoring soil moisture at high spatial resolution. In this study, a
   soil moisture accounting model (SMA) was regionalized over the Iberian
   Peninsula, taking as a reference the soil moisture simulated by a
   high-resolution land-surface model. To estimate the soil water holding
   capacity, the sole parameter required to run the SMA model, two
   approaches were compared: the direct estimation from European soil maps
   using pedotransfer functions or an indirect estimation by a machine
   learning approach, random forests, using as predictors altitude,
   temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and land use.
   Results showed that the random forest model estimates are more robust,
   especially for estimating low soil moisture levels. Consequently, the
   proposed approach can provide an efficient way to simulate daily soil
   moisture and therefore monitor soil moisture droughts, in contexts where
   high-resolution soil maps are not available, as it relies on a set of
   covariates that can be reliably estimated from global databases.},

Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {2833-2844},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key parameter of the hydrological process, which
   affects exchanges of water and heat at the land/atmosphere interface.
   The ``trapezoid{''} (or ``triangle{''}) method has been widely applied
   to SM monitoring based on the pixel distribution within the thermal and
   optical remote sensing observations. However, the trapezoid method is a
   linear empirical model highly related to the retrieval accuracy of the
   surface temperature. In the article, the moderate-resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were applied to retrieve SM through an
   improved method over the Tibetan Plateau. The improved method is
   integrated with the ``trapezoid{''} model and multiple learning
   techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost).
   Meanwhile, RF and XGBoost were both trained with SM target data (the
   scale of SM and soil temperature) derived from the Tibetan Plateau
   observations, and the input variables were derived from MODIS
   observations. Compared with the SM measured, the results showed the root
   mean square error, the mean absolute error, and the correlation
   coefficient of the ensemble retrievals were 0.046-0.081 m(3)m(-3),
   0.030-0.065 m(3)m(-3), and 0.60-0.87, respectively, which is better than
   that of the separate model. The ideas to implement the combination of
   traditional inversion algorithms and machine learning methods are
   helpful for researches in remote sensing fields.},

Abstract = {This article presents a time domain transmissometry soil moisture sensor
   (TDT-SMS) using a dispersive phase shifter (DPS), consisting of an
   interdigital capacitor that is loaded with a stacked four-turn
   complementary spiral resonator (S4-CSR). Soil moisture measurement
   technique of the proposed sensor is based on the complex permittivity
   sensing property of a DPS in time domain. Soil relative permittivity
   which varies with its moisture content is measured by burying the DPS
   under a soil mass and changing its phase difference while excited with a
   114-MHz sine wave (single tone). DPS output phase and magnitude are
   compared with the reference signal and measured with a phase/loss
   detector. The proposed sensor exhibits accuracy better than +/- 1.2\% at
   the highest volumetric water content (VWC = 30\%) for sandy-type soil.
   Precise design guide is developed and simulations are performed to
   achieve a highly sensitive sensor. The measurement results validate the
   accuracy of theoretical analysis and design procedure. Owning the
   advantages of low profile, low power consumption, and high sensitivity
   makes the proposed TDT-SMS a good candidate for precision farming and

Abstract = {The agriculture sector accounts for 80\% of the total freshwater

   Statistical analysis shows that the low-cost WAISS soil moisture sensors
   are comparable with the commercially developed sensors with a Percent

   under Laboratory and Field Conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {APR 23},
Abstract = {Soil water content (SWC, \% vol) is a key factor affecting plant growth
   and development. SWC measurement is vital to rational use of water
   resources for irrigation, and the accuracy of sensors in SWC measurement
   is of significant importance to smart data-driven irrigation. Here, a
   laboratory experiment and a field lysimetric experiment were conducted
   to evaluate the accuracy of Insentek sensors under various soil
   conditions (1.1 to 1.5 bulk densities and sand to clay soil textures)
   and irrigation levels (30, 45, and 60 mm), in 2018 and 2019. A
   microweighing lysimeter and oven-drying method were used as standard
   methods to compare the Insentek method. The root mean square error
   (RMSE, \% vol) and relative prediction deviation (RPD) between the
   Insentek and microlysimetric SWC values were 0.89-1.04\% vol and
   5.6-6.8, respectively, under laboratory condition. The RPD value is
   larger than the threshold value of 4.0, indicating the accuracy of the
   Insentek sensors is reliable under laboratory condition. Except for 60
   mm irrigation treatment, the RMSE between Insentek and the oven-drying
   method under field condition was 1.44-1.93\% vol, and the RPD value was
   1.56-1.93, lower than the threshold value of 4.0. The tiny gap between
   the Insentek sensor and soil may accelerate water infiltration along the
   probe 0-3 d after irrigation while increase air filling 5-7 d after
   irrigation, causing greater RMSE and lower RPD values. The dissatisfied
   performance in field condition may also be associated with the obvious
   drawbacks of oven-drying method, such as disturbance in soil sampling.
   When using oven-drying method to analyze the accuracy of the Insentek
   sensors in field condition, the concerns should be well addressed.},

Title = {A spatial downscaling method for SMAP soil moisture through visible and
   shortwave-infrared remote sensing data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {590},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays an indispensable role in many practical
   applications, such as drought monitoring, hydrologic applications and
   agricultural management. Passive microwave remote sensing has proven
   capable of capturing changes in SM. However, the coarse spatial
   resolution (approximately 25-40 km) may greatly limit many regional
   hydrological and agricultural applications. In this study, we present a
   SM downscaling method based on the visible and shortwave-infrared (SWIR)
   remote sensing data toward improved spatial resolution of Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) SM. In the proposed method, the Land Surface
   Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   horizontally polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh), vertically
   polarized Brightness Temperature (TBv) and SWIR reflectance collected in
   Inner Mongolia from April to September 2018 and April to September 2019
   are used as input data and combined with topographic information to
   downscale the SMAP SM L3 product from the original 36 km to 1 km. Random
   forest (RF) was used to link the input data and SMAP SM. Finally, 30 in
   situ station SM measurements distributed in Inner Mongolia and
   precipitation data were used to verify the downscaled SM. The results
   show that the correlation range of the downscaled SM and the in situ SM
   is 0.246 to 0.739, with an average of 0.535. The root mean square error
   (RMSE) range is 0.02 to 0.152 m(3)/m(3), and the mean RMSE is 0.059
   m(3)/m(3). The ubRMSE has a range of 0.02 to 0.06 m(3)/m(3), and the
   mean performance is 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The bias ranges from - 0.145 to
   0.087 m(3)/m(3), and the mean bias is 0.008 m(3)/m(3). The downscaled
   SMAP SM can capture the spatial heterogeneity of the SMAP SM and the
   dynamic changes in measured soil moisture. The downscaled SMAP SM also
   has a high spatial correspondence with the original SMAP SM, providing
   more detailed soil water information than the original 36 km resolution.},

Title = {Quantifying Uncertainties in Passive Microwave Remote Sensing of Soil
   Moisture via a Bayesian Probabilistic Inversion Method},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Improving the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) is a
   challenging and popular topic. Quantifying the uncertainty in the SM
   inversion process and enhancing the confidence of SM retrieval are
   promising ways to address this challenge but have received little
   attention. We present a Bayesian probabilistic inversion algorithm that
   can simultaneously retrieve SM, surface roughness, and vegetation
   optical depth and quantify the uncertainty in the inversion. The
   proposed algorithm is evaluated using airborne polarimetric L-band
   multibeam radiometer (PLMR) observations. We use three combinations,
   3-angular observations at V-polarization (3CV), 3-angular observations
   at H-polarization (3CH), and 6-channel observations (6CA), to identify
   the optimal configuration for SM retrieval by taking advantage of PLMR's
   dual-polarization and multiple angles. Uncertainties are quantified by
   introducing multiple uncertainty quantification metrics into Bayesian
   posterior distributions of SM retrievals. The estimates are validated
   against multiscale ground-based measurements, including manual
   measurements and wireless sensor network (WSN) measurements, and the
   spatial representativeness of the ground-based reference regarding the
   validation of pixel-scale SM retrievals is discussed. The 6CA attempt
   yields the best SM estimates (correlation coefficient (R) >= 0.864 ,
   root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.04 m(3)/m(3), and unbiased RMSE
   (ubRMSE) <= 0.035 m(3)/m(3)), while the 3CH attempt yields the lowest
   uncertainty. In addition, dense manual measurements are more
   representative than sparsely distributed WSN measurements. Overall,
   combining dual-polarized observations yields the best SM estimates but
   introduces additional uncertainty. This study highlights uncertainties
   quantification in SM inversion and thus provides confidence in SM
   inversion, facilitating improved SM retrieval algorithms.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture content (MC) and density of pavement materials exert a
   great influence on pavement performance. Cyclic traffic loading with
   increasing MC in materials can accelerate changes in density
   significantly. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a non-destructive
   method for measuring MC and density of soil. In this study, TDR
   measurements were taken in the laboratory for a typical road material at
   two different conditions; at constant MC with different density and at
   constant dry density with different MC. Based on TDR measurements, a
   theoretical formulation between voltage drop occurring for the passage
   of an electromagnetic wave through the soil and the electrical
   conductivity (EC) is developed. This relationship is further correlated
   to develop density function providing the opportunity to obtain MC
   information. For the validation of the calibration functions, sensors
   are installed in roads to obtain field data. Laboratory results point
   out that the calibration models are independent of moisture and density,
   and the field instrumentation shows the satisfactory accuracy of the
   method. The newly established calibration models allow for observing the
   routine performance providing a better understanding of the material
   behaviour for example rutting of roads.},

Abstract = {: The sequence of drought events in the Northeast of Brazil in recent
   decades raises attention to the importance of studying this phenomenon.
   The objective of this study was to evaluate the duration and severity of
   drought events from 1988 to 2018 in hydrographic basins of the state of
   Pernambuco, Brazil, using two drought indexes: Standardized Soil
   Moisture Index and Soil Moisture Condition Index, calculated based on
   data of the Soil Moisture Project of the European Space Agency's Climate
   Change Initiative. The duration of the droughts was determined
   considering the months between their beginning and end, and their
   severity was based on the area formed in the graph between the curve of
   the index and the x-axis. The soil moisture database showed to be a
   promising tool for the analysis and monitoring of drought events in the
   Northeast region of Brazil, mainly for analysis and monitoring of
   drought events. The indexes allowed the evaluation of the drought
   phenomenon over the 30-year period, showing increases from 2012, which
   were more pronounced in the Semiarid region. The hydrographic basins
   responded differently to a same event, depending on the climate
   characteristics of the region in which they are located. Consecutive
   years with rainfall below the historical mean increased the magnitude of
   the droughts, as found for the 2012-2017 period, in which the indexes
   presented delays to return to more favorable values, showing the effect
   that one drought year has on the following year.},

Title = {Review of GNSS-R Technology for Soil Moisture Inversion},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter in water cycle research.
   Rapid and accurate monitoring of SM is critical for hydrological and
   agricultural applications, such as flood detection and drought
   characterization. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) uses
   L-band microwave signals as carriers, which are particularly sensitive
   to SM and suitable for monitoring it. In recent years, with the
   development of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R)
   technology and data analysis methods, many studies have been conducted
   on GNSS-R SM monitoring, which has further enriched the research
   content. However, current GNSS-R SM inversion methods mainly rely on
   auxiliary data to reduce the impact of non-target parameters on the
   accuracy of inversion results, which limits the practical application
   and widespread promotion of GNSS-R SM monitoring. In order to promote
   further development in GNSS-R SM inversion research, this paper aims to
   comprehensively review the current status and principles of GNSS-R SM
   inversion methods. It also aims to identify the problems and future
   research directions of existing research, providing a reference for
   researchers. Firstly, it introduces the characteristics, usage
   scenarios, and research status of different GNSS-R SM observation
   platforms. Then, it explains the mechanisms and modeling methods of
   various GNSS-R SM inversion research methods. Finally, it highlights the
   shortcomings of existing research and proposes future research
   directions, including the introduction of transfer learning (TL),
   construction of small models based on spatiotemporal analysis and
   spatial feature fusion, and further promoting downscaling research.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a significant role in the global hydrological cycle,
   which is an important component of soil parameterization. Remote sensing
   is one of the most important methods used to estimate soil moisture. In
   this study, we developed a new nonlinear Erf-BP neural network method to
   establish a soil-moisture-content-estimation model with integrated
   multiple-resource remote-sensing data from high-resolution,
   hyperspectral and microwave sensors. Next, we compared the result with
   the single-resource remote-sensing data for SMC (soil-moisture content)
   estimation models by using the linear-fitting method. The results showed
   that the soil-moisture estimation model offers better accuracy by using
   multiple-resource remote-sensing data. Furthermore, the SMC predicted
   the results by using the new Erf-BP neural network with
   multiple-resource remote-sensing data and a good overall correlation
   coefficient of 0.6838. Compared with the linear model's estimation
   results, the accuracy of the SMC estimation using the Erf-BP method was
   increased, and the RMSE decreased from 0.017 g/g to 0.0146 g/g, a
   decrease of 16.44\%. These results also indicate that the improved
   algorithm of the Erf-BP artificial neural network has better fitting
   results and precision. This research provides a reference for
   multiple-resource remote-sensing data for soil-moisture estimation.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is one of the least monitored of all the hydrologic
   variables. It is greatly influenced by unpredictable and intermittent
   precipitation, varying evapotranspiration rates, heterogeneous soils,
   land cover, topography, and is extremely changeable in both space and
   time. The aim of this study is to retrieve surface and rootzone soil
   moisture in fallow land at a field scale using Sentinel-1A SAR data. The
   study explores the potential of obtaining surface soil moisture over
   fallow land at two different soil types from C-band SAR data. The study
   area consists of two plots having different soil types. The study area
   was divided into 80 grids, each measuring 10 x 10 m, to collect soil
   samples which are synchronized with Sentinel-1A passes. The soil
   moisture which are retrieved from plot 1 were used to develop the model.
   The developed model was validated in plot 2. In order to study the
   impact of soil moisture and dielectric constant on backscattering
   coefficients, a multiple regression analysis was used to create a
   semi-empirical model. Rootzone soil moisture retrieval model was
   developed by considering the backscattered coefficient, volumetric
   surface soil moisture as an independent variable and volumetric rootzone
   soil moisture as dependent variable. The predicted surface soil moisture
   using the regression model were identical to in-situ observed surface
   soil moisture, with R2 of 0.77, RMSE of 1.31 m3/m3, and NSE of 0.75. The
   estimated rootzone soil moisture matches the in-situ observed rootzone
   soil moisture identically with R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.23 m3/m3, NSE = 0.73.

   Applied to Soil Water Content Determination},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {A new and compact sensor based on the complementary split-ring resonator
   (CSRR) structure is proposed to characterize the relative permittivity
   of various dielectric materials, enabling the determination of soil
   water content (SWC). The proposed sensor consists of a circular
   microstrip patch antenna supporting a 3D-printed small cylindrical
   container made out of Acrylonitrile-Butadiene-Styrene (ABS) filament.
   The principle of operation is based on the shifting of two of the
   antenna resonant frequencies caused by changing the relative
   permittivity of the material under test (MUT). Simulations are performed
   enabling the development of an empirical model of analysis. The
   sensitivity of the sensor is investigated and its effectiveness is
   analyzed by characterizing typical dielectric materials. The proposed
   sensor, which can be applied to characterize different types of
   dielectric materials, is used to determine the percentage of water
   contained in different soil types. Prototypes are fabricated and
   measured and the obtained results are compared with results from other
   research works, to validate the proposed sensor effectiveness. Moreover,
   the sensor was used to determine the percentage of water concentration

Title = {Fiber-optic seismic sensing of vadose zone soil moisture dynamics},
Journal = {NATURE COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 5},
Abstract = {Vadose zone soil moisture is often considered a pivotal intermediary
   water reservoir between surface and groundwater in semi-arid regions.
   Understanding its dynamics in response to changes in meteorologic
   forcing patterns is essential to enhance the climate resiliency of our
   ecological and agricultural system. However, the inability to observe
   high-resolution vadose zone soil moisture dynamics over large
   spatiotemporal scales hinders quantitative characterization. Here,
   utilizing pre-existing fiber-optic cables as seismic sensors, we
   demonstrate a fiber-optic seismic sensing principle to robustly capture
   vadose zone soil moisture dynamics. Our observations in Ridgecrest,
   California reveal sub-seasonal precipitation replenishments and a
   prolonged drought in the vadose zone, consistent with a zero-dimensional
   hydrological model. Our results suggest a significant water loss of 0.25
   m/year through evapotranspiration at our field side, validated by nearby
   eddy-covariance based measurements. Yet, detailed discrepancies between
   our observations and modeling highlight the necessity for complementary
   in-situ validations. Given the escalated regional drought risk under
   climate change, our findings underscore the promise of fiber-optic
   seismic sensing to facilitate water resource management in semi-arid
   regions.
   A fiber-optic seismic sensing principle provides a spatiotemporal view
   of vadose zone soil moisture dynamics, offering a scalable solution for
   enhanced long-term, large-scale water resource management in face of

Journal = {MEASUREMENT},

Abstract = {Accurately moisture content measurement is crucial in addressing
   engineering problems of expansive soil with cracks. In this study, the
   actively heated fiber Bragg grating (AH-FBG) sensing technology was used
   to measure in-situ moisture contents of expansive soil. The impact of
   soil cracks on the measurements was investigated through a series of
   numerical simulations, and a modified function was proposed to eliminate
   measurement errors. The results show that the Cai model can accurately
   describe the relationship between the thermal conductivity and moisture
   content, and is thus utilized as the calibration model. Under the
   heating strategy, the influence range of the sensor is roughly 4 cm in
   the radial direction. Cracks within that range hinder heat transmission,
   leading to underestimation of moisture contents. The RMSE of the
   measurements after modification is reduced to 0.030 m(3).m(-3), which
   verifies that AH-FBG sensing technology can be extended to the reliable
   measurement of expansive soil moisture.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {263},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This work was initiated in 2019 within the FAO WEPS project framework
   (2018-2022), aiming to determine the Water Productivity (WP) of the
   Tunisian olive orchards combining two scales of measurements for soil
   moisture determination: one for the global analysis (remote sensing) and
   the other for the field scale application. The experiment was made in
   2019 and 2020 in the Centre of Tunisia (Kairouan city, locality of
   Elhouereb), which is one of the largest irrigation area of Tunisia. WP
   was computed regarding the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) which
   was determined following the water balance method as: ETa=R+I-Delta S,
   where Delta S is the amount of water stored in the soil (0-60 cm) and
   (R) and (I) are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation
   volume, respectively. The annual ETa reached 293 mm for the rainfed
   orchard, 823 mm for the semi-intensive irrigated plantation and 819 mm
   for the intensive fertigated orchard. The WP defined as being the ratio
   of Yield (kg olives/tree)/ETa ranged between 0.29 kg/m(3) (rainfed) and
   0.77 kg/m(3) (fertigated) depending on the cultivation system. Soil
   moisture was found to be correlated to the average backscatter
   coefficient (r =-0.34 for the rainfed and 0.91 for the irrigated
   orchards) which was determined from the radar images which were treated
   by using different applications (SNAP, ODK, QGIS.), This result shows
   the performance of the remote sensing tools for such application. To
   conclude: WP is at least two times higher in the irrigated orchards than
   in the rainfed grove; this indicates a great potential of WP improvement
   if the horticultural practices are well applied in the orchad (pruning,
   irrigation); so that, the WP can be used as a decision-making-tool for
   farmers and makers in the future.},

Title = {A field-portable acoustic sensing device to measure soil moisture},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {174},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {For the last couple of decades, the idea of soil water measurement has
   gained widespread importance due to the spiraling crisis of global water
   resources. While several methods are being commonly used for soil water
   measurement, most of them do not satisfy all the essential requirements
   for water monitoring under field conditions including rapid on-site
   measurement and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to evaluate
   the efficacy of a novel field-portable acoustic sensing device on soil
   moisture measurements. The conventional Brutsaert's model was followed
   involving the continuous wave zero-crossing method to measure the
   acoustic velocity and considering the phase shift due to the amplifier
   and ambient temperature. The gravimetric moisture content (GMC) was
   calibrated using the acoustic velocity for 70 samples representing seven
   textural classes and variable soil organic carbon (OC). Results
   indicated the monotonous reduction of the acoustic velocities of p-wave
   with increasing GMC. In general, soils with higher clay content
   reflected higher acoustic velocities. However, sandy soils with high OC
   content were less prone to compaction and produced comparatively higher
   acoustic velocities than soils with higher clay content. A linear mixed
   effect (LME) model indicated that one unit increase in the acoustic
   velocity resulted in a 0.086\% decrease in GMC. Moreover, LME
   parameters-based K-means clustering further highlighted the influence of
   soil texture for controlling the acoustic velocity. The use of LME
   justified the use of GMC as the target instead of the degree of
   saturation. Linear and quadratic models fitted for individual LME-based
   clusters produced R-2 values ranging from 0.80 to 0.88 and 0.82-0.88,
   respectively. Moreover, combined linear (R-2 = 0.61; RMSE = 52.12 m/s)
   and quadratic (R-2 = 0.64; RMSE = 50.48 m/s) models incorporating all 70
   samples via bootstrapping produced comparable accuracies for GMC
   prediction, but yielded inferior results than the individual
   cluster-based models. In conclusion, the acoustic sensing device showed
   its potential for soil water content monitoring, leading to efficient
   irrigation planning. More research is warranted for texture-wise
   calibration development incorporating a wide assortment of soil types
   and on-site evaluation.},

Abstract = {The basic need common to all living beings is water. Less than 1\% of
   the water on earth is fresh water and water use is increasing daily.
   Agricultural practices alone require huge amounts of water. The drip
   technique improved the efficiency of water use in irrigation and
   initiated the introduction and development of fertigation, the
   integrated distribution of water and fertilizer. The past few decades
   have seen extensive research being carried out in the area of
   development and evaluation of different technologies available to
   estimate/measure soil moisture to aid in various applications and to
   facilitate the use of drip irrigation for users and farmers. In this
   technology, plant moisture and temperature are accurately monitored and
   controlled in real time over roots in the form of droplets, by
   developing smart monitoring system to save water and avoid water waste
   using drip irrigation technology. Water is delivered to the roots drop
   by drop, which saves water as well as prevents plants from being flooded
   and decaying due to excess water released by irrigation methods such as
   flood irrigation, border irrigation, furrow irrigation, and control
   basin irrigation. Drip irrigation with an embedded intelligent
   monitoring system is one of the most valuable techniques used to save
   water and farmers' time and energy. In this paper, we design an embedded
   monitoring system based in the integrated 65 nm CMOS technology in
   agricultural practices which would facilitate agriculture and enable
   farmers to monitor crops. Hence, to demonstrate the feasibility, a
   prototype was constructed and simulated with modelsim and validated with
   nclaunch the both tools from Cadence, as well as implementation on the

Title = {Comparison of soil moisture at different depths for drought monitoring

Abstract = {To better understand the characteristics and mechanisms of droughts at
   different drought stages, this study selected the Xiangjiang River Basin
   in China as the study area, and evaluated soil moisture (SM) at
   different depths for drought monitoring, through SM data simulated with
   the variable infiltration capacity (VIC) model. To solve the problem of
   unreasonable drought/wetness classifications based on the soil moisture
   anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), an improved soil moisture anomaly
   percentage index (ISMAPI) was developed by introducing the Box-Cox
   transformation. The drought/wetness frequency generated by ISMAPI
   demonstrated preferable spatial comparability in comparison with those
   from SMAPI. The lag time of ISMAPI relative to the standardized
   precipitation evapotranspiration index was closely related to soil
   depth, and was characterized by a fast response in shallow soil layers
   and a relatively slow response in deep soil layers. SM in shallow soil
   layers provided a measure for monitoring short-term droughts, whereas SM
   in deep soil layers provided a better measure for long-term persistent
   drought events. Furthermore, the occurrence and mitigation time of
   drought events identified by SM in deep soil layers usually lagged
   behind that identified by SM in shallow soil layers. Compared with deep
   SM, SM in shallow soil layers responded faster to meteorological
   anomalies, thereby resulting in shorter periods of SM persistence in
   shallow soil layers than in deep soil layers. This can explain the
   differences of SM at different depths in drought monitoring. (c) 2021

Abstract = {Principal component analysis (PCA) has been applied in many aspects. To
   address the problem of measuring water content in soil, this paper
   proposes a method to measure soil water content based on the PCA. We
   used PCA to reduce the dimension of the data and processed the soil
   amplitude ratio frequency response spectra. First, we designed the
   measuring device and measured the soil amplitude ratio frequency
   response data of different water content, then we used the PCA to
   extract features from the frequency response spectra of different water
   contents, established a relationship model of soil water content, and
   finally, we solved the model, the maximum error between the calculation
   results and the actual water content was no more than 0.85\%.
   Subsequently, we carried out experimental verification, and we measured
   six kinds of soil with known water content by this method. The
   experimental results showed that the maximum error did not exceed
   1.16\%, and the average error was 0.71\%. Thus, the proposed method can
   provide a useful way of measuring soil water content.},

Abstract = {In the present investigation, we report a voltammetric sensor based on
   Nafion modified screen printed carbon ink functionalized with
   4-aminobenzo-18-crown-6 ether for the detection of soil potassium. The
   potassium is one of the major nutrient elements required by the plants
   and is critical for the crop productivity. The selective and sensitive
   assay is based on recording change in current signal of a positively
   charged redox probe, hexammineruthenium(III)chloride in the absence and
   presence of K+ ion in solution. The sensing interface is highly stable
   and reproducible for detection of K+ ion a under a wide range of
   concentration 1 to 500 ppm. The detection sensitivity over a wide
   concentration range was achieved by altering the concentration of redox
   species. Mechanistically, the recognition properties of
   4-aminobenzo-18-Crown-6 covalently bound to the Nafion on carbon surface
   was found to be selective for potassium ion over sodium, ammonium and
   calcium ion. Potassium recognition through host-guest binding of crown
   ether derivative and proposed simplicity of fabrication protocol makes
   the systems highly promising for real-time applications in soil

Abstract = {This paper presents examples of the application of the TDR (Time-Domain
   Reflectometry) sensor in terramechanical research. Examples include the
   determination of soil moisture content during off-road vehicle mobility
   tests, the determination of snow density before and after the wheeling
   of a snow grooming machine and an airplane, as well as the monitoring of
   turf moisture on a grassy airfield for the analysis and prediction of
   safe and efficient flight operations (takeoff and landing). A handheld
   TDR meter was used in these experiments. Soil moisture data were
   correlated with the vehicle mobility index and a simple model for this
   correlation was derived. Using grassy airfield research, soil moisture
   data were related to meteorological impacts (precipitation, sunlight,
   etc.). Generally, it was concluded that the TDR meter, in its handheld
   version, was a useful tool in the performed research, but a field sensor
   that operates autonomically would be an optimal solution for the subject
   applications.},

Abstract = {Successful precision agriculture decision making requires characterizing
   soil heterogeneity at high spatiotemporal resolution in real-time in
   order to optimize input (such as water and nutrient) amounts and
   location. In order to achieve this goal, a printed soil moisture sensor
   fabricated from biodegradable materials is demonstrated. These devices
   are intended to function during the growing season and then harmlessly
   degrade afterward, enabling high-density deployment, eliminating the
   need for sensor retrieval, and enabling the use of simple device
   structures and low-cost materials and fabrication techniques. A
   capacitive structure is used with a water-soluble zinc electrode printed
   onto a biodegradable substrate. Rapidly degrading substrate and
   electrode are encapsulated in a slowly degrading wax blend that protects
   the device, reduces drift, and controls degradation time. A linear
   capacitance response is observed for soil samples with a volumetric
   water content from 0 to 72\%. Accelerated degradation testing
   demonstrates that the sensor responds predictably and stably until the
   encapsulation is breached, at which point the sensor fails rapidly,
   providing a clear distinction between the functional and nonfunctional
   lifetimes of the sensor. These results demonstrate the potential of
   biodegradable sensors to allow maintenance-free, affordable, and
   real-time soil moisture measurement at high spatial density for
   precision irrigation control.},

Abstract = {A new type of soil moisture sensor using spatial frequency domain
   transmissometry (SFDT) was evaluated. This sensor transmits and receives
   ultrawideband (1 to 6 GHz) radio waves between two separated antennas
   and measures the propagation delay time in the soil related to the
   dielectric constant. This method is expected to be less affected by air
   gaps between the probes and the soil, as well as being less affected by
   soil electrical conductivity (EC), than typical commercial sensors. The
   relationship between output and volumetric water content (theta), and
   the effects of air gaps and EC were evaluated through experiments using
   sand samples and the prototype SFDT sensor. The output of the SFDT
   sensor increased linearly with theta and was not affected by even a high
   salt concentration for irrigation water, such that the EC of the pore
   water was 9.2 dS.m(-1). The SFDT sensor was almost unaffected by
   polyethylene tapes wrapped around the sensor to simulate air gaps,
   whereas a commercially available capacitance sensor significantly
   underestimated theta. Theoretical models of the SFDT sensor were also
   developed for the calibration equation and the air gaps. The calculation
   results agreed well with the experimental results, indicating that
   analytical approaches are possible for the evaluation of the SFDT
   sensor.},

   calibrated the sensor for different soil dry bulk density and observed
   that the time taken by the soil moisture to penetrate from soil surface
   till 25 cm is around 10 mins and 57 mins when density is maintained at
   1.1 gm/cc and 1.3 gm/cc, respectively. We observed that the SMSMSP
   output changes only by 2.7 \% when the ambient temperature varies from
   20 degrees C to 60 degrees C. Both lab and field deployments results
   indicate that measured soil water content using SMSMSP at different

Abstract = {Maize production under smallholder systems in South Africa (RSA) depends
   on rainfall. Incidences of dry spells throughout the growing season have
   affected maize yields negatively. The study examined water distribution
   and water use efficiency (WUE) of maize rotated with two-year pigeonpea
   fallows as compared to continuous maize without fertilizer. A randomized
   complete block design, replicated three times, was used with four
   treatments, which included continuous unfertilized maize, natural
   fallow-maize, pigeonpea + grass-pigeonpea-maize, and two-year pigeonpea
   fallow-maize. Soil water mark sensors were installed 0.2; 0.5; and 1.2 m
   on each plot to monitor soil water tension (kPa). Soil samples were
   analyzed using pressure plates to determine water retention curves which
   were used to convert soil water tension to volumetric water content.
   Maize rotated with two-year pigeonpea fallows had higher dry matter
   yield (11,661 kg ha(-1)) and WUE (20.78 kg mm(-1)) than continuous maize
   (5314 kg ha(-1) and 9.48 kg mm(-1)). In this era of water scarcity and
   drought incidences caused by climate change, maize rotated with
   pigeonpea fallows is recommended among smallholder farmers in RSA
   because of its higher WUE, hence food security will be guaranteed.},

Month = {FEB 17},
Abstract = {Globally, farmers are seeking advanced precision technology to help
   transform their practices into a more sustainable and productive
   agri-tech process. Accurate and real-time soil data has become one of
   the most valuable resources among farmers. Real-time soil sensor data
   can be exploited in manners that increase farm production and profit,
   maintain and increase product quality, promote food security, and ensure
   environmental protection. Researchers have already attempted to develop
   real-time in situ soil nutrient sensors based on optical and
   electrochemical techniques. Of these sensor systems, only a few of them
   are commercially available for monitoring. In this review, we present
   both available sensors and sensors under research in agriculture. Then
   briefly discuss both advantages and challenges to overcome in order to
   produce systems that deliver real-time quality soil information. Optical
   and electrochemical sensors are becoming less expensive to manufacture
   and can provide results that are comparable to laboratory soil analysis.
   Based on the literature presented here, there still exists a need to
   understand the effects of soil heterogeneity on the analytical
   performance of both electrochemical and optical systems when used in
   situ. By doing so, these sensors can be fully adopted as suitable
   commercial platforms. Overall, these sensors harness the potential to
   revolutionize decision management systems in agriculture as internet of

Abstract = {This study develops an indirect method for the estimation of surface
   soil moisture (SM) by means of monitoring in situ soil water potential.
   Field work was carried out in ten sampling units selected according to

   through Kelvin's Law for each sampling unit. Water potential was used as
   input in the soil moisture retention curve for field conditions to

   of our approach, we measured the surface volumetric SM by the
   gravimetric method for 2,211 soil samples collected in the same survey

   Scale Using Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The timely and accurate estimation of soil water content (SWC) and
   evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance in drought estimation,
   irrigation management, and water resources comprehensive utilization.
   The unsupervised classification was used to identify the crops in the
   region. Based on MOD16A2 and the meteorological data, a SEBS model was
   used to estimate the ET in the Jiefangzha Irrigation Field from 2011 to
   2015. Based on the crop water stress index (CWSI), the SWC in 2014 was
   retrieved and verified with the measured SWC on different underlying
   surfaces (sunflower, corn, wheat, and pepper). The results showed that:
   (1) The positional accuracy of maize, sunflower, wheat, and pepper are
   0.81, 0.80, 0.90, and 0.82, respectively; (2) The annual ET from 2011 to
   2015 presented well the spatial distribution of the ET within the field;
   (3) The validation results of the estimated SWC on the underlying
   surface of wheat and sunflower showed a good robustness, the R-2 was
   0.748 and 0.357, respectively, the RMSE was 2.61\% and 2.309\%,
   respectively, and the MAE was 2.249\% and 1.975\%, respectively.
   However, for maize and pepper with more irrigation times, the SWC
   estimation results, based on the CWSI were poor, indicating that the
   method was more sensitive to soil drought and suitable for the crop SWC
   estimation with less irrigation and drought tolerance. The results can
   provide a reference for the agricultural water resources management and
   the irrigation forecast at a regional scale.},

Abstract = {Determination of an appropriate location for monitoring soil water
   content (SWC) is a key factor in efficient use of water in precision
   agriculture, however, the main challenge is the dynamic movement of
   water and root development in the soil profile. The objective of this
   study was investigating how SWC distribution in a loam soil profile at
   two growth stages of maize may impact the suitable location for SWC
   monitoring in a drip-tape irrigation system. A new concept, Average
   Moisture Representative Surface (AMRS) was proposed to determine the
   surface of the soil profile, which represent the average soil moisture
   of the wetted volume. SWC samples were taken during two irrigation
   intervals (48-52 days after planting (DAP) and 68-73 DAP) and root
   growth pattern was studied through root length density (RLD) at 50 and
   100 DAP. The results revealed that a non-uniform wetting pattern after
   irrigation limits the appropriate locations for SWC monitoring to point
   measurements and with time, SWC depletion resulted in enlarging AMRS. At
   the end of growing season, an increase of root growth around the
   drippers increased the variation of root water uptake in different soil
   layers, and thus optimal place for soil sensors was limited to the upper
   layers, where the maximum root water uptake occurred. Overall, it is
   recommended to install soil sensors, such as tensiometers and TDRs at a
   horizontal distance of 5-20 cm from the crop and a depth of 10-20 cm
   from the soil surface while drip-tape is aligned close to the maize row.

Abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) is a crucial parameter in ecology, agriculture,
   hydrology, and engineering studies. Research on non-invasive monitoring
   of SWC has been a long-lasting topic in these fields. Ground penetrating
   radar (GPR), a non-destructive geophysical technique, has the advantages
   of high resolution, deep detection depth, and high efficiency in SWC
   measurements at medium scale. It has been successfully applied in field
   investigations. This paper summarizes the recent progress in developing
   GPR-based SWC measurement methods, including reflected wave, ground
   wave, surface reflection, borehole GPR, full waveform inversion, average
   envelope amplitude, and frequency shift methods. The principles,
   advantages, limitations, and applications of these methods are described
   in detail. A comprehensive technical framework, which comprises the
   seven methods, is proposed to understand their principles and
   applicability. Two key procedures, namely, data acquisition and data
   processing, are emphasized as crucial to method applications. The
   suitable methods that will satisfy diverse application demands and field
   conditions are recommended. Future development, potential applications,
   and advances in hardware and data processing techniques are also
   highlighted.},

Title = {Uniplanar multirod TDR probe for soil water content measurement over a
   larger spatial scale},
Journal = {IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {73},

Abstract = {This study developed a uniplanar multirod time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) probe and evaluated it in laboratory experiments for soil water
   measurement over a larger spatial scale. The sampling volume of the
   probe was determined by simulating the electric potential distribution
   around the probe rods by using the HYDRUS-2D software package and
   verified by comparison with the measured dielectric constant in
   saturated sand. The performance of the probe was evaluated by comparing
   its dielectric measurements in wet sand over a wide range of water
   content during evaporative drying with that measured by CS640 probes.
   Additionally, the dependency of visible light reflection on the water
   content of the sand was evaluated. The results revealed that the average
   effective thickness of the probe's sampling volume was 5-6 cm on both
   sides of the plane of the probe rods. The probe accurately measured the
   soil water content over a 0.88 m2 spatial area. The visible light
   reflectance of the variably saturated sand surface and the corresponding
   water content of the sand follow a soil water retention function-type
   relationship. The usage of the multirod TDR measurement system at a
   larger spatial scale carries practical implications, especially in
   increasing the accuracy of remote sensing data.

   Neutron Probe Measurement},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Cosmic ray neutron probes (CRNPs) provide continuous monitoring of
   average near-surface soil water content (SWC) on hectometer scales.
   However, the performance of CRNPs on surfaces of highly heterogeneous
   vegetation and SWC remains uncertain. This study evaluated three
   vegetation calibration methods with the correction of vegetation
   distribution developed for a CRNP on the Loess Plateau of China. Three
   plots with different vegetation distributions were selected and equipped
   with CRNPs and SWC sensors, and their biomass as well as distribution
   were measured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a
   RedEdge multispectral camera. We found that the parameter N-0, which is
   neutron flux in dry soil, was best represented by the biomass at average
   growth conditions of the monitoring period, yielding the lowest RMSE
   (0.068). The Veg-N-0 vegetation calibration method reduced the RMSE the
   most between the CRNP SWC and the Kriging-weighted SWC, and the
   correction of the spatial distribution of the vegetation further reduced
   the RMSE. The cooperation between the CRNP and the UAV could obtain the
   regional averaged SWC accurately. This study makes up for the lack of
   vegetation calibration for the CRNP on the Loess Plateau, which should
   help develop sustainable vegetation management and ecohydrological
   management strategies on the Loess Plateau, so as to protect water
   security in the region.},

Title = {Efficient Irrigation of Maize Through Soil Moisture Monitoring and
   Modeling},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {3},
Month = {MAR 24},
Abstract = {Agriculture is the major user of water resources, accounting for 70\% of
   global freshwater demand. As the demand for clean water increases, so
   does the need to implement more efficient strategies for water
   management in irrigated agriculture. While the benefits of precision
   irrigation in high-value crops, such as cannabis, tomatoes, and
   potatoes, are fully recognized, there is still need to investigate and
   implement cheap and efficient irrigation strategies for widespread
   low-value crops such as maize. In this study, the soil moisture dynamics
   in a sprinkler-irrigated maize field in Veneto (Northeastern Italy) was
   monitored using six time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes for the
   entire growing season. The TDR sensors were positioned at different
   depths into two separate sites: an Uninformed Site irrigated based on
   the farmer's experience and an Informed Site in which a water balance
   irrigation strategy was applied based on soil moisture measurements. A
   parsimonious hydrological model was then implemented and calibrated to
   quantify the different water balance terms (precipitation,
   evapotranspiration, lateral fluxes, and deep percolation). The
   comparison between the water budget terms in the two sites highlights
   that soil moisture monitoring during agriculture activities leads to
   substantial savings in terms of irrigation water volumes requirements
   and cost, without compromising the productivity of the crop field. A
   simplified upscaling of the results at the regional scale, assuming
   average conditions as in this study site and growing season, reveals
   that potentially significant economic savings, compared to the total
   profits linked to maize crops, could be possible.},

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture content (SSMC) monitoring constitutes an important
   parameter to estimate crop water requirements, especially in arid and

   SSMC. Two approaches were applied for monitoring the SSMC during the

   using multispectral bands of Landsat-8 OLI images. The first approach
   examined the potential of visible and short-wave infrared drought index
   (VSDI), normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI) and short-wave
   infrared water stress index (SIWSI), to retrieve SSMC. The second
   approach attempted to develop a new SSMC model based on evaluation of
   the correlations between multispectral bands and measured SSMC using a
   stepwise multiple regression analysis. Results showed that the
   established model is highly correlated with the measured SSMC at all
   crop growth stages withR(2)of 0.87, 0.85 and 0.89, for bare soil,

Title = {An Improved UAV-Based ATI Method Incorporating Solar Radiation for
   Farm-Scale Bare Soil Moisture Measurement},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The use of UAV-based remote sensing for soil moisture has developed
   rapidly in recent decades, with advantages such as high spatial
   resolution, flexible work arrangement, and ease of operation. In bare
   and low-vegetation-covered soils, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI)
   method, which adopts thermal infrared data from UAV-based remote
   sensing, has been widely used for soil moisture estimation at the field
   scale. However, the ATI method may not perform well under inconsistent
   weather conditions due to inconsistency of the intensity of the soil
   surface energy input. In this study, an improvement of the ATI method
   (ATI-R), considering the variation in soil surface energy input, was
   developed by the incorporation of solar radiation measurements. The
   performances of the two methods were compared using field experiment
   data during multiple heating processes under various weather conditions.
   It showed that on consistently sunny days, both ATI-R and ATI methods
   obtained good correlations with the volumetric water contents (VWC)
   (R-ATI-R(2) = 0.775, RMSEATI-R = 0.023 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2)
   = 0.778, RMSEATI = 0.018 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)) on cloudy or a combination
   of sunny and cloudy days as long as there were significant soil-heating
   processes despite the different energy input intensities; the ATI-R
   method could perform better than the ATI method (cloudy: R-ATI-R(2) =
   0.565, RMSEATI-R = 0.024 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.156,
   RMSEATI = 0.033 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3); combined: R-ATI-R(2) = 0.673,
   RMSEATI-R = 0.028 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.310, RMSEATI =
   0.032 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)); and on overcast days, both the ATI-R and ATI
   methods could not perform satisfactorily (R-ATI-R(2) = 0.027, RMSEATI-R
   = 0.024 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.027, RMSEATI = 0.031
   cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)). The results indicate that supplemental solar
   radiation data could effectively expand applications of the ATI method,
   especially for inconsistent weather conditions.},

Title = {A multihead LSTM technique for prognostic prediction of soil moisture},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {433},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Prognostic prediction of soil moisture is a critical step in various
   fields such as geotechnical engineering, agriculture, geology,
   hydrology, and climatology. For example, in agricultural applications,
   soil moisture prediction is needed one-day and one-week ahead of time to
   optimize crop planting quality and set irrigation schedule,
   respectively. In soil and environmental management applications, soil
   moisture prediction is usually needed one-month ahead of time.
   Therefore, a capability to accurately forecast soil moisture is of
   paramount importance. For this purpose, deep learning methods,
   especially the long short-term memory network (LSTM) method, have been
   used extensively. It is shown that such models can successfully forecast
   the soil moisture for a short time frame in future, but their accuracy
   sharply decreases for long time frames. To resolve this issue, in this
   study, we present a multihead LSTM model that learns a number of
   hypotheses and aggregates them for prognostic prediction tasks. The
   multihead LSTM model is comprised of four LSTM models that digest time
   series data of soil moisture aggregated at different scales as inputs.
   The outputs of these models, i.e., predicted soil moisture at a certain
   time in future, are then combined using a weighted averaging method to
   obtain the final prediction values. Different statistical measures, such
   as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean
   absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and
   R-squared are employed to assess the performance of the multihead LSTM
   model predictions against the ground truth. The results show that the
   proposed multihead LSTM method is effective to forecast the soil
   moisture up to one-month in future with a R-squared value of 95.04\%.},

Abstract = {Agroforestry systems integrating tree and forage growth are important
   for maintaining soil health but may change the soil's physical-hydric
   properties. Our goal was to investigate the impact of introducing
   Eucalyptus trees into a pasture on the soil water content throughout the
   soil profile. The study was conducted in a 6-year-old agroforestry
   system where two species of Eucalyptus were introduced into a palisade
   grass pasture. Soil moisture was sampled at 0.0 (planting row), 2.0,
   4.0, and 6.0 m (midpoint between tree rows) from the Eucalyptus tree
   rows. A monoculture palisade grass pasture was used as a control. The
   soil water content down to a depth of 50 cm was lowest in the tree row
   and increased with distance from the trees. In the Eucalyptus row, the
   soil water content in the 0-50 cm layer was lower than in the
   monoculture pasture. Agroforestry systems decreased the water content in
   the superficial layers of the soil in the rainy months; in the dry
   season, the soil water contents in all layers were similar between the
   Eucalyptus inter-rows. In most seasons, the agroforest systems reduced
   the forage production close to the Eucalyptus tree rows, up to 2 m from
   the trees, likely due to the soil water content decrease. Overall, this
   study showed that in tropical regions with sandy soils, the grass and
   trees' competition must be considered when establishing integrated
   agroforestry systems in order to maximize the advantages and benefits of
   the diversified agroecosystem.},

   become viable in the last decade. However, state of the art SSM
   retrieval products suffer from very poor coverage over northern
   latitudes. In this study, we propose an innovative drought indicator
   with a wider spatial and temporal coverage than that obtained from
   satellite SSM retrievals. We evaluate passive microwave brightness
   temperature observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) satellite as a surrogate drought metric, and introduce a
   Standardized Brightness Temperature Index (STBI). We compute the STBI by
   fitting a Gaussian distribution using monthly brightness temperature
   data from SMOS; the normal assumption is tested using the Shapior-Wilk
   test. Our results indicate that the assumption of normally distributed
   brightness temperature data is valid at the 0.05 significance level. The
   STBI is validated against drought indices from a land surface data
   assimilation system (LDAS-Monde), two satellite derived SSM indices, one
   from SMOS and one from the ESA CCI soil moisture project and a
   standardized precipitation index based on in situ data from the European
   Climate Assessment \& Dataset (ECA\&D) project. When comparing the
   temporal dynamics of the STBI to the LDAS-Monde drought index we find
   that it has equal correlation skill to that of the ESA CCI soil moisture
   product (0.71). However, in addition the STBI provides improved spatial
   coverage because no masking has been applied over regions with dense
   boreal forest. Finally, we evaluate the STBI in a case study of the 2018
   Nordic drought. The STBI is found to provide improved spatial and
   temporal coverage when compared to the drought index created from
   satellite derived SSM over the Nordic region. Our results indicate that
   when compared to drought indices from precipitation data and a land data
   assimilation system, the STBI is qualitatively able to capture the 2018
   drought onset, severity and spatial extent. We did see that the STBI was
   unable to detect the 2018 drought recovery for some areas in the Nordic
   countries. This false drought detection is likely linked to the recovery
   of vegetation after the drought, which causes an increase in the passive
   microwave brightness temperature, hence the STBI shows a dry anomaly
   instead of normal conditions, as seen for the other drought indices. We
   argue that the STBI could provide additional information for drought
   monitoring in regions where the SSM retrieval problem is not well
   defined. However, it then needs to be accompanied by a vegetation index
   to account for the recovery of the vegetation which could cause false
   drought detection.},

Abstract = {To understand the influence of underground mining disturbances on the
   shallow soil moisture in the Daliuta coal mine, remote sensing
   monitoring of the temporal and spatial evolution of surface soil
   moisture and the influence of mining on multi-source, multi-temporal and
   high spatial resolution remote sensing data were carried out. The scale
   effect of monitoring the soil moisture at different scales was analyzed
   using the Scaled Soil Moisture Monitor Index (S-SMMI). In this paper,
   SPOT 5/6 and Worldview-2 were used as the data source and mainly made up
   two aspects of the research: 1) based on the three SPOT data sets with
   the use of S-SMMI from different angles from the Daliuta mine from
   nearly three years of soil moisture temporal and spatial changes, the
   results show that the perturbation has a negative effect on the shallow
   soil moisture in the Daliuta coal mine, and average soil moisture of the
   mining area is smaller than the nonmining area, but the surface
   ecological construction has effectively improved the impact of the
   underground mining disturbance on the surface soil moisture. 2) the
   scale conversion of Worldview-2 data was carried out based on the
   resampling method. S-SMMI was used to analyze the scale effect of soil
   moisture monitoring at different scales. The results show that the
   difference between the soil moisture is only 0.0016 during the
   conversion process of 2 m-30 m.},

Volume = {66},
Number = {2},
Pages = {253-261},
Abstract = {. Maintaining the economic and environmental sustainability of crop
   production requires optimizing irrigation management using advanced
   technologies such as soil water sensors. In this study, the performance
   of a commercially available multi-sensor capacitance probe was evaluated
   under irrigated field conditions across western Oklahoma. The effects of
   clay content and salinity on sensor performance were investigated too.
   In addition, the field capacity (FC) of soil cores collected at study
   sites was determined in the laboratory. These laboratory FC values were
   used to assess the performance of two sensor-based approaches for
   estimating FC: the days to reach laboratory FC after major watering
   events and the percentile of collected sensor readings that represented
   laboratory FC. The results showed that among the six calibrations
   provided by the manufacturer, the default and silty clay loam
   calibrations produced the largest and smallest soil water content
   errors, respectively. Errors generally increased with clay and salinity,
   except for the heavy clay calibration, which showed improved performance
   with increasing clay content. The default and sand calibrations were
   more sensitive to increases in clay and salinity compared to other
   calibrations. In the case of sensor-based FC, on average, one to three
   days were required to reach laboratory FC, with a large range of one to
   nine days. The percentiles representing laboratory FC had an average of
   56\% and a range of 3\%-97\%. Overall, the sensor-based approaches
   produced inconsistent and highly variable estimates of FC.},

Abstract = {In this work, we explored hierarchical MoS2 nanomaterials for soil
   moisture sensing (SMS) and tested their efficacy considering the
   operational aspects of the sensor. Carnation and marigold flower-like
   MoS2 nanostructures were prepared via facile hydrothermal processes with
   varying synthesis temperatures. The synthesized MoS2 nanostructures were
   well characterized by XRD, FTIR, FESEM, EDS, and HRTEM and it is evident
   that the variation in the hydrothermal temperatures has a significant
   impact on the crystallinity, morphology, stoichiometry, dimensions, and
   lattice spacing. We found that hierarchical MoS2 marigold flower-like
   nanostructures offer the highest sensitivity of about 2000 \%, when
   gravimetric water content (GWC) is varied from 1 \% to 20 \% GWC, which
   is one of the highest reported SMS. The sensors exhibit hysteresis of
   about +/- 4 \% and response times of about 500 s. They were highly
   selective to moisture compared to the other salts like Na, K, Cd, and Cu
   present in the soil. The sensors were also unaffected by changing
   temperatures with a small 2-4 \% between 20 degrees C and 65 degrees C.},

Title = {Soil moisture remote sensing using SIW cavity based metamaterial perfect
   absorber},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Continuous and accurate sensing of water content in soil is an essential
   and useful measure in the agriculture industry. Traditional sensors
   developed to perform this task suffer from limited lifetime and also
   need to be calibrated regularly. Further, maintenance, support, and
   deployment of these sensors in remote environments provide additional
   challenges to the use of conventional soil moisture sensors. In this
   paper, a metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) based soil moisture sensor
   is introduced. The ability of MPAs to absorb electromagnetic signals
   with near 100\% efficiency facilitates the design of highly accurate and
   low- profile radio frequency passive sensors. MPA based sensor can be
   fabricated from highly durable materials and can therefore be made more
   resilient than traditional sensors. High resolution sensing is achieved
   through the creation of physical channels in the substrate integrated
   waveguide (SIW) cavity. The proposed sensor does not require connection
   for both electromagnetic signals or for adding a testing sample.
   Importantly, an external power supply is not needed, making the MPA
   based sensor the perfect solution for remote and passive sensing in
   modern agriculture. The proposed MPA based sensor has three absorption
   bands due to the various resonance modes of the SIW cavity. By changing
   the soil moisture level, the absorption peak shifts by 10 MHz, 23.3 MHz,
   and 60 MHz, which is correlated with the water content percentage at the
   first, second and third absorption bands, respectively. Finally, a 6 x 6
   cell array with a total size of 312mm x 312mm has been fabricated and
   tested. A strong correlation between measurement and simulation results
   validates the design procedure.},

Title = {Machine Learning to Estimate Surface Soil Moisture from Remote Sensing
   Data},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is an integral quantity parameter in hydrology and
   agriculture practices. Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied
   to estimate surface soil moisture. However, it is still a challenge to
   retrieve surface soil moisture content (SMC) data in the heterogeneous
   catchment at high spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to
   improve the retrieval of SMC from remote sensing data, which is
   important in the planning and efficient use of land resources. Many
   methods based on satellite-derived vegetation indices have already been
   developed to estimate SMC in various climatic and geographic conditions.
   Soil moisture retrievals were performed using statistical and machine
   learning methods as well as physical modeling techniques. In this study,
   an important experiment of soil moisture retrieval for investigating the
   capability of the machine learning methods was conducted in the early
   spring season in a semi-arid region of Iran. We applied random forest
   (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and
   elastic net regression (EN) algorithms to soil moisture retrieval by
   optical and thermal sensors of Landsat 8 and knowledge of land-use types
   on previously untested conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran. The
   statistical comparisons show that RF method provided the highest
   Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value (0.73) for soil moisture retrieval
   covered by the different land-use types. Combinations of surface
   reflectance and auxiliary geospatial data can provide more valuable
   information for SMC estimation, which shows promise for precision
   agriculture applications.},

Abstract = {The research paper introduces the development of a soil moisture sensor

Volume = {15},
Pages = {2370-2378},
Abstract = {Precision agriculture is experiencing substantial development through
   the improved availability of cost-effective instruments for data
   collection. This includes ground-based proximal sensing technologies
   that are able to compete with satellite and aircraft observation
   systems, due to low operational costs, high operational flexibility, and
   high spatial resolution. This article was therefore designed to compare
   the performance of multiple sensing systems mounted on a smart buggy
   platform. A number of proximal sensing technologies were then evaluated
   and intercompared for their accuracy in retrieving high resolution
   near-surface soil moisture. The sensors tested included an L-band
   microwave radiometer (ELBARA III), a global navigation satellite system
   reflectometer sensor (LARGO), and an electromagnetic induction sensor
   (EM38). Data were collected during the fifth Soil Moisture Active
   Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) in Yanco, NSW, Australia, in September
   2015. Observations from each sensor were converted to surface soil
   moisture values which were in turn evaluated against reference
   measurements obtained by in situ soil moisture measurements. The sensing
   technologies tested here have been individually assessed by many other
   studies, but within different regions and environments including surface
   condition, local weather, observing height, size of footprint, etc.
   Consequently, this article has used a single platform to intercompare
   the different sensors to be evaluated concurrently. Results from this
   article indicated that the L-band microwave radiometer achieved the best
   performance in retrieving surface soil moisture. The average RMSE and R
   were found to be 0.055 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.68 for ELBARA III, 0.084
   cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.51 for LARGO, and 0.090 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.32 for the

Abstract = {Soil water content measurement is indispensable to precision

   consists of a monopole antenna to emit and receive electromagnetic waves
   as well as a network analyzer. The soil equivalent circuit model is
   presented and its spectroscopy is obtained by comparing incident and
   reflected waves. The results indicate that the resonance frequency
   shifts towards the low frequency region as soil moisture increases,
   therefore soil water content can be obtained simply by detecting
   resonance frequency. The linear fitting curve has a determination
   coefficient of 0.9834 and a root mean square error of 1.4\%. The
   measuring range from 5.0\% to 37.4\% is wide enough for actual

Volume = {359},

Abstract = {The traditional Brutsaert's model does not consider the influence of
   fixed Poisson's ratio on the accuracy of the model. Therefore, we extend
   Brutsaert's model by introducing Poisson's ratio dynamic solution model,
   and obtain the improved Brutsaert's model which considers the change of
   soil Poisson's ratio. The primary objective of this work was to explore
   whether improved Brutsaert's model (Poisson's ratio dynamic solution
   model is introduced) can more accurately predict soil volumetric water
   content (SVWC) than traditional Brutsaert's model. Acoustic velocities
   (the first compressional wave and shear wave) of natural silica sand
   (sand) and three different textures of farming soils (loam, sandy loam
   and clay loam) were measured using pulsed acoustic waves with
   frequencies less than 900 Hz under the conditions of wet swelling and
   drying shrinkage, respectively. The traditional Brutsaert's model and
   improved Brutsaert's model are validated by the measured acoustic
   velocities. We compare the result calculated by improved Brustsaert's
   model with that calculcated by traditional Brustsaert's model. The
   compared results show that the improved Brustsaert's model is more
   suitable for measuring the relationship between the velocity and the
   soil water content (SWC) than traditional Brustsaert's model in four
   different textures of soil samples. In order to verify the feasibility
   of the improved Brustsaert's model for predicting soil water content
   (SWC), field experiments were carried out on three kinds farming soil
   (loam, sandy loam and clay loam) sampling sites. The results show that
   the detected precision measured by improved Brustsaert's model was
   around 5\%.},

Title = {Remote sensing of vegetation and soil moisture content in Atlantic humid
   mountains with Sentinel-1 and 2 satellite sensor data},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {163},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The satellite monitoring of vegetation moisture content (VMC) and soil
   moisture content (SMC) in Southern European Atlantic mountains remains
   poorly understood but is a fundamental tool to better manage landscape
   moisture dynamics under climate change. In the Atlantic humid mountains
   of Portugal, we investigated an empirical model incorporating satellite
   (Sentinel-1 radar, S1; Sentinel-2 optical, S2) and ancillary predictors
   (topography and vegetation cover type) to monitor VMC (\%) and SMC (\%).
   Predictors derived from the S1 (VV, HH and VV/HH) and S2 (NDVI and NDMI)
   are compared to field measurements of VMC (n = 48) and SMC (n = 48)
   obtained during the early, mid and end of summer. Linear regression
   modelling was applied to uncover the feasibility of a landscape model
   for VMC and SMC, the role of vegetation type models (i.e. native forest,
   grasslands and shrubland) to enhance predictive capacity and the
   seasonal variation in the relationships between satellite predictors and
   VMC and SMC. Results revealed a significant but weak relationship
   between VMC and predictors at landscape level (R2 = 0.30, RMSEcv = 69.9
   \%) with S2\_NDMI and vegetation cover type being the only significant
   predictors. The relationship improves in vegetation type models for
   grasslands (R2 = 0.35, RMSEcv = 95.0 \% with S2\_NDVI) and shrublands
   conditions (R2 = 0.52, RMSEcv = 45.3 \%). A model incorporating S2\_NDVI
   and S1\_VV explained 52 \% of the variation in VMC in shrublands. The
   relationship between SMC and satellite predictors at the landscape level
   was also weak, with only the S2\_NDMI and vegetation cover type
   exhibiting a significant relationship (R2 = 0.28, RMSEcv = 18.9 \%).
   Vegetation type models found significant associations with SMC only in
   shrublands (R2 = 0.31, RMSEcv = 9.03 \%) based on the S2\_NDMI and
   S1\_VV/VH ratio. The seasonal analysis revealed however that predictors
   associated to VMC and SMC may vary over the summer. The relationships
   with VMC were stronger in the early summer (R2 = 0.31, RMSEcv = 90.1 \%;
   based on S2\_NDMI) and mid (R2 = 0.37, RMSEcv = 70.8 \%; based on
   S2\_NDVI), butnon-significant in the end of summer. Similar pattern was
   found for SMC, where the link with predictors decreases from the early
   summer (R2 = 0.33, RMSEcv = 16.0 \%; based on S1\_VH) and mid summer (R2
   = 0.30, RMSEcv = 17.8 \%; based on S2\_NDMI) to the end of summer
   (non-significant). Overall, the hypothesis of a universal landscape
   model for VMC and SMC was not fully supported. Vegetation type models
   showed promise, particularly for VMC in shrubland conditions. Sentinel
   optical and radar data were the most significant predictors in all
   models, despite the inclusion of ancillary predictors. S2\_NDVI,
   S2\_NDMI, S1\_VV and S1\_VV/VH ratio were the most relevant predictors
   for VMC and, to a lesser extent, SMC. Future research should quantify
   misregistration effects using plot vs. moving window values for the
   satellite predictors, consider meteorological control factors, and
   enhance sampling to overcome a main limitation of our study, small
   sample size.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter in determining crop growth and yield.
   Modern agriculture does not only take into account soil moisture
   measurements obtained once at selected points in the field, but also
   focuses on moisture monitoring. Knowledge of the variability over time
   and analysis of the variation in readings caused by heavy rainfall or
   strong sunshine and high soil temperature changes is very important for
   future modelling, prediction and automated irrigation. The aim of this
   paper is to present a developed soil moisture monitoring system for a
   soil profile up to 34 cm depth incorporating Internet of Things
   technologies. The system was built based on an eight-channel time domain
   reflectometer to measure soil moisture based on dielectric properties.
   The developed system integrates both dielectric moisture measurement and
   innovative web-based server and visualisation services. The autonomous
   station was equipped with a long-range wireless communication and a
   solar-charged battery. Analysis of the results enabled us to observe the
   subtle deviations of moisture content of the upper soil layer during
   diurnal cycles. The designed station can be used in the future to
   integrate a high accuracy automatic field irrigation system and acquire
   data for precision agriculture.},

Title = {Demonstrating the Potential of a Low-Cost Soil Moisture Sensor Network},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter of the climate system as it relates to
   plant transpiration and photosynthesis and impacts land-atmosphere
   interactions. Recent developments have seen an increasing number of
   electromagnetic sensors available commercially (EM) for soil volumetric
   water content (theta). Their use is constantly expanding, and they are
   becoming increasingly used for agricultural, ecological, and
   geotechnical applications and climate research, providing decision
   support and high-resolution data for models and machine-learning
   algorithms. In this study, a soil moisture sensor network consisting of
   10 Sense Cap capacitance-based sensors is evaluated. Analytical
   performance of the sensors was determined based on laboratory and field
   measurements with dielectric permittivity (epsilon) standards and soil
   media substrates. Sensor response normalisation to standards of known
   epsilon was found to reduce intersensor variability and provide robust
   estimates of theta in soil samples with known theta. Cross-comparison
   with a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) instrument carried out in two
   soil media demonstrates good agreement between the two probes throughout
   the tested range. The data communication performance of the network was
   evaluated in terms of packet drop rate at different ranges and sampling
   frequencies. It was noticed that the drop rate increased with distance
   from the gateway, while sampling frequency had no effect. Sources of
   errors associated with probe installation were identified and
   recommendations are provided for sensor deployment. The off-the-shelf
   all-in-one solution provided by Sense Cap is low cost, user friendly and
   suitable for implementation at temporal and spatial scales once the
   identified shortcomings are addressed. The evaluation presented aims to
   aid stakeholders and users involved in soil and land management
   practices including crop production, soil conservation, carbon
   sequestration and pollutants transport.},

Abstract = {The performance of a low-cost soil water content sensor (5TE, Decagon
   Devices, Inc.) for monitoring volumetric soil water content in an
   agricultural field was investigated. Prior to the in-field measurements,
   calibration methods for the sensor to correct the influences on soil
   temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil water were
   established. Dried soil collected from the agricultural field, pure
   water, and an in-laboratory thermostatic reservoir were used. First,
   calibration formulas for the soil temperature and EC were obtained using
   a dataset of laboratory measurements. Second, the soil water content in
   the field was measured using the 5TE sensor with three different
   calibration curves, applying: (A) no correction of EC for curves at 20
   degrees C, (B) temperature correction only, and (C) temperature and EC
   corrections. The differences between the sensor and actual measurements
   were (1) 2.5\%, (2) 2.5\%, and (3) 2.2\% expressed as volumetric soil
   water content (m3 m-3). Higher accuracy was confirmed in the 5TE-sensor
   measurements under condition (3) at higher EC values. Finally, we
   demonstrated that the 5TE sensor with the proposed calibration method is
   useful for monitoring soil water content in agricultural fields.},

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {71},
Abstract = {Precision farming technologies refer to a set of cutting-edge tools and
   strategies implemented to optimize the management of the plantation.
   Smart meter devices, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and wireless
   sensor networks (WSNs) are only a few examples of the innovative systems
   increasingly employed from an Agriculture 4.0 point of view. Recent
   literature has paid close attention to the role of artificial
   intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in helping farmers
   and improving soil productivity. In this regard, this article presents
   the design of a WSN based on low-cost, low-power photovoltaic
   (PV)-supplied sensor nodes able to acquire data regarding environmental
   conditions and soil parameters. Among all the implemented sensors, the
   most critical is the soil moisture sensors because of many issues
   related to cost, installation, reliability, and calibration. Thus, this
   article proposes a DL approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM)
   networks to provide a virtual soil moisture sensor using only the data
   acquired by the other transducer installed on the node. Performance
   estimation of the virtual sensors and an in-depth comparison with other
   learning-based approaches have been presented in this article to
   validate the effectiveness of the proposed soft sensing approach.},

Abstract = {Land surface temperature and fractional vegetation coverage (LST/FVC)
   space is a classical model for monitoring soil moisture (SMC) from
   optical/thermal remote sensing. However, its applications are critically
   constrained by the determination of the dry and wet boundaries. In this
   study, a semi-empirical method was provided for determining the dry
   boundary by introducing a parallel resistance following the Biome-BGC
   (BioGeochemical Cycles) model to determine the temperature endmembers on
   the dry boundary. The semi-empirical method was evaluated by comparing
   with typical theoretical calculation methods in calculating soil
   moisture index (SMI) based on the LST/FVC space. Public datasets from
   SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive mission Validation Experiment
   2012) experiment, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer),
   and NLDAS-2 (North American Land Data Assimilation System) Forcing
   Dataset were utilized in the evaluation. Results demonstrated that the
   semi-empirical method has comparable performances with the theoretical
   methods in monitoring the spatial variation of SMC. The SMIs based on
   the semi-empirical and theoretical methods are significantly correlated
   at a high level of Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) around 0.8-0.9
   with p-value = 0.05. More importantly, this semi-empirical method
   requires fewer parameters and does not require a complex iteration
   calculating process as compared with previous theoretical methods.},

Title = {The Met Office Operational Soil Moisture Analysis System},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In this study, the current Met Office operational land surface data
   assimilation system used to produce soil moisture analyses is presented.
   The main aim of including Land Surface Data Assimilation (LSDA) in both
   the global and regional systems is to improve forecasts of surface air
   temperature and humidity. Results from trials assimilating
   pseudo-observations of 1.5 m air temperature and specific humidity and
   satellite-derived soil wetness (ASCAT) observations are analysed. The
   pre-processing of all the observations is described, including the
   definition and construction of the pseudo-observations. The benefits of
   using both observations together to produce improved forecasts of
   surface air temperature and humidity are outlined both in the winter and
   summer seasons. The benefits of using active LSDA are quantified by the
   root mean squared error, which is computed using both surface
   observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   (ECMWF) analyses as truth. For the global model trials, results are
   presented separately for the Northern (NH) and Southern (SH)
   hemispheres. When compared against ground-truth, LSDA in winter NH
   appears neutral, but in the SH it is the assimilation of ASCAT that
   contributes to approximately a 2\% improvement in temperatures at lead
   times beyond 48 h. In NH summer, the ASCAT soil wetness observations
   degrade the forecasts against observations by about 1\%, but including
   the screen level pseudo-observations provides a compensating benefit. In
   contrast, in the SH, the positive effect comes from including the ASCAT
   soil wetness observations, and when both observations types are
   assimilated there is a compensating effect. Finally, we demonstrate
   substantial improvements to hydrological prediction when using land
   surface data assimilation in the regional model. Using the
   Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) metric as an aggregated measure of river
   flow simulation skill relative to observations, we find that NSE was
   improved at 106 of 143 UK river gauge locations considered after LSDA
   was introduced. The number of gauge comparisons where NSE exceeded 0.5
   is also increased from 17 to 28 with LSDA.},

Abstract = {Electromagnetic sensors are widely used to monitor soil water content
   (theta); however, site-specific calibrations are necessary for accurate
   measurements. This study compares regression models used for calibration
   of soil moisture sensors and investigates the relation between soil
   attributes and the adjusted parameters of the specific calibration
   equations. Undisturbed soil samples were collected in the A and B
   horizons of two Ultisols and two Inceptisols from the Mantiqueira Range
   in Southeastern Brazil. After saturation, the Theta Probe ML2X was used
   to obtain the soil dielectric constant (e). Several readings were made,
   ranging from saturation to oven-dry. After each reading, the samples
   were weighted to calculate. (m3 m-3). Fourteen regression models
   (linear, linearized, and nonlinear) were adjusted to the calibration
   data and checked for their residue distribution. Only the exponential
   model with three parameters met the regression assumptions regarding
   residue distribution. The stepwise regression was used to obtain
   multiple linear equations to estimate the adjusted parameters of the
   calibration model from soil attributes, with silt and clay contents
   providing the best relations. Both the specific and the general
   calibrations performed well, with RMSE values of 0.02 and 0.03 m(3)
   m(-3), respectively. Manufacturer calibration and equations from the
   literature were much less accurate, reinforcing the need to develop
   specific calibrations.},

Abstract = {Accurate and timely evaluation of soil water content (SWC) in
   water-limited arid and semiarid regions will provide an essential
   reference for scientifically based water management strategies and
   vegetation restoration practices. Theoretical and empirical models based
   on remote sensing data have been successfully applied to predict
   large-scale SWC. However, most existing models are limited to the
   surface soil layer, while the prediction of SWC in the deep soil layer
   (1-5 m) has been overlooked because of the shortage of long-term and
   large-scale filed-observed data. In this study, a south-north transect
   (ca. 860 km) was selected across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Based
   on both long-term remote sensing and in-situ data (2013-2016),
   pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for the SWC in the 0-5 m profile were
   developed using multiple regression, random forest, and artificial
   neural network. The results showed that evapotranspiration, potential
   evapotranspiration, soil surface temper-ature, total shortwave broadband
   albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index were important remote
   sensing parameters, whereas soil texture and bulk density were important
   in-situ parameters for SWC PTFs development. Among the three PTF
   development methods, machine learning (i.e. random forest and artificial
   neural network) obtained a higher accuracy than multiple regression. For
   different combinations of input pa-rameters, the introduction of in-situ
   factors significantly improved the accuracy of PTFs compared with PTFs
   based on remote sensing data only. The artificial neural network
   developed a PTF with only five input variables that predicted SWC with
   reasonable accuracy (root mean square error symbolscript 0.039, R2
   symbolscript 0.697, mean absolute percentage symbolscript 24.8) and is
   thus useful for many applications on the Loess Plateau of China. In the
   future, more attention should be given to the role of in-situ parameters
   when developing PTFs for deep SWC prediction.},

Title = {Monitoring of Soil Nutrient Levels by an EC Sensor during Spring Onion
   (<i>Allium fistulosum</i>) Cultivation under Different Fertilizer
   Treatments},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Balanced nutrients are essential for healthy plant growth, but there is
   no sensor available to monitor essential nutrients such as N and K.
   Electrical conductivity (EC) is one of the key parameters that could be
   adopted to monitor nutrient contents because soil EC is influenced by
   the available nutrients. Therefore, the main objective of this study was
   to examine the effects of different basal fertilizers, including
   inorganic, organic, and compost fertilizers, and the application ratio
   of basal and additional fertilizers on nutrient contents with an EC
   sensor. The applied basal and additional fertilizer ratios were N 30:70,
   K 40:60, and N 20:80, K 20:80, respectively, for each fertilizer
   treatment. The results showed that the EC sensor value was positively
   associated with water content. The soil EC response increased with
   inorganic fertilizer and fertigation, and it was positively correlated
   with soluble nutrients and exchangeable ammonium. The correlation
   coefficients between sensor EC and soluble nutrients, nitrate, and
   ammonium nitrogen were 0.87, 0.86, and 0.65, respectively. The principal
   component analysis (PCA) also elucidated that inorganic fertilizer was
   positively associated with sensor EC, soluble Na, Ca, Mg, and nitrate
   among variables. This work suggests that soil available nutrients,
   especially N, could be monitored with an EC sensor, and the soil
   nutrient status could be regulated to promote better plant growth.},

Title = {Sensors and frequencies of soil water content measurement affecting
   agro-hydrological simulations and irrigation management},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {194},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Principles and frequency of soil water content (SWC) measurements used
   in the transient water flow experiments may cause distinction on the
   determination of soil hydraulic properties (SHP) by inverse modelling
   (IM). Consequently, use of agro-hydrological models and irrigation
   management can be affected. This work has the following objectives: (i)
   to analyze if the type of sensor and the frequency of SWC measurement
   used in the transient water flow experiments for IM affect the results
   regarding SHP; (ii) to assess if variations on the SWC measurement
   frequencies affect the results of SHP to the point of causing effects on
   the agro-hydrological modelling through SWAP model and on the passion
   fruit irrigation management based on soil water sensing; (iii) point out
   strategies for the correct irrigation management based on SHP obtained
   by IM. The results regarding SHP were applied to the modelling of crop
   evapotranspiration (ETc) and SWC with the use of SWAP agro-hydrological
   model. The type of sensor and the frequency of SWC data measurements
   interfered in the results regarding SHP obtained by IM, with
   implications on the agro-hydrological modelling and on the irrigation
   management through soil water sensing (SWS). The results of this study
   alert for the differences that may occur in SWC values when those are
   obtained from matric potential through soil water retention curves. This
   is specially important for higher and lower critical matric potentials
   used as reference for the moment to turn on and off a irrigation. When
   using GS1 sensors for IM, it is recommended to use intervals of SWC data
   measurement of 1 h, as the TDR sensors performed better with SWC data
   acquisition frequency between 1 and 12 h. Finally, it is understood that
   the factors that affect agro-hydrological modeling and the performance
   of the type of soil water sensor are diverse and integrated in a complex
   nonlinear way, for instance: atmospheric condition, soil texture and
   structure, topography, presence/absence of plants, soil and irrigation
   management practices. Thus, similar studies should be carried out
   considering variations in these factors so that a generalist and
   integrated conclusion is possible.},

Abstract = {Soil incubation and pot experiments were conducted to follow the
   sorption processes of added phosphorus (P) fertiliser using the
   radioisotope tracer technique. Increasing doses of P fertiliser (40, 80,
   160, 320 mg P/kg soil) were added to Chernozem and Arenosol and
   incubated for 1, 3, and 13 weeks. After incubation, perennial ryegrass
   (Lolium perenne L.) was sown in one group of pots, and the experiment
   had been continuing for another 9 weeks. The yield, grass P uptake,
   isotopically exchangeable (P-IE), water-soluble (P-W), and ammonium
   lactate soluble phosphorus (P-AL) fractions of soils were measured. On
   Chernozem, plant P uptake, P-IE, P-W and P-AL were significantly less in
   the case of the longest incubation period compared to shorter
   incubations. This suggests a transformation of P into tightly sorbed
   form. On Arenosol, there were only small changes in the parameters as
   the incubation period increased, suggesting less intense P
   transformation to tightly sorbed form. The P-W/P-IE ratio enhanced with
   increasing P-doses, and the ratios were higher on Arenosol. On Arenosol,
   the higher P doses caused a greater increase of PW than on Chernozem.
   The P-IE + P-W showed a good correlation with plant P uptake proving
   this value can be a good indicator of plant-available phosphorus.},

Title = {Data assimilation of high-resolution thermal and radar remote sensing
   retrievals for soil moisture monitoring in a drip-irrigated vineyard},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {239},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Efficient water use assessment and irrigation management is critical for
   the sustainability of irrigated agriculture, especially under changing
   climate conditions. Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground
   instrumentation over wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical
   model-based fine-scale mapping of soil water conditions have been
   applied for water resource applications at a range of spatial scales.
   Here, we present a prototype framework for integrating high-resolution
   thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing
   data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model with the
   aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil
   moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies.
   Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and
   surface soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m
   resolution SVAT model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of
   California, U.S. The efficacy of our data assimilation algorithm is
   investigated via both the synthetic and real data experiments. Results
   demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is superior to an
   ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship between
   model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such
   as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between
   observations and states and must therefore be represented accurately in
   the assimilation model. Overall, both surface and root-zone soil
   moisture predicted via the SVAT model are enhanced through the
   assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals, suggesting the
   potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural
   sub-field-scale using a data assimilation strategy.},

Abstract = {Excessive tillage operations under inadequate conditions can raise the
   cost of agricultural production and lead to soil degradation without
   adequate crop response. The objective of this study was to evaluate the
   onion crop response to soil water contents and tillage systems. Three
   tillage systems were evaluated: P1 (plowing + two harrowings + two
   seedbed raising operations), P2 (two harrowings + one seedbed raising
   operation), P3 (one harrowing + one seedbed raising operation); and four
   soil water contents: 12, 15, 23 and 26\%. The experiment was conducted
   in the irrigated perimeter of Tourao, Juazeiro, BA, Brazil (9 degrees
   24' 7.3 `' S; 40 degrees 26' 8.7 `' W and altitude of 368 m), in 2017,
   and was installed in split plots, in a randomized block design, with
   four repetitions. Water contents were arranged in the plots and tillage
   systems in the subplots. Crop response to the applied treatments was
   evaluated through the determination of the emergence speed index of the
   seedlings, regularity of the longitudinal distribution of seedlings,
   final stand, total and marketable yields of the crop and yield per bulb
   transverse diameter class. The variation of soil water content had a
   quadratic effect on the variables emergence speed index, final stand and
   total onion yield. The treatments did not significantly affect the
   longitudinal distribution of plants and marketable yield. The tillage
   system composed of one harrowing and one seedbed raising operation
   showed to be the most appropriate for onion cultivation by direct

   Salinity Measurements Using the 5TE Sensor},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Capacitance sensors are widely used in agriculture for irrigation and
   soil management purposes. However, their use under saline conditions is
   a major challenge, especially for sensors operating with low frequency.
   Their dielectric readings are often biased by high soil electrical
   conductivity. New calculation approaches for soil water content (theta)
   and pore water electrical conductivity (ECp), in which apparent soil
   electrical conductivity (ECa) is included, have been suggested in recent
   research. However, these methods have neither been tested with low-cost
   capacitance probes such as the 5TE (70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman,
   WA, USA) nor for field conditions. Thus, it is important to determine
   the performance of these approaches and to test the application range
   using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soils. For this purpose, sandy soil
   was collected from the Jemna oasis in southern Tunisia and four 5TE
   sensors were installed in the field at four soil depths. Measurements of
   apparent dielectric permittivity (Ka), ECa, and soil temperature were
   taken under different electrical conductivity of soil moisture
   solutions. Results show that, under field conditions, 5TE accuracy for
   theta estimation increased when considering the ECa effect. Field
   calibrated models gave better theta estimation (root mean square error
   (RMSE) = 0.03 m(3) m(-3)) as compared to laboratory experiments (RMSE =
   0.06 m(3) m(-3)). For ECp prediction, two corrections of the Hilhorst
   model were investigated. The first approach, which considers the ECa
   effect on K' reading, failed to improve the Hilhorst model for ECp > 3
   dS m(-1) for both laboratory and field conditions. However, the second
   approach, which considers the effect of ECa on the soil parameter K-0,
   increased the performance of the Hilhorst model and gave accurate
   measurements of ECp using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soil.},

   greater than background noise assuming the reflector height is
   inconstant in each day, (3) assuming the reflector height is constant
   and median values are used for overall estimations in each day, (4)
   assuming the reflector height is constant and median values are used in

   method was implemented to the data of OSOR station, installed in Chile
   (within the scope of the CAP Andes GPS Network Project carried out by
   UNAVCO), during 213 days from 01 January 2015 to 31 July 2015.
   Validation of the estimates is done by the recorded soil moistures from

Abstract = {A standard management soil priming effect is short term. A current soil
   plowing, irrigation and waste utilization soil priming action
   shortcomings elimination is needed. The Biogeosystem Technique (BGT{*})
   priming action system was developed for soil management to provide a
   higher-level priming effect. The BGT{*} is focused on a soil
   biogeochemical cycle activation similar to the biodegradation in a colon
   of a live organism as an efficient benchmark bioreactor. Fluorescence in
   situ hybridization showed a cooperation of bacteria within polymicrobial
   biofilms and a probability of the polymicrobial biofilms biodegradation
   process acceleration and soil organic matter (SOM) regime improvement.
   The soil priming actions the BGT{*} technological management is capable
   of providing are based on the BGT{*} constituents, whose essence,
   applications and corresponding detailed data are presented in available
   studies. The main BGT{*} components are as follows. The illuvial horizon
   intra-soil milling artificial soil aggregation (a form of crumbling and
   mixing) priming action provides the soil structuring, a SOM content
   increase and an annual yield increment direct priming effects. A
   long-term secondary priming effect is a technology life cycle with
   higher profitability compared to the standard moldboard, chiseling and
   three-tier plowing. The intra-soil pulse sequential-discrete watering
   priming action is performed through water injection into the soil in
   sequence. A next water spreading provides the soil aggregate stability,
   the seedling length and weight increment direct priming effect and a
   water-saving secondary priming effect. The intra-soil dispersed liquid,
   paste-like and loose granular nutrition and structuring matter
   intra-soil milling application priming action ensures soil structuring
   direct priming effects, heavy metals passivation and long-term yield
   increment secondary priming effects. The BGT{*} methodology could be
   useful for soil management improvement.},

Abstract = {To minimize the damage caused by slope failure, knowledge of the
   increase in water content in mountain soil is important. Our group has
   been studying miniaturized impedance sensors for multipoint measurements
   in soil. Conventional sensors with a SiNx top film sometimes cannot
   detect changes in the water content in soil resulting from rain.
   Experiments on the slide distances of water droplets were performed
   using SiOx and SiNx films. As the slide distance of the SiOx film was
   shorter than that of the SiNx film, it was confirmed that the SiOx film
   is more hydrophilic than the SiNx film. To improve contact
   characteristics between the sensor surface and free water in soil, we
   covered our conventional sensor chip with a hydrophilic SiOx film. As a
   contact property test, the sensor chip measured the impedances of model
   soils. The proposed sensor achieved stable contact with the free water
   in the soil. Moreover, the chip operated for a long period of time on a
   mountain slope. The sensor could measure nearly theoretical outputs in
   response to rainfall. Thus, we succeeded in fabricating a stable soil
   monitor sensor with a hydrophilic SiOx film.},

Title = {Effects of moss biocrusts on near-surface soil moisture are
   underestimated in drylands: Insights from a heat-pulse soil moisture
   sensor},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {413},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Understanding the physical, chemical, and biological processes and
   estimating water balance in drylands rely on accurate soil moisture
   (theta) measurements. Surface soil moisture is influenced by the
   presence and types of biocrusts because they strongly modify surface
   soil properties and hydrological processes. Nevertheless, it is still a
   challenge to precisely measure the theta of such thin biocrust layer and
   to evaluate biocrusts' roles in soil water balance. Due to the large
   sensing range (usually >= 5 cm), the most dielectric soil moisture
   sensors are incapable of accurately measuring near-surface (<= 5 cm)
   theta, although they have been widely used for this purpose. Conversely,
   the heat-pulse (HP) sensor possibly performs better in measuring surface
   theta of biocrust layer because of its smaller sensing range (1.2 cm).
   In this study, we assessed the performance of HP sensor in investigating
   the surface theta differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare
   soil on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau. We measured surface theta of
   biocrusts and bare soil for one year at 1 cm depth using HP sensors, and
   at 2 or 5 cm depths using three common dielectric sensors based on
   alternative measurement principles. Our results showed that the
   relationship of theta and heat capacity from the HP sensor was quite
   well-fitted by a linear regression function (R-2 = 0.96), and the theta
   measured by HP sensor in the field agreed well with the oven-drying 0
   (root-mean-square error <= 0.015 cm(3) cm(-3) and mean deviation < 0.007
   cm(3) cm(-3)). The HP sensor measured a 44\% greater theta under
   biocrusts compared to bare soil throughout the experimental period, in
   contrast to lesser differences detected with the other sensors
   (17\%-33\%). Furthermore, the biocrust increased theta by 100\% in the
   dry season (Nov.-Apr.) and by 40\% in the wet season (May-Oct.) in
   contrast to bare soil based on the HP sensor. Moreover, the theta of
   biocrusts measured by HP sensor was 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) higher than that
   of bare soil under the periods without rainfall, but the biocrusts
   increased theta by 0.05-0.10 cm(3) cm(-3) in contrast to bare soil after
   rainfall. The apparent differences among different types of sensors were
   reasonably attributed to their variable sensing ranges and volumes of
   measured soil. Although the installation depths were different among HP
   sensor and dielectric sensors, HP sensor was undoubtedly more suitable
   in measuring near-surface theta and sensitive enough to detect even
   non-rainfall water inputs (dew, fog, and water vapor sorption) into the
   soil. In conclusion, the theta differences between moss-dominated
   biocrusts and bare soil are mostly underestimated by common dielectric
   sensors compared to HP sensors. Therefore, biocrusts play a more vital
   role in surface water balance of drylands than we generally recognized
   before.},

Abstract = {In early satellite mission design, requirements are not yet fixed, cost
   is sometimes negotiable, and designs are relatively unconstrained.
   During this period of design freedom, multi-objective optimization can
   provide a useful lens into the design space by showing theoretical
   performance limits and illuminating design tradeoffs. This work
   optimizes a radar constellation for a potential soil moisture mission.
   Several different optimization cases with different variables are
   considered and contrasted. The optimization of the instrument and
   constellation parameters is considered jointly and separately to better
   understand the effect of coupling on the optimization performance. A
   science-driven optimization based on soil moisture retrieval error is
   compared with a performance-metric-driven optimization. Pareto analysis
   and association rule mining are performed on the generated designs to
   provide insight into driving features. Design recommendations are made
   for several cost caps. Results show that optimization that considers the
   instrument and constellation design together find superior revisit
   metrics than treating instrument and constellation separately. The use
   of the science value metric as an optimization objective shows that
   while cost may always be increased to improve instrument and
   constellation performance, the difference in science value may be
   negligible. These findings can inform tradespace exploration studies for
   similar problems.},

Abstract = {Precise and quick estimates of soil moisture content for the purpose of
   irrigation scheduling are fundamentally important. They can be
   accomplished through the continuous monitoring of moisture content in
   the root zone area, which can be accomplished through automatic soil
   moisture sensors. Commercial soil moisture sensors are still expensive
   to be used by famers, particularly in developing countries, such as
   Egypt. This research aimed to design and calibrate a locally
   manufactured low-cost soil moisture sensor attached to a smart
   monitoring unit operated by Solar Photo Voltaic Cells (SPVC). The
   designed sensor was evaluated on clay textured soils in both lab and
   controlled greenhouse environments. The calibration results demonstrated
   a strong correlation between sensor readings and soil volumetric water
   content (theta(V)). Higher soil moisture content was associated with
   decreased sensor output voltage with an average determination
   coefficient (R-2) of 0.967 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.014.
   A sensor-to-sensor variability test was performed yielding a 0.045
   coefficient of variation. The results obtained from the real conditions
   demonstrated that the monitoring system for real-time sensing of soil
   moisture and environmental conditions inside the greenhouse could be a
   robust, accurate, and cost-effective tool for irrigation management.},

Title = {5G wideband on-chip dipole antenna for WSN soil moisture monitoring},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RF AND MICROWAVE COMPUTER-AIDED ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Recently, soil dielectric constant detection has been used in the
   irrigation of vastly differing farming conditions. Soil monitoring has
   seen a push toward fifth generation (5G) telecommunications technology,
   due to the higher speed and bandwidth required to connect a huge number
   of sensor nodes simultaneously. A novel architecture for a fully
   integrated, unequal arms dipole antenna is presented in this article.
   The proposed on-chip antenna is implemented using UMC180 nm CMOS
   technology. A dipole radiator is added on the upper metal layer, a
   ground sheet set at the lower metal layer and a patch layer is added on
   the intermediate metal layer. This configuration has improved the
   antenna impedance bandwidth by 38\%. In addition, it increased the
   electrical length of the dipole antenna to reduce the antenna resonant
   frequency by 10 GHz. The proposed antenna has a total area 1300 x 250 mu
   m, and its wide bandwidth extends from 21 to 40 GHz at reflection
   coefficient |S-11| < -7 dB, which makes it suitable for on-chip wireless
   sensor network applications in 5G technology. All Simulations are
   completed by using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency structure simulator)
   ver.15 and the simulated results show a good comparison with
   measurements. To investigate the proposed antenna's performance in
   different environmental conditions, practical measurements for soil
   dielectric constant in different compositions with variable moisture
   ratios are applied. The resulting values are used in antenna simulation
   and have ultimately proved the antenna's improved capability to sense
   soil moisture in different conditions.},

Abstract = {Wide-area soil moisture sensing is a key element for smart irrigation
   systems. However, existing soil moisture sensing methods usually fail to
   achieve both satisfactory mobility and high moisture estimation
   accuracy. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a
   novel soil moisture sensing system, named as SoilId, that combines a UAV
   and a COTS IR-UWB radar for wide-area soil moisture sensing without the
   need of burying any battery-powered in-ground device. Specifically, we
   design a series of novel methods to help SoilId extract soil moisture
   related features from the received radar signals, and automatically
   detect and discard the data contaminated by the UAV's uncontrollable
   motion and the multipath interference. Furthermore, we leverage the
   powerful representation ability of deep neural networks and carefully
   design a neural network model to accurately map the extracted radar
   signal features to soil moisture estimations. We have extensively
   evaluated SoilId against a variety of real-world factors, including the
   UAV's uncontrollable motion, the multipath interference, soil surface
   coverages, and many others. Specifically, the experimental results
   carried out by our UAV-based system validate that SoilId can push the
   accuracy limits of RF-based soil moisture sensing techniques to a 50\%
   quantile MAE of 0.23\%.},

Abstract = {The forests of central Germany (Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, and Thuringia)
   are vital components of the local ecosystems, the economy, and
   recreation. However, in recent years, these forests have faced
   significant challenges due to prolonged climate-change-induced droughts,
   causing water shortages, tree stress, and pest outbreaks. One of the key
   components of the forests' vitality and productivity is the availability
   of soil moisture. Given the anticipated increase in the frequency and
   severity of drought events, there is a growing demand for accurate and
   real-time soil moisture information. This underscores the need for
   development of an appropriate monitoring tool to make forest management
   strategies more effective.The article introduces an operational
   high-resolution soil moisture monitoring framework for the forests in
   central Germany. The key components of this system include the advanced
   LWF-BROOK90 1D water balance model, a large database of the National
   Federal Forest Inventory, high-resolution forest soil maps, real-time
   climate data from the German Meteorological Service, and a web
   information platform for the presentation of daily updated results. This
   system informs the public and empowers forest managers and other
   decision-makers to take targeted, local measures for sustainable forest
   management, aiding in both drought mitigation and long-term forest
   health in the face of climate change. The validation of the system using
   soil moisture measurements from 51 stations with various sensor depths
   (up to 100 cm) showed an overall good agreement (0.76 median Pearson
   correlation), which was found to be higher for deciduous rather than
   coniferous forests. Finally, the framework is discussed against the
   background of the main limitations of existing monitoring systems and
   how operational soil moisture measurements contribute to better
   interpretation of simulations.},

Abstract = {Although satellite-based soil moisture products are useful at regional

   event captured by a novel L-band radiometer onboard a Black Swift
   Technologies fixed-wing S2 UAS. A fallow cornfield at the Beltsville
   Agricultural Research Center was selected as a study area to validate
   volumetric soil moisture estimates in mid-April. By leveraging a
   comparable radiative transfer model to that of soil moisture active
   passive and soil moisture ocean salinity derived products, brightness
   temperature retrievals from this sensor are shown to successfully
   capture a week of dry-down poststorm event, as validated by HydraGO
   probe estimates (calibrated with gravimetric samples) and a nearby soil
   climate analysis network station. However, with a reported spatially
   averaged bias of -0.107 m(3)/m(3) (compared to calibrated moisture
   values) and an ubRMSE of 0.028 m(3)/m(3) potential concerns remain
   regarding the sensor calibration, vegetation and surface roughness
   corrections, and georeferencing. Nevertheless, given the potential of
   UAS for on-demand, high-resolution soil moisture retrievals, this
   collaborative effort provides critical feedback for informing future

Abstract = {In the study, Vis-NIR hyperspectral imaging technique was investigated
   for non-destructive determination of soil moisture content. A total of
   208 spectral information of soil samples by hyperspectral imaging system
   were collected. The differences between soil's moisture content and
   spectral changes were compared. Different methods of spectral data
   preprocessing methods, characteristic wavelengths extraction, and
   building models had influences on the performance of model established.
   Results from this investigation demonstrated that the reflectivity of
   soil spectrum were declining with the increase of soil moisture content.
   Once soil moisture content reached the limit of the field water holding
   capacity, the reflectivity of soil spectrum were increasing with the
   increase of soil moisture content. The methods of different pretreatment
   were analyzed, and the pretreatment method of normalization of unit
   vector was proposed. The number of characteristic wavelengths extracted
   by the method of uninformative variable eliminate (UVE), competitive
   adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS), beta coefficient (beta), successive
   projections algorithm (SPA) were 49, 30, 5, 7, respectively. In order to
   reduce data redundancy, characteristic wavelengths extracted by the
   method of UVE and CARS were further extracted by SPA method. The number
   of characteristic wavelengths extracted by the method of UVE + SPA and
   CARS + SPA were 5, 8, respectively. The MLR model built based on the
   characteristic wavelengths extracted by the ss coefficient was chosen as
   the best model, which of the optimal characteristic wavelengths were
   411, 440, 622, 713, 790 nm, respectively. The correlation coefficient (
   Rp) and the root mean square error (RMSEP) for prediction set were 0.979

Abstract = {This study was undertaken to derive textural and lumped site-specific
   calibration equations for Dirk Friedhelm Mercker (DFM) capacitance
   probes and evaluate the accuracy levels of the developed calibration
   equations for continuous soil moisture monitoring in three selected soil
   types. At each site, 9 probes (3 per plot) were installed in 2 m(2)
   plots, for continuous soil moisture measurements at 5 different depths
   (viz. 10, 20, 30, 40 and 60 cm) under dry, moist and wet field
   conditions. Textural site-specific calibration equations were derived by
   grouping the same soil textural classes of each site regardless of soil
   depth, while lumped site-specific calibration equations were derived by
   grouping all datasets from each site, regardless of soil depth and
   textural classes. Sensor readings were plotted against gravimetrically
   measured volumetric soil moisture (theta(v)) for different textural
   classes as a reference. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) was used
   to select the best fit of the regression function. The developed
   calibration equations were evaluated using an independent dataset. The
   results indicated that all developed textural and lumped site-specific
   calibration equations were linear functions, with r(2) values ranging
   from 0.96 to 0.99. Relationships between the measured and estimated. v
   from calibration equations were reasonable at all sites, with r(2)
   values greater than 0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) values
   ranging from 0.010 to 0.020 m(3).m(-3). The results also indicated that
   textural site-specific calibration equations (RMSE < 0.018 m(3).m(-3))
   should be given preference over lumped site-specific calibrations (RMSE
   < 0.020 m(3).m(-3)) to attain more accurate. v measurements. The
   findings of this study suggest that once DFM capacitance probes are
   calibrated per site, they can be reliably used for accurate in-situ soil
   moisture measurements. The developed calibration equations can be
   applied with caution in other sites with similar soil types to attained
   reliable in-situ soil moisture measurements.},

Title = {Remote sensing-based vegetation and soil moisture constraints reduce
   irrigation estimation uncertainty},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Understanding the human water footprint and its impact on the
   hydrological cycle is essential to inform water management under climate
   change. Despite efforts in estimating irrigation water withdrawals in
   earth system models, uncertainties and discrepancies exist within and
   across modeling systems conditioned by model structure, irrigation
   parameterization, and the choice of input datasets. Achieving model
   reliability could be much more challenging for data-sparse regions,
   given limited access to ground truth for parameterization and
   validation. Here, we demonstrate the potential of utilizing remotely
   sensed vegetation and soil moisture observations in constraining
   irrigation estimation in the Noah-MP land surface model. Results
   indicate that the two constraints together can effectively reduce model
   sensitivity to the choice of irrigation parameterization by 7\%-43\%. It
   also improves the characterization of the spatial patterns of irrigation
   and its impact on evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture by
   correcting for vegetation conditions and irrigation timing. This study
   highlights the importance of utilizing remotely sensed soil moisture and
   vegetation measurements in detecting irrigation signals and correcting
   for vegetation growth. Integrating the two remote sensing datasets into
   the model provides an effective and less feature engineered approach to
   constraining the uncertainty of irrigation modeling. Such strategies can
   be potentially transferred to other modeling systems and applied to
   regions across the globe.},

Abstract = {A capacitive approach is employed to find moisture of the soil at
   various depths (4.5-20 cm). The sensor probe having dimensions 22 x 4 x
   0.5 cm(3), embedded with a series of five microsensors (scalable

   array. The measurement electrodes were designed in an interdigitated
   manner having eight pairs of comblike-shaped fingers with 100 nm
   thickness and 90 mu m spacing. It has been observed that, for black
   soil, all of the microsensors displayed response in the range of
   500-550\% when the soil water content is varied from 3.2 to 55.5\%. The
   graphene oxide-based array probe sensor (GO-APS) shows fast response and
   recovery time of 140 and 20 s, respectively, for 10\% soil moisture
   samples. The soil moisture profile has been monitored up to a scale of
   20 cm depth using the fabricated design. In-depth soil moisture
   profiling shows a maximum deviation of +/- 2.4\% compared with a
   standard oven-drying method. The lump formation effect in soil mass
   showed a maximum deviation of +/- 4\% for the GO-APS array. This robust
   and low-cost GO-APS with high sensitivity is promising for technological

Title = {Evaluation of Remote Sensing and Reanalysis Products for Global Soil
   Moisture Characteristics},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 5},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) exists at the land-atmosphere interface and serves as
   a key driving variable that affects global water balance and vegetation
   growth. Its importance in climate and earth system studies necessitates
   a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of mainstream global remote
   sensing/reanalysis SM products. In this study, we conducted a thorough
   verification of ten global remote sensing/reanalysis SM products: SMAP
   DCA, SMAP SCA-H, SMAP SCA-V, SMAP-IB, SMOS IC, SMOS L3, LPRM\_C1,
   LPRM\_C2, LPRM\_X, and ERA5-Land. The verification was based on ground
   observation data from the International SM Network (ISMN), considering
   both static factors (such as climate zone, land cover type, and soil
   type) and dynamic factors (including SM, leaf area index, and land
   surface temperature). Our goal was to assess the accuracy and
   applicability of these products. We analyzed the spatial and temporal
   distribution characteristics of global SM and discussed the vegetation
   effect on SM products. Additionally, we examined the global
   high-frequency fluctuations in the SMAP L-VOD product, along with their
   correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area
   index, and vegetation water content. Our findings revealed that product
   quality was higher in regions located in tropical and arid zones, closed
   shrubs, loose rocky soil, and gray soil with low soil moisture, low leaf
   area index, and high average land surface temperature. Among the
   evaluated products, SMAP-IB, SMAP DCA, SMAP SCA-H, SMAP SCA-V, and
   ERA5-Land consistently performed better, demonstrating a good ability to
   capture the spatial and temporal variations in SM and showing a
   correlation of approximately 0.60 with ISMN. SMOS IC and SMOS L3
   followed in performance, while LPRM\_C1, LPRM\_C2, and LPRM\_X exhibited
   relatively poor results in SM inversion. These findings serve as a
   valuable reference for improving satellite/reanalysis SM products and
   conducting global-scale SM studies.},

Title = {Assimilation of remote sensing based surface soil moisture to develop a
   spatially varying vertical soil moisture profile database for entire
   Indian mainland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {601},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The Climate Change Initiative (CCI) program of the European Space Agency
   (ESA) (ESA-CCI) provides a global surface Soil Moisture (SM) product by
   merging the information from various Active and Passive sensors on board
   for the period of 1971-2014. This study aims to assimilate this surface
   SM product into a recently developed model, namely Statistical Soil
   Moisture Profile (SSMP) model, to investigate the efficacy of this
   combination in developing a vertical soil moisture profile database over
   a climatologically vast area, such as Indian mainland. The SSMP model is
   a spatially varying statistical framework that couples the memory and
   forcing of SM from the overlying layers and utilizes the information of
   Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that makes it spatially transferable. The
   model estimates SM at four depths i.e. 10, 20, 51 and 102 cm using the
   surface SM information (similar to 0-5 cm). The developed database is
   named as `ESA-CCI Driven Vertical Soil Moisture Profile (root zone)
   Database (EDVSMPD)' and the simulated values are validated with observed
   SM data at many monitoring stations across India, maintained by India
   Meteorological Department (IMD). As an exemplary demonstration of the
   utility of the data, basin scale reconstruction of the historical
   agricultural droughts and its spatial distribution, using the developed
   EDVSMPD product, is illustrated for a medium sized drought-stricken
   river basin, namely Wardha, in the central part of India. The resulting
   SM product for a considerable length of period (more than 30 years) will
   be immensely useful for many hydro-climatological studies.},

Title = {Applicability evaluation of soil moisture constraint algorithms in
   remote sensing evapotranspiration models},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {623},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) models have been widely
   used to estimate ET over large areas. However, a common challenge for
   these models is the lack of reliable soil moisture (SM) constraints. Due
   to the lack of reliable, spatiotemporal continuous SM profile data,
   existing RS-ET models tend to use atmospheric or land surface variables
   as proxies for SM constraints. Although several proxy algorithms for SM
   constraints have been developed, few studies have evaluated their
   performance in ET simulations. To address this gap, we evaluated the
   applicability of five proxy algorithms for SM constraints (namely, fVPD,
   fLST, fDT, fZhang, and fdrying) to ET simulations in China using the
   Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model. These algorithms were evaluated at
   14 ChinaFlux sites and 286 basins using flux tower measurements and
   water balance-based ET estimates, respectively. The results show that
   among the five algorithms, fdrying performs test at the flux sites, with
   a median of Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.75. The second-best
   algorithm is fZhang (KGE = 0.73), followed by fDT (KGE = 0.70), fLST
   (KGE = 0.68), and fVPD (KGE = 0.65). The performance ranking of the five
   algorithms at the basin scale is consistent with that at the flux sites.
   Using the flux site SM measurements as a reference, we further found
   that the algorithms with better performance in ET simulations also have
   better SM simulation capabilities. This study highlights the importance
   of reliable SM constraints in the RS-ET models.},

Abstract = {The complex relationship between precipitation and soil moisture plays a
   critical role in land surface hydrology. Traditionally, the analysis of
   this relationship is restricted by the spatial coverage of both soil
   moisture and precipitation data that are collected through in-situ
   observations at limited locations. In this study, we utilized the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s remote sensing
   products of soil moisture (SMAP: Soil Moisture Active Passive) and
   precipitation (TRMM: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), which provide
   near-global coverage, to investigate the co-variation of precipitation
   and soil moisture regionally, as a function of ecosystem types and
   climate regimes. We apply information on land cover and climate regimes
   to provide insight about correlation strength of soil moisture and
   precipitation. The results indicate that most of the globe has a
   moderate to strong positive correlation of SMAP soil moisture and TRMM
   precipitation data during the study period. In relation to land cover,
   soil moisture and precipitation have the strongest correlations in
   regions of limited vegetation, whereas forests and densely vegetated
   regions have weaker correlations. As for climate regimes, they have the
   strongest correlations in arid or cold regions, and weaker correlations
   in humid, temperate locations. While remotely sensed soil moisture data
   are less reliable in dense vegetation, these results confirm that drier,
   less vegetated climates show a highly linear relationship between soil
   moisture and rainfall.},

Abstract = {Soil samples were taken in order to investigate the spatial soil water
   content changes at 40 points in a field of 675 m(2) located on the old
   Istanbul-Izmit road in Kocaeli-Turkey. The water content values of soil
   samples collected were obtained using oven and Speedy Moisture Tester
   (SMT) in the laboratory to correlate with measured electrical
   conductivity of soil by electrical resistivity method with a 2-electrode
   system. The results showed a reasonably good correlation between
   electrical conductivity and water content. The determination coefficient
   between the water content and the electrical conductivity found by the
   oven method (R-2 approximate to 0.8) was higher than that of the SMT
   (R-2 approximate to 0.6). The correlation between the water content
   values of oven and SMT is quite affordable with the determination
   coefficient (R-2 approximate to 0.7). Considering the results obtained
   from Oven and SMT method, it can be concluded that the resistivity
   method is also successful in measuring soil water content. It is
   foreseen that resistivity method can be preferred both because it is
   easy to use, and large areas are faster and economical in measuring soil
   water content.},

Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In recent years, deep learning algorithms have been successfully applied
   in the development of decision support systems in various aspects of
   agriculture, such as yield estimation, crop diseases, weed detection,
   etc. Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater. Due to
   challenges such as lack of natural resources and climate change, an
   efficient decision support system for irrigation is crucial.
   Evapotranspiration and soil water content are the most critical factors
   in irrigation scheduling. In this paper, the ability of Long Short-Term
   Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) to model daily reference
   evapotranspiration and soil water content is investigated. The
   application of these techniques to predict these parameters was tested
   for three sites in Portugal. A single-layer BLSTM with 512 nodes was
   selected. Bayesian optimization was used to determine the
   hyperparameters, such as learning rate, decay, batch size, and dropout
   size.The model achieved the values of mean square error values within
   the range of 0.014 to 0.056 and R-2 ranging from 0.96 to 0.98. A
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was added to the LSTM to
   investigate potential performance improvement. Performance dropped in
   all datasets due to the complexity of the model. The performance of the
   models was also compared with CNN, traditional machine learning
   algorithms Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest. LSTM achieved
   the best performance. Finally, the impact of the loss function on the
   performance of the proposed models was investigated. The model with the
   mean square error as loss function performed better than the model with
   other loss functions.},

   spectrogram of low-frequency swept acoustic signal},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {441},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Acoustic waves offer a non-destructive, safe, and cost-effective means
   of monitoring the environment, with a potential application in soil
   water content monitoring. However, extracting soil water information
   from acoustic signals is still challenging. To tackle this issue, we
   have developed a low -frequency swept acoustic signal detection device
   and system. We conducted soil penetration testing using low -frequency
   swept acoustic signals. The swept -frequency acoustic signals passing
   through the soil were transformed into time-frequency spectrogram. Using
   the Swin-Transformer model, we established a regression model between
   the time-frequency spectrogram of the swept frequencies and the soil
   water content. Predictions were made both on a laboratory test dataset
   and through field trials using the calibrated model. The results
   indicate that the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values between the observed and the
   model's outputs of water content (\%) for the test laboratory dataset
   are 0.191, 0.081, and 0.999, respectively, using the Swin-Transformer
   model. In the case of the field trials, the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values
   between the predicted and observed values are 6.715 \%, 1.829 \%, and
   0.711, respectively. These studies demonstrate that this method is
   highly effective in predicting soil water content, with the best results
   achieved at a resolution of 20 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) and within the
   frequency range of 260-360 Hz. It provides an efficient approach for
   acoustic soil water content detection, effectively resolves the
   difficulty in building models caused by the single -parameter limitation
   in traditional acoustic model.},

Abstract = {Ground penetrating radar (GPR) has shown a high potential to derive soil
   water content (SWC) at different scales. In this study, we combined
   multiple horizontal GPR measurements at different depths to investigate
   the spatial and temporal variability of the SWC under cropped plots. The
   SWC data were analyzed for four growing seasons between 2014 and 2017,
   two soil types (gravelly and clayeysilty), two crops (wheat {[}Triticum
   aestivum L.] and maize {[}Zea mays L.]), and three different water
   treatments. We acquired more than 150 time-lapse GPR datasets along
   6-m-long horizontal crossholes at six depths. The GPR SWC distributions
   are distinct both horizontally and vertically for both soil types. A
   clear change in SWC can be observed at both sites between the surface
   layer (>0.3 m) and subsoil. Alternating patches of higher and lower SWC,
   probably caused by the soil heterogeneity, were observed along the
   horizontal SWC profiles. To investigate the changes in SWC with time,
   GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data were averaged for each
   depth and compared with changes in precipitation, treatment, and soil
   type. The high-temporal-resolution TDR and the large-sampling-volume GPR
   show similar trends in SWC for both sites, but because of the different
   sensing volumes, different responses were obtained due to the spatial
   heterogeneity. A difference in spatial variation of the crosshole GPR
   SWC data was detected between maize and wheat. The results for this 4-yr
   period indicate the potential of this novel experimental setup to

Abstract = {The article presents an in situ sensor to monitor soil moisture and
   water salinity by measuring soil permittivity and conductivity at a
   frequency 24 MHz via an admittance approach. It addresses difficulties
   encountered in other permittivity-based sensors. A self-balanced bridge
   provides on one measurement a digital output linear to capacitance and
   conductance of electrodes in soil with low offset, high phase
   resolution, and taking into account all parasitic impedances. Circuit
   design and procedures to achieve it are described, using electric
   circuit theory and component specifications. Probe geometry, two
   parallel cylinders, permits insertion in soil from surface, low
   disturbances and a high sample volume around electrodes. It provides an
   analytical relation to convert admittance to soil permittivity.
   Calibration of a sensor with air, alcohols and water fixes its
   sensitivity and residual phase and inductance for an uncertainty lower
   than 2\% over a range up to 80 and 200 mS m(-1). Identical sensors can
   use same parameters after adjusting in one simple operation bridge
   phases. Thermal drift and its consequences on soil variable measurement
   are investigated and physical origins identified. It permits to reduce
   the phase drift within +/- 150 ppm degrees C(- 1 )rad to keep accuracy.},

   Distributed Temperature Sensing Method Used for Soil Moisture Estimation},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Large-scale measurements of soil moisture play a critical role in many
   fields, such as agriculture, hydrology, and engineering. The distributed
   temperature sensing (DTS) technology, based on a dual-probe heat pulse
   (DPHP), is a novel approach to realizing large-scale soil moisture
   estimation. However, the application of the method is limited by the
   complex optical cable layout, calculation algorithm, and lack of
   standardized heating strategy. In this paper, an improved DPHP-DTS
   method considering the soil bulk density was proposed. The measurement
   accuracy of the DPHP-DTS method under different heating strategies was
   studied in laboratory experiments, and its long-term stability in regard
   to the monitoring of soil moisture during natural evaporation in
   different soils was tested. The results show that the improved DPHP-DTS
   method can accurately measure the soil moisture, and the fitting
   algorithm can reduce the error caused by the accuracy of the DTS
   temperature measurement under the low-power heating strategy. Its
   measurement accuracy increases with the increase in the heating strength
   and duration. In addition, the improved DPHP-DTS method can describe
   soil evaporation in both sand and loess with good reliability and
   stability.},

Title = {Fine-Resolution Measurement of Soil Moisture From Cumulative InSAR
   Closure Phase},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Abstract = {Soil moisture can vary spatially at the scale of agricultural fields
   (similar to 10-100 m), which is generally too fine to resolve using
   passive radiometric methods. Active radar provides an opportunity for
   finer resolution measurements; in particular, the interferometric
   synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) closure phase parameter is sensitive to
   changing soil moisture. We have developed a model showing that a
   systematic nonzero closure phase can result from scattering from objects
   at different depths in a medium of time-varying dielectric, such as from
   changes in soil moisture. The model predicts that interference between
   surface and subsurface reflections is needed for the closure phase to be
   nonzero. We find that, under certain circumstances, we can estimate soil
   moisture from the closure phase using a data reduction approach that
   includes a cumulative sum of the closure phase over time and the removal
   of a trend. The correlation between the cumulative closure phase and
   soil moisture suggests that the closure phase is related to the change
   in soil moisture. We examine a large test region in Oklahoma, where the
   detrended cumulative closure phase from Sentinel-1 data demonstrates
   some agreement with in situ soil moisture measurements. In other areas,
   the match is weaker, implying a terrain dependence on the quality of
   fit. The cumulative InSAR closure phase promises to provide a valuable
   new method to remotely estimate soil moisture.},

Title = {DeepQC: A deep learning system for automatic quality control of in-situ
   soil moisture sensor time series data},
Journal = {SMART AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Amidst changing climate, real-time soil moisture monitoring is vital for
   the development of in-season decision support tools to help farmers
   manage weather-related risks in agriculture. Precision Sustainable
   Agriculture (PSA) recently established a real-time soil moisture
   monitoring network across the central, Midwest, and eastern U.S., but
   continuous field-scale sensor observations often come with data gaps and
   anomalies. To maintain the data quality and continuity needed for
   developing decision tools, a quality control system is necessary. The
   International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) introduced the Flagit module
   for anomaly detection in soil moisture time series observations.
   However, under certain conditions, Flagit's threshold and spectral based
   quality control approaches may underperform in identifying anomalies.
   Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to detect
   time series anomalies in time series data in various disciplines.
   However, their use in agriculture for anomaly detection in time series
   datasets has not been yet investigated. This study focuses on developing
   a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, referred to as
   DeepQC, to identify anomalies in soil moisture time series data. Manual
   flagged PSA observations were used for training, validation, and testing
   the model, following an 80:10:10 split. The study then compared the
   DeepQC and Flagit-based estimates to assess their relative performance.
   Flagit correctly flagged 95.8 \% of the correct observations and 50.3 \%
   of the anomaly observations, indicating its limitations in identifying
   anomalies, particularly at sites consists of more than 30 \% anomalies.
   On the other hand, the DeepQC correctly flagged 89.8 \% of the correct
   observations and 99.5 \% of the anomalies, with overall accuracy of 95.6
   \%, in significantly less time, demonstrating its superiority over
   Flagit approach. Importantly, the performance of the DeepQC remained
   consistent regardless of the number of anomalies in site observations.
   Given the promising results obtained with the DeepQC, future studies
   will focus on implementing and finetuning this model on national and
   global soil moisture networks.},

   3.0 Generates Higher Accuracy Blended Satellite Soil Moisture},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a vital role for the understanding of hydrological,
   meteorological, and climatological land surface processes. To meet the
   need of real time global soil moisture datasets, a Soil Moisture
   Operational Product System (SMOPS) has been developed at National
   Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to produce a one-stop shop for
   soil moisture observations from all available satellite sensors. What
   makes the SMOPS unique is its near real time global blended soil
   moisture product. Since the first version SMOPS publicly released in
   2010, the SMOPS has been updated twice based on the users' feedbacks
   through improving retrieval algorithms and including observations from
   new satellite sensors. The version 3.0 SMOPS has been operationally
   released since 2017. Significant differences in climatological averages
   lead to remarkable distinctions in data quality between the newest and
   the older versions of SMOPS blended soil moisture products. This study
   reveals that the SMOPS version 3.0 has overwhelming advantages of
   reduced data uncertainties and increased correlations with respect to
   the quality controlled in situ measurements. The new version SMOPS also
   presents more robust agreements with the European Space Agency's Climate
   Change Initiative (ESA\_CCI) soil moisture datasets. With the higher
   accuracy, the blended data product from the new version SMOPS is
   expected to benefit the hydrological, meteorological, and climatological
   researches, as well as numerical weather, climate, and water prediction

Title = {Proximal sensor data fusion for tropical soil property prediction: Soil
   fertility properties},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SOUTH AMERICAN EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {116},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Proximal sensors have proven capable of predicting multiple soil
   properties under different conditions. However, doubts remain about
   which sensor is preferable for delivering optimal prediction models and
   which preprocessing methods produce the most accurate results. Portable
   X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry and visible near-infrared
   (Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have been widely used, while
   the NixProTM color sensor has been explored more recently. This study
   evaluated the use of pXRF, Vis-NIR, and NixProTM data to predict soil
   organic matter content (SOM), pH, base saturation (BS), the sum of bases
   (SB), cation exchange capacity (CEC) at pH = 7 and effective CEC (eCEC),
   via each sensor in isolation, and via combined sensors data. Moreover,
   factors interfering in the prediction models' accuracy (data
   preprocessing methods, soil horizon, soil class, parent material) were
   used as auxiliary variables. 604 soil samples were collected in Brazil,
   encompassing ten soil orders and 19 parent materials. Numerical and
   categorical prediction models (7,980) were created for six soil
   properties using a random forest algorithm, totaling 7980 models,
   delivering almost 24,000 results., Coefficient of determination (R2),
   root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and residual
   prediction deviation (RPD) were used for validation of numerical
   predictions., Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were calcualted for
   categorical predictions. Although the combination of sensors provided
   most of the best predictions, pXRF in isolation achieved accuracies
   close to the three sensors combined. NixProTM offered superior
   contributions to SOM and CEC predictions, but pXRF and Vis-NIR were
   responsible for the best results of most studied variables. On average,
   by adding pXRF to Vis-NIR data, predictive accuracy improved 32\%; while
   adding Vis-NIR to pXRF data increased accuracy by ca. 6\%.
   Soil-order-specific models improved predictions for Ultisols compared to
   general models (without soil order distinction), reaching R2 > 0.90.
   Soil parent material and horizon did not improve models significantly.
   Categorical predictions improved the accuracy for some properties,
   reaching an overall accuracy of 100\% and kappa index of 1.0 for pH in A
   horizons of Ultisols via pXRF + Vis-NIR data. Proximal sensor data with
   no auxiliary variables provided almost all the best results. The fusion
   of proximal sensors can provide better predictions, but pXRF alone can
   deliver satisfactory results in most cases for the six soil properties.},

Title = {Soil Moisture Estimation for Winter-Wheat Waterlogging Monitoring by
   Assimilating Remote Sensing Inversion Data into the Distributed
   Hydrology Soil Vegetation Model},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Waterlogging crop disasters are caused by continuous and excessive soil
   water in the upper layer of soil. In order to enable waterlogging
   monitoring, it is important to collect continuous and accurate soil
   moisture data. The distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (DHSVM)
   is selected as the basic hydrological model for soil moisture estimation
   and winter-wheat waterlogging monitoring. To handle the error
   accumulation of the DHSVM and the poor continuity of remote sensing (RS)
   inversion data, an agro-hydrological model that assimilates RS inversion
   data into the DHSVM is used for winter-wheat waterlogging monitoring.
   The soil moisture content maps retrieved from satellite images are
   assimilated into the DHSVM by the successive correction method.
   Moreover, in order to reduce the modeling error accumulation, monthly
   and real-time RS inversion maps that truly reflect local soil moisture
   distributions are regularly assimilated into the agro-hydrological
   modeling process each month. The results show that the root mean square
   errors (RMSEs) of the simulated soil moisture value at two in situ
   experiment points were 0.02077 and 0.02383, respectively, which were
   9.96\% and 12.02\% of the measured value. From the accurate and
   continuous soil moisture results based on the agro-hydrological
   assimilation model, the waterlogging-damaged ratio and grade
   distribution information for winter-wheat waterlogging were extracted.
   The results indicate that there were almost no high-damaged-ratio and
   severe waterlogging damage areas in Lixin County, which was consistent
   with the local field investigation.},

Abstract = {The existing soil moisture sensing mechanism of the heat pulse probe
   (HPP) assumes the ideal condition of the soil while overlooking the
   physics of the device and the composition of the soil and its
   properties. In the present study, we propose modifications to the soil
   moisture sensing model of HPP by considering its physical parameters and
   their appropriate association with the thermal properties of soil and
   its mineral composition. Primarily, a novel model for the heat strength
   of the probe of HPP is proposed and examined. It results in R-2 =
   0.9809, adjusted R-2 = 0.9721, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.73
   W/m for experimentally measured values versus obtained values of heat
   strength using the proposed model. Subsequently, a soil
   composition-based model is developed resulting in a 19\%-25\% change in
   the bulk volumetric heat capacity of the soil. A final model of soil
   moisture estimation is developed by combining the heat strength of the
   probe of HPP, and the bulk volumetric heat capacity and porosity of the
   soil. The proposed model suggests improved results in soil moisture
   measurement in the range of -0.004 to 0.306 m(3)/m(3) which can be
   useful for different applications and several types of soil. Moreover,
   the model-predicted values of soil moisture are validated with
   experimental values in previous studies and linked with futuristic
   applications. R-2 = 0.9763, adjusted R-2 = 0.9527, and RMSE of 0.032
   m(3)/m(3) are obtained for soil moisture measured experimentally versus

Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Efficient long-term management for the production of high-quality
   Cymbidium plants is required as these orchids generally require 3-4
   years of vegetative growth to allow flowering. This study was conducted
   to investigate the optimal substrate moisture levels to efficiently
   produce young cymbidium using a soil moisture sensor-based automated
   irrigation system over 42 weeks of vegetative growth. One-year-old
   cymbidium ``Hoshino Shizuku{''} plantlets were grown in coir dust
   substrate at four levels of volumetric water content (0.25, 0.35, 0.45,
   and 0.55 m(3)center dot m(-3)). At harvest, the numbers of leaves and
   pseudobulbs, and the chlorophyll content of the cymbidiums did not
   differ among the four theta threshold treatments. However, plants grown
   at 0.25 m(3)center dot m(-3) had significantly smaller leaves,
   pseudobulbs, and biomass than those at the other theta threshold
   treatments. Although the lower theta decreased the photosynthetic
   parameters, such as the net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and
   transpiration, there were no differences in the maximum quantum yield of
   photosystem II, indicating that the reduction in net photosynthesis is
   mostly mediated by stomatal closure. Although the net photosynthesis at
   theta of 0.35 m(3)center dot m(-3) was also lower than that at 0.55
   m(3)center dot m(-3) treatment, biomass was significantly lower only at
   0.25 m(3)center dot m(-3) treatment, suggesting that a critical growth
   reduction by the water deficit occurred for the cymbidium at 0.25
   m(3)center dot m(-3). As the theta threshold increased, the total
   irrigation amount significantly increased, which inversely decreased the
   water use efficiency. Although the plants grown at 0.25 m(3)center dot
   m(-3) had the highest water use efficiency (WUE) and substrate
   electrical conductivity they showed significantly reduced growth
   compared to other theta threshold treatments, and thus this was not a
   reliable theta threshold level for producing high (visual) quality
   cymbidium. Overall, the 0.35 and 0.45 m(3)center dot m(-3) threshold
   treatments provided appropriate moisture levels for high-quality
   cymbidium production with high water use efficiency.},

Abstract = {The assimilation of radiometer and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data
   is a promising recent technique to downscale soil moisture products, yet
   it requires land surface parameters and meteorological forcing data at a
   high spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a new downscaling
   approach, named integrated passive and active downscaling (I-PAD), to
   achieve high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture datasets over
   regions without detailed soil data. The Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Phased Array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data are
   combined through a dual-pass land data assimilation system to obtain
   soil moisture at 1 km resolution. In the first step, fine resolution
   model parameters are optimized based on fine resolution PALSAR soil
   moisture and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf
   area index data, and coarse resolution AMSR-E brightness temperature
   data. Then, the 25 km AMSR-E observations are assimilated into a land
   surface model at 1 km resolution with a simple but computationally
   low-cost algorithm that considers the spatial resolution difference.
   Precipitation data are used as the only inputs from ground measurements.
   The evaluations at the two lightly vegetated sites in Mongolia and the
   Little Washita basin show that the time series of soil moisture are
   improved at most of the observation by the assimilation scheme. The
   analyses reveal that I-PAD can capture overall spatial trends of soil
   moisture within the coarse resolution radiometer footprints,
   demonstrating the potential of the algorithm to be applied over
   data-sparse regions. The capability and limitation are discussed based
   on the simple optimization and assimilation schemes used in the
   algorithm.},

   sensors. Active, passive, and optic data integration could be a
   comprehensive solution for exploiting the advantages of different
   sensors aimed at preparing soil moisture maps. Typically, pixel-based
   methods are used for multi-sensor fusion. Since, different applications
   need different scales of soil moisture maps, pixel-based approaches are
   limited for this purpose. Object-based image analysis employing an image
   object instead of a pixel could help us to meet this need. This paper
   proposes a segment-based image fusion framework to evaluate the
   possibility of preparing a multi-scale soil moisture map through
   integrated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Soil Moisture Active Passive
   (SMAP) data. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology was
   able to improve soil moisture estimation in different scales up to 20\%
   better compared to pixel-based fusion approach.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for non-invasive soil moisture
   estimations at the field scale. The derivation of soil moisture
   generally relies on secondary cosmic-ray neutrons in the epithermal to
   fast energy ranges. Most approaches and processing techniques for
   observed neutron intensities are based on the assumption of homogeneous
   site conditions or of soil moisture patterns with correlation lengths
   shorter than the measurement footprint of the neutron detector. However,
   in view of the non-linear relationship between neutron intensities and
   soil moisture, it is questionable whether these assumptions are
   applicable. In this study, we investigated how a non-uniform soil
   moisture distribution within the footprint impacts the CRNS soil
   moisture estimation and how the combined use of epithermal and thermal
   neutrons can be advantageous in this case. Thermal neutrons have lower
   energies and a substantially smaller measurement footprint around the
   sensor than epithermal neutrons. Analyses using the URANOS (Ultra RApid
   Neutron-Only Simulation) Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the
   measurement footprint dynamics at a study site in northeastern Germany
   revealed that the thermal footprint mainly covers mineral soils in the
   near-field to the sensor while the epithermal footprint also covers
   large areas with organic soils. We found that either combining the
   observed thermal and epithermal neutron intensities by a rescaling
   method developed in this study or adjusting all parameters of the
   transfer function leads to an improved calibration against the reference
   soil moisture measurements in the near-field compared to the standard
   approach and using epithermal neutrons alone. We also found that the
   relationship between thermal and epithermal neutrons provided an
   indicator for footprint heterogeneity. We, therefore, suggest that the
   combined use of thermal and epithermal neutrons offers the potential of
   a spatial disaggregation of the measurement footprint in terms of near-
   and far-field soil moisture dynamics.},

   under various substrate conditions},
Journal = {SCIENTIA HORTICULTURAE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {286},
Month = {AUG 25},
Abstract = {Most orchid growers use bark as substrate to avoid too wet conditions,
   although it requires excessive water use of leaching. We conducted
   research to investigate the applicability of a soil moisture
   sensor-based automated irrigation system in Cymbidium production for
   efficient irrigation management and compared the growth and water use of
   Cymbidium under various substrate conditions. One-year-old Cymbidium
   `Hoshino Shizuku' plantlets were grown in bark, coconut husk chips, coir
   dust, or a commercial growing mix at a similar matric potential within
   the easily available water range. Irrigation occurred when the substrate
   dried below the volumetric water content thresholds at 0.25, 0.30, 0.35,
   and 0.40 m(3) m(-3) in the bark, coconut husk chips, coir dust, and the
   commercial growing mix, respectively. Pseudobulb size, net
   photosynthetic assimilation rate, fresh shoot, and root weight of the
   Cymbidium showed no differences among the substrates, although Cymbidium
   grown in the commercial growing mix had better shoot growth than plants
   in the other substrates. The amount of irrigation was higher (ca. 6
   times) in coarse substrates (bark and coconut husk chips) than fine
   substrates (coir dust and the commercial growing mix), indicating that
   fine substrates with higher water-holding capacity could use water more
   efficiently. The amount of irrigation and nutrient availability of the
   substrate in the coarse substrates were much lower than those in the
   fine substrates, producing a difference in growth of the Cymbidium among
   the substrates. Water use efficiency was 8-9.5 times higher in Cymbidium
   grown in fine substrates than plants grown in coarse substrates.
   Overall, the soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system
   could provide an appropriate moisture level for Cymbidium grown in fine
   substrates, avoiding too wet conditions, and produced quality Cymbidium
   with more efficient water and nutrient use than orchids produced in
   coarse substrates.},

Title = {Reconciling Flagging Strategies for Multi-Sensor Satellite Soil Moisture
   Climate Data Records},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Reliable soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave satellite
   sensors are limited during certain conditions, e.g., snow coverage,
   radio-frequency interference, and dense vegetation. In these cases, the
   retrievals can be masked using flagging algorithms. Currently available
   single- and multi-sensor soil moisture products utilize different
   flagging approaches. However, a clear overview and comparison of these
   approaches and their impact on soil moisture data are still lacking. For
   long-term climate records such as the soil moisture products of the
   European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the effect
   of any flagging inconsistency resulting from combining multiple sensor
   datasets is not yet understood. Therefore, the first objective of this
   study is to review the data flagging system that is used within
   multi-sensor ESA CCI soil moisture products as well as the flagging
   systems of two other soil moisture datasets from sensors that are also
   used for the ESA CCI soil moisture products: The level 3 Soil Moisture
   and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP).
   The SMOS and SMAP soil moisture flagging systems differ substantially in
   number and type of conditions considered, critical flags, and data
   source dependencies. The impact on the data availability of the
   different flagging systems were compared for the SMOS and SMAP soil
   moisture datasets. Major differences in data availability were observed
   globally, especially for northern high latitudes, mountainous regions,
   and equatorial latitudes (up to 37\%, 33\%, and 32\% respectively) with
   large seasonal variability. These results highlight the importance of a
   consistent and well-performing approach that is applicable to all
   individual products used in long-term soil moisture data records.
   Consequently, the second objective of the present study is to design a
   consistent and model-independent flagging strategy to improve soil
   moisture climate records such as the ESA CCI products. As snow cover,
   ice, and frozen conditions were demonstrated to have the biggest impact
   on data availability, a uniform satellite driven flagging strategy was
   designed for these conditions and evaluated against two ground
   observation networks. The new flagging strategy demonstrated to be a
   robust flagging alternative when compared to the individual flagging
   strategies adopted by the SMOS and SMAP soil moisture datasets with a
   similar performance, but with the applicability to the entire ESA CCI
   time record without the use of modelled approximations.},

Title = {Mini Inside-Out Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Sensor Design for Soil
   Moisture Measurements},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The improvement of water management in agriculture by exactly detecting
   moisture parameters of soil is crucial. To investigate this problem, a
   mini inside-out nuclear magnetic resonance sensor (NMR) was proposed to
   measure moisture parameters of model soils. This sensor combines three
   cylindrical magnets that are magnetized in the axial direction and three
   arc spiral coils of the same size in series. We calculated and optimized
   the magnet structure by equivalent magnetization to current density. By
   adjusting the radius and height between the cylinders, a circumferential
   symmetric constant gradient field (2.28 T/m) was obtained. The NMR
   sensor was set at 2.424 MHz to measure the water content of sandy soil
   with small particle diameter and silica sand with large particle
   diameter. The complete decaying, an NMR signal was analyzed through
   inverse Laplace transformation and averaged on a T-2 space. According to
   the results, moisture content of the sample is positively correlated
   with the integral area of T-2 spectrum peak (A(peak)); T-2 of the water
   in small pores is shorter than that in large pores, because the movement
   of water molecules are limited by the inner wall of the pores. In the
   same volume, water in large pore sample is more than that in small pore
   sample, so A(peak) of silica sand is larger than A(peak) of sandy soil.
   Therefore, the sensor is capable of detecting moisture both content and
   pore size of the sample. This mini sensor (4.0 cm in diameter and 10 cm
   in length) is portable, and the lowest measurable humidity is 0.38\%.
   Thus, this sensor will allow easy soil moisture measurements on-field in
   the future.},

Title = {Electronic sensing combined with machine learning models for predicting
   soil nutrient content},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {221},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Traditional methods for detecting soil nutrient content usually involve
   laborious and time-consuming experimental procedures, hindering the
   efficiency of soil analysis and making them less suitable for
   large-scale soil testing. Therefore, there exists a pressing need to
   develop innovative solutions. This study aimed to investigate the
   potential relationship between soil pyrolysis gas and soil nutrient
   content by establishing a model that combined electronic sensing and
   machine learning to predict soil nutrient content. The initial data sets
   were derived from utilizing pyrolysis gas response curves of soil
   samples acquired from 10 distinct gas sensors. Afterward, we
   innovatively proposed a sensor array optimization (SAO) method based on
   the dynamic feature importance (DFI) of the Random Forest-Pearson
   Correlation Coefficient (RF-PCC) to identify the optimal sensor
   combinations for four soil nutrients. Furthermore, Support Vector
   Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and
   Multilayer Perceptron-Random Forest (MLP-RF) models were employed to
   predict the soil nutrient content based on the electronic sense to
   address the challenges associated with developing a unified model. The
   MLP-RF models showed superior performance compared with the other three
   models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) for the four soil
   nutrients ranging from 0.54 to 0.94. Overall, our research not only
   provides approximately quantitative predictive outcomes but also
   contributes to a better understanding of a new approach for detecting
   soil nutrient content.},

Abstract = {Soil water content and matric potential are central hydrological state
   variables. A large variety of automated probes and sensor systems for
   state monitoring exist and are frequently applied. Most applications
   solely rely on the calibration by the manufacturers. Until now, there
   has been no commonly agreed-upon calibration procedure. Moreover,
   several opinions about the capabilities and reliabilities of specific
   sensing methods or sensor systems exist and compete.
   A consortium of several institutions conducted a comparison study of
   currently available sensor systems for soil water content and matric
   potential under field conditions. All probes were installed at 0.2 m
   b.s. (metres below surface), following best-practice procedures. We
   present the set-up and the recorded data of 58 probes of 15 different
   systems measuring soil moisture and 50 further probes of 14 different
   systems for matric potential. We briefly discuss the limited coherence
   of the measurements in a cross-correlation analysis.
   The measuring campaign was conducted during the growing period of 2016.
   The monitoring data, results from pedophysical analyses of the soil and

   for Accurate Estimation of Evapotranspiration Through a Data-driven
   Method},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {331},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {A soil moisture data-driven method through inversely solving the
   Richards' equation was tested, and proved to be a reliable alternative
   estimator of actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for relatively homogeneous
   soils in an arid region. Few studies have examined the feasibility of
   the method using soil moisture for soils with more heterogeneities,
   which may lead to biased parameters and varied root depths, and thus
   inaccurate estimates of ETa. We used a genetic algorithm to optimize the
   parameters most sensitive to ETa estimation, then estimated daily and
   seasonal ETa using hourly soil moisture data, measured from four sites
   (from surface to 2-m depth at 20-cm intervals) with different soil
   textures and crop species in desert-oasis farmlands in northwest China.
   The seasonal ETa values were 487, 574, 436, and 377 mm at the sites
   cropped with field maize, spring wheat, seed maize, and seed maize,
   respectively, in 2018. The daily rates from one site were validated
   against the eddy-covariance measurements, and the daily rates from all
   the sites were compared against the estimations from a simple water
   balance method, and both showed good consistency (R2 = 0.72-0.93). The
   inverse method has great potential for relatively accurate estimates of
   ETa in the middle and late growing stages but may induce a slight
   underestimation in the initial growing season. To determine the minimum
   monitoring depths of sensors for relatively accurate estimates, ETa
   values were estimated using soil moisture data at various observation
   depths, and were compared with eddy-covariance measurements and
   hypothetical ETa-observed depth curves. The results showed that
   inaccurate stratification of soil types in the profiles may cause great
   uncertainty in the estimates, and if texture-contrasting interlayers
   exist in the profiles, the lowest soil moisture sensor should be placed
   sufficiently deep, with all the interlayers fully included.},

Abstract = {The existing point-scale or large-scale soil moisture content (SMC)
   monitoring techniques cannot entirely satisfy the requirements of in
   situ SMC monitoring for agricultural purposes. We proposed a framework
   for in situ mesoscale SMC monitoring based on global navigation
   satellite system interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) and ensemble
   modeling technique. The framework consists of a data collecting and
   preparing system and an SMC retrieval system. The amplitude, phase, and
   detection depth, which are the GNSS-IR signal-to-noise ratio parameters,
   were positively and negatively correlated with the volumetric SMC data,
   respectively. In the SMC retrieval stage, five kinds of models including
   linear regression, multi-linear regression, k-neighbor regressor,
   support vector regressor, and random forest (RF) was tested as the
   first-order model. Two kinds of swarm optimization algorithms including
   sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   were examined for models' hyper-parameter optimization. The results show
   that the RF performed best and had a coefficient of determination (R-2)
   of 0.798, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.043 cm(3)/cm(3), and a
   mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3) for the validation set.
   Both the SSA and PSO are effective for models' optimization. After input
   variable selection, the second-order ensemble RF model outperformed the
   first-order RF model and had an R-2 of 0.819, an RMSE of 0.040
   cm(3)/cm(3), and an MAE of 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3) for the validation set. The
   proposed framework is potentially valuable for popularization because of
   its cost-effectiveness and high accuracy. (c) 2022 Society of

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Owing to the increasing popularity of smart agriculture in recent years,
   it is necessary to develop a single sensor that can measure several soil
   properties, particularly the soil water content and matric potential.
   Therefore, in this study, we developed a sensor that can simultaneously
   measure soil water content (theta), electrical conductivity (sigma(b)),
   temperature, and matric potential (psi). The proposed sensor can
   determine theta and sigma(b) using time domain transmissiometry and can
   determine psi based on the capacitance of the accompanying ceramic
   plate. A series of laboratory and field tests were conducted to evaluate
   the performance of the sensor. The sensor output values were correlated
   with the soil properties, and the temperature dependence of the sensor
   outputs was evaluated. Additionally, field tests were conducted to
   measure transient soil conditions over a long period. The results show
   that the developed sensor can measure each soil property with acceptable
   accuracy. Moreover, the root-mean-square errors of the sensor and
   reference values were 1.7 for the dielectric constant (which is
   equivalent to theta), 62 mS m(-1) for sigma(b), and 0.05-0.88 for log
   psi. The temperature dependence was not a problem, except when psi was
   below -100 kPa. The sensor can be used for long-term measurements in
   agricultural fields and exhibited sufficient lifetime and performance.
   We believe that the developed sensor can contribute to smart agriculture
   and research on heat and mass transfer in soil.},

Abstract = {Large-scale measurements of the spatial distribution of water content in
   soils and snow are challenging for state-of-the-art hydrogeophysical
   methods. Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a noninvasive technology
   that has the potential to bridge the scale gap between conventional in
   situ sensors and remote sensing products in both, horizontal and
   vertical domains. In this study, we explore the feasibility and
   potential of estimating water content in soils and snow with neutron
   detectors in moving trains. Theoretical considerations quantify the
   stochastic measurement uncertainty as a function of water content,
   altitude, resolution, and detector efficiency. Numerical experiments
   demonstrate that the sensitivity of measured water content is almost
   unperturbed by train materials. Finally, three distinct real-world
   experiments provide a proof of concept on short and long-range tracks.
   With our results a transregional observational soil moisture product
   becomes a realistic vision within the next years.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) and evapotranspiration (ET) are key variables of the
   terrestrial water cycle with a strong relationship. This study examines
   remotely sensed soil moisture and evapotranspiration data assimilation
   (DA) with the aim of improving drought monitoring. Although numerous
   efforts have gone into assimilating satellite soil moisture observations
   into land surface models to improve their predictive skills, little
   attention has been given to the combined use of soil moisture and
   evapotranspiration to better characterize hydrologic fluxes. In this
   study, we assimilate two remotely sensed datasets, namely, Soil Moisture
   Operational Product System (SMOPS) and MODIS evapotranspiration (MODIS16
   ET), at 1-km spatial resolution, into the VIC land surface model by
   means of an evolutionary particle filter method. To achieve this, a
   fully parallelized framework based on model and domain decomposition
   using a parallel divide-and-conquer algorithm was implemented. The
   findings show improvement in soil moisture predictions by multivariate
   assimilation of both ET and SM as compared to univariate scenarios. In
   addition, monthly and weekly drought maps are produced using the updated
   root-zone soil moisture percentiles over the
   Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint basin in the southeastern United
   States. The model-based estimates are then compared against the
   corresponding U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) archive maps. The results are
   consistent with the USDM maps during the winter and spring season
   considering the drought extents; however, the drought severity was found
   to be slightly higher according to DA method. Comparing different
   assimilation scenarios showed that ET assimilation results in wetter
   conditions comparing to open-loop and univariate SM DA. The multivariate
   DA then combines the effects of the two variables and provides an
   in-between condition.},

Title = {A Vegetation-Temperature-Radiation-Composite Method for Downscaling Soil
   Moisture},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Abstract = {To address limitations in regional-scale applications of passive
   microwave remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products, various
   downscaling methods have been proposed to enhance the spatial resolution
   of SM. Nonetheless, these downscaled methods, which are based on optical
   and thermal infrared data, face challenges in vegetated areas and are
   prone to inaccuracies due to cloud cover affecting ancillary data. In
   response to these challenges, we introduced a novel approach termed the
   vegetation-temperature-radiation-composite (VTRC) method. This method
   recognizes the robust interaction between vegetation and SM and also
   appreciates the high sensitivity of surface temperature variation to
   surface net solar radiation (SSR) in relation to SM. Besides, the VTRC
   method combines ERA5 data with its high temporal resolution and MODIS
   data to counteract data loss due to cloud coverage. Applied to downscale
   the ESA CCI SM products from 0.25 degrees to 0.01 degrees spatial
   resolution, the VTRC method is validated over Castilla y Leon (Spain)
   and Anhui province (China). The VTRC method demonstrates a significant
   improvement compared to the feature space-based downscaled method and
   the original ESA CCI products, achieving higher correlation coefficient
   ( \$R\$ ) of 0.56 and 0.66
   \$\textbackslash{}text\{m\}<\^{}>\{3\}/\textbackslash{}text\{m\}<\^{}>\{
   3\}\$ in humid and semi-arid regions with ground observations,
   respectively. Furthermore, it maintains a consistent unbiased root mean
   square error (ub RMSE) of 0.05
   \$\textbackslash{}text\{m\}<\^{}>\{3\}/\textbackslash{}text\{m\}<\^{}>\{
   3\}\$ in both regions. Additionally, the inclusion of vegetation
   information notably improves the accuracy in comparison to solely using
   land surface temperature (LST) and SSR. Significantly, evaluations
   across varying vegetation cover surfaces revealed enhanced accuracy,
   especially in regions with abundant vegetation.},

Abstract = {The instrumental monitoring of torrential catchments is a fundamental
   research task that provides necessary information to improve our
   understanding of the mechanisms of debris flows. While most monitoring
   sites include meteorological sensors and analyze the critical rainfall
   conditions, very few contain soil moisture measurements. In our
   monitoring site, the Rebaixader catchment, 11 debris flows and 24 debris
   floods were detected during the last 9 years. Herein, the initiation
   mechanisms of these torrential flows were analyzed, focusing on the
   critical rainfall conditions and the soil water dynamics. Comparing the
   temporal distribution of both rainfall episodes and torrential flows,
   the Kernel density plots showed maximum values for rainfalls at the
   beginning of June, while the peak for torrential flows is on July 20.
   Thus, the antecedent rainfall, and especially the soil moisture
   conditions, may influence the triggering of torrential flows. In a
   second step, a new updated rainfall threshold was proposed that included
   total rainfall duration and mean intensity. The analysis of soil
   moisture data was more complicated, and no clear trends were observed in
   the data set. Therefore, additional data have to be recorded in order to
   quantitatively analyze the role of soil moisture on the triggering of
   torrential flows and for the definition of thresholds. Some preliminary
   results show that the soil moisture at the beginning of a rainfall event
   affects the maximum increase of soil moisture, while a slight trend was
   visible comparing the initial soil moisture with the necessary rainfall
   amount to trigger a torrential flow.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is a basic condition for crop growth, and a
   key parameter for crop yield prediction and drought monitoring. An
   advantage of large-scale synchronous observation using remote sensing
   technology is that it provides the possibility of dynamic monitoring of
   soil moisture content in a large area. This study aimed to explore the
   feasibility of accurately estimating soil moisture content at a regional
   scale by combining ground hyper-spectral data with multispectral remote
   sensing (Sentinel-2) data. The results showed that the different
   mathematical transformations increased the correlation between soil
   spectral reflectance and SMC to varying degrees. Hyper-spectral
   optimized index normalized difference index (NDI) ((B-769 similar to 797
   - B-848 similar to 881/B-769 similar to 797 + B-848 similar to 881);

   significant correlation (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.61; r = 0.47)
   with SMC, and the correlation coefficient values higher than difference

   models which were taken optimized indices as independent variables, the

   When verifying the accuracy, the model yields R-2 values of 0.619 and
   0.701. These results indicated that the two-band hyper-spectral

Title = {Mandarin irrigation scheduling by means of frequency domain
   reflectometry soil moisture monitoring},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {235},
Month = {MAY 31},
Abstract = {The accurate estimation of plant water needs is the first step for
   achieving high crop water productivity. The main objective of the work
   was to develop an irrigation scheduling procedure for mandarin orchards
   under Mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed
   water using reference values of soil moisture according to different
   phenological periods. The proposed methodology includes a definition
   part where the threshold values were established relating the trees'
   stem water potential and the volumetric soil water content measured with
   Frequency Domain Reflectometry probes. A second part includes the steps
   for standardizing measurements from capacitance probes by using the
   LEACHM hydrological simulation model to take into account the
   sensor-to-sensor variations. Finally, an extrapolation procedure based
   on soil water retention curves was used for adapting critical soil water
   content thresholds to different soil conditions. Field evaluations were
   made in a citrus orchard located in eastern Spain during two seasons.
   Standardize critical soil water contents were: i) 24 \% vol. for
   post-harvest, bloom - fruit set and phase III of fruit growth; ii) 27 \%
   vol. for phase I of fruit growth, and iii) 29 \% vol. for phase II of
   fruit growth with average daily air vapour pressure deficit values
   ranging between 0.2 - 0.4; 0.9-1.1 and 1.1-1.3 kPa, respectively. When
   implemented in the orchard, the sensor-based strategy resulted in water
   saving of 26 \% respect to a control treatment, irrigated using the
   standard FAO-56 approach, without significant differences in yield and
   increasing the crop water productivity by 33 \%. In conclusion, we
   suggest that the determination and use of the critical soil water
   content is a useful tool for scheduling irrigation. The proposed
   standardization and extrapolation methodology allows the irrigation
   strategy to be applied to other mandarin orchards under similar climatic
   conditions.},

   Tomography under Homogeneous Field Conditions},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {There is a gap between lab experiments where resistivity-soil moisture
   relations are generally very good and field studies in complex
   environmental settings where relations are always less good and
   complicated by many factors. An experiment was designed where
   environmental settings are more controlled, the best outside laboratory,
   to assess the transferability from lab to outdoor. A field experiment
   was carried out to evaluate the use of electric resistivity tomography
   (ERT) for monitoring soil moisture dynamics over a period of 67 days. A
   homogeneous site in the central part of The Netherlands was selected
   consisting of grass pasture on an aeolian sand soil profile. ERT values
   were correlated to gravimetric soil moisture samples for five depths at
   three different dates. Correlations ranged from 0.43 to 0.73 and were
   best for a soil depth of 90 cm. Resistivity patterns over time
   (time-lapse ERT) were analyzed and related to rainfall events where
   rainfall infiltration patterns could be identified. Duplicate ERT
   measurements showed that the noise level of the instrument and
   measurements is low and generally below 3\% for the soil profile below
   the mixed layer but above the groundwater. Although the majority of the
   measured resistivity patterns could be well explained, some artefacts
   and dynamics were more difficult to clarify, even so in this homogeneous
   field situation. The presence of an oak tree with its root structure and
   a ditch with surface water with higher conductivity may have an impact
   on the resistivity pattern in the soil profile and over time. We
   conclude that ERT allows for detailed spatial measurement of local soil
   moisture dynamics resulting from precipitation although field
   experiments do not yield accuracies similar to laboratory experiments.
   ERT approaches are suitable for detailed spatial analyses where probe or
   sample-based methods are limited in reach or repeatability.},

Title = {Downscaling Passive Microwave Soil Moisture Estimates Using Stand-Alone
   Optical Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Abstract = {Downscaling of passive microwave derived soil moisture (SM) using
   thermal-infrared remote sensing data is a common method to obtain higher
   resolution SM information. However, these thermal-based downscaling
   methods are limited by their requirement of daily reparameterization
   because thermal-infrared data are influenced by both the SM content and
   weather conditions. To overcome these limitations, this study developed
   a new method called downscaling method based on optical trapezoid model
   (DespiTe), which improves the spatial resolution of passive microwave
   derived SM products by using only optical remote sensing data. This
   method relies on the linear relationship between SM and the
   shortwave-infrared transformed (STR) reflectance, which is less affected
   by weather conditions. Thus, the DespiTe method needs to be
   parameterized only once for each area. By establishing statistical
   relationships between optical parameters (normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) and STR) and passive microwave derived SM
   observations, the DespiTe method enables a higher spatial resolution SM
   estimation to be derived. The downscaling results from DespiTe were
   evaluated with aircraft and in situ observed SM data acquired during the
   SMAPEx-4 and SMAPVEX16 field experiments. Moreover, these results were
   compared with those from disaggregation based on physical and
   theoretical scale change (DisPATCh), a commonly used thermal-based
   downscaling method. A comparison against aircraft SM data showed that
   the DespiTe method achieved an unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE)
   of 0.026 m(3)/m(3), which outperformed the DisPATCh method that achieved
   a ubRMSE of 0.059 m(3)/m(3).},

   learning},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {212},
Number = {B},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Soil moisture in the root zone is the most important factor in
   eco-hydrological processes. Even though soil moisture can be obtained by
   remote sensing, limited to the top few centimeters (< 5 cm). Researchers
   have attempted to estimate root-zone soil moisture using multiple
   regression, data assimilation, and data-driven methods. However,
   correlations between root-zone soil moisture and its related variables,
   including surface soil moisture, always appear nonlinear, which is
   difficult to extract and express using typical statistical methods. The
   artificial intelligence (AI) method, which is advantageous for nonlinear
   relationship analysis and extraction is applied for root-zone soil
   moisture estimation, but by only considering its separate temporal or
   spatial correlations. The convolutional long short-term memory
   (ConvLSTM) model, known to capture spatiotemporal patterns of
   large-scale sequential datasets with the advantage of dealing with
   spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, was used in this study to
   estimate root-zone soil moisture based on remote sensing-based
   variables. Owing to limitation of regional soil moisture observation
   data, the physical model Hydrus-1D was used to generate large and
   spatiotemporal vertical soil moisture dataset for the ConvLSTM model
   training and verification. Then, normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) etc. remote sensing-based factors were selected as predictive
   variables. Results of the ConvLSTM model showed that the fitting
   coefficients (R-2) of the root-zone soil moisture estimation
   significantly increased compared to those achieved by Global Land Data
   Assimilation System products, especially for deep layers. For example,
   R-2 increased from 0.02 to 0.60 at depth of 40 cm. This study suggests
   that a combination of the physical model and AI is a flexible tool
   capable of predicting spatiotemporally continuous root-zone soil
   moisture with good accuracy on a large scale.},

   dataset is a global, consistent, and long-term, remote sensing soil
   moisture (SM) dataset created using machine learning. It is based on the
   NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission SM data and
   is aimed at extrapolating SMAP-like quality SM back in time using
   previous satellite microwave platforms. CASM represents SM in the top
   soil layer, and it is defined on a global 25 km EASE-2 grid and for
   2002-2020 with a 3-day temporal resolution. The seasonal cycle is
   removed for the neural network training to ensure its skill is targeted
   at predicting SM extremes. CASM comparison to 367 global in-situ SM
   monitoring sites shows a SMAP-like median correlation of 0.66.
   Additionally, the SM product uncertainty was assessed, and both
   aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties were estimated and included in the
   dataset. CASM dataset can be used to study a wide range of hydrological,
   carbon cycle, and energy processes since only a consistent long-term
   dataset allows assessing changes in water availability and water stress.},

Abstract = {An uneasy population increase requires expansion of the agricultural
   area. Egypt has a strategic direction in expanding agricultural areas,
   which highlights the objective of the research that is to assess soil
   fertility through its geographical assessment and remote sensing. The
   examination region of this investigation is situated in north region of
   west desert, about 55 km, west of Cairo, Egypt. A semi-detail survey was
   carried out using remote sensing (RS) and geographic information systems
   (GIS) for the study. The results found the high suitable areas (S-1) for
   field crops; barley and wheat were about 54.7\% for each of the total
   area, while for corn and beans were about 44.9\% for each of the total
   area, while S-1 areas for vegetable crops; tomato, eggplant, and melon
   were 67.8, 71.2, and 53.2\% of the total area, respectively, while S-2
   for pepper-zucchini was about 65.4 and 49.7\% of the total area,
   respectively. But for fruit trees, S-1 is for pears (60.3\%),
   pomegranates (50.9\%), and palms (80.2\%) while S-2 for olives (30.3\%),
   Figs. (30.3\%), almonds (10.4\%), vines (19.7\%), and peaches (20.5\%).
   To reduce water losses is by improving the means of delivery and raising
   the efficiency of irrigation, by evaluating the appropriate situation of
   the irrigation system for soil quality in the study area, and by
   choosing the appropriate methods of irrigation in the region to raise
   efficiency in rationalizing consumption and reducing losses. Drip and
   sprinkle irrigation suitability for the entire area are moderate to
   high, where soil texture factor is limiting drip irrigation method while
   wind speed and soil texture factors are limiting sprinkle irrigation in
   the area.},

Abstract = {A multi-scale soil moisture monitoring strategy for California was
   designed to inform water resource management. The proposed workflow
   classifies soil moisture response units (SMRUs) using publicly available
   datasets that represent soil, vegetation, climate, and hydrology
   variables, which control soil water storage. The SMRUs were classified,
   using principal component analysis and unsupervised K-means clustering
   within a geographic information system, and validated, using summary
   statistics derived from measured soil moisture time series. Validation
   stations, located in the Sierra Nevada, include transect of sites that
   cross the rain-to-snow transition and a cluster of sites located at
   similar elevations in a snow-dominated watershed. The SMRUs capture
   unique responses to varying climate conditions characterized by
   statistical measures of central tendency, dispersion, and extremes. A
   topographic position index and landform classification is the final step
   in the workflow to guide the optimal placement of soil moisture sensors
   at the local-scale. The proposed workflow is highly flexible and can be
   implemented over a range of spatial scales and input datasets can be
   customized. Our approach captures a range of soil moisture responses to
   climate across California and can be used to design and optimize soil
   moisture monitoring strategies to support runoff forecasts for water
   supply management or to assess landscape conditions for forest and

Title = {Quasi-3D mapping of soil moisture in agricultural fields using
   electrical conductivity sensing},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {259},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Knowledge of real time spatial distribution of soil moisture has great
   potential to improve yield and profit in agricultural systems. Recent
   advances in non-invasive electromagnetic induction (EMI) techniques have
   created an opportunity to determine soil moisture content with
   high-resolution and minimal soil intrusion. So far, EMI has mainly been
   used for homogenous soil conditions, which are not common in agriculture
   and results are mainly validated by excavated pits or calibration models
   using soil samples on a transect. This study converts apparent
   electrical conductivity data recorded with a Dualem-1Hs EM-metre for two
   surveys of variable moisture conditions (dry and wet season) with 2475
   and 2174 data points over 5.4 ha, in a field with a contrasting vertical
   soil profile into spatiotemporal management zones. A least square
   inversion algorithm was used to determine electrical conductivities for
   individual soil layers of 0-0.5 m, 0.5-0.8 m and 0.8-1.6 m. Soil samples
   from the depth of 0.5 m and 0.8 m were used for soil moisture
   calibrations. A laboratory experiment under controlled conditions
   developed electric conductivity vs volumetric water content relations
   with power law functions for required soil depth slices with R 2 values
   between 0.98 and 0.99. Subsequently, EMI data were converted to
   volumetric water contents for each layer and predictions were spatially
   displayed. Median change between the measured apparent conductivity and
   inverted values range from 6 to 17 mS m(-1) resulting in 3-7\%
   difference in volumetric water prediction. These EMI based soil moisture
   predictions were compared with neutron moisture metre measurements, with
   Pearson R values of 0.74 and 0.95 for the wet and dry season surveys,
   respectively. The method is robust and offers a comparatively fast
   method to estimate the soil moisture status in fields and subsequently
   make informed management decisions.},

Abstract = {In agricultural field, compact sensors that can measure both water
   content and electric conductivity are needed. Focusing on the fact that
   water content and conductivity depend on soil impedance, our group has
   been developing a new compact and noise-resistant driving circuit that
   measured soil impedance by detecting transient characteristics of the
   voltage obtained by injecting current through the soil and converting it
   to frequency information. In order to realize agricultural field
   measurements with sensors using this new driving circuit, it had been
   necessary to miniaturize the part that detected the output from the
   driving circuit, but it hadn't been achieved in our previous work. In
   this research, a microcomputer-based frequency counter was developed to
   downsize the system for on-site measurement. In general, there are two
   methods of frequency measurement: direct counting and reciprocal. The
   direct-counting method is suited for high-frequency measurements, while
   the reciprocal method is suited for low-frequency measurements. The
   developed frequency counter could measure with an error of 0.005\% over
   the assumed frequency range by switching between those two measurement
   methods according to the measured frequency. Using this driving circuit
   and frequency counter, we measured the model soil and succeeded in
   capturing changes in water content as changes in impedance.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture represents many attributes of the geo-hydrological cycle

   emerging tool could be utilized to collect soil moisture data. A pilot
   study area was selected in Shahriar, Iran. A user interface and a

   to analyze the subjective and gravimetric soil moisture data.
   Furthermore, explanatory moisture condition (EMC), a new initiative to
   consider land use in soil moisture information from vegetation cover,
   was evaluated. A statistical artificial neural network was used for
   quantifying subjective data, and soil moisture layouts were produced by
   utilizing the ordinary kriging (OK) method. For cross-validating, the
   land surface temperature data from the MODIS satellite were retrieved. A
   platform for the region with 200 m grids resolution to collect daily
   soil moisture at eight ungauged stations is proposed to utilize
   subjective data from the subscribers and cross-validated with satellite
   data. A virtual station at the centroid of the pervious part of the

Abstract = {Relative to other geophysical variables, soil moisture (SM) estimates
   derived from land surface models (LSMs) and land data assimilation
   systems (LDAS) are difficult to transfer between platforms and
   applications. This difficulty stems from the highly model-dependent
   nature of LSM SM estimates and differences in the vertical support of
   discretized SM values. As a result, operational SM estimates generated
   by one LSM (or LDAS) cannot generally be directly applied to a
   hydrologic monitoring or forecast system designed around a second LSM.
   This lack of transferability is particularly problematic for LDAS
   applications, where the time, expertise, and computational resources
   required to generate an operational LDAS analysis cannot be practically
   duplicated for every LSM-specific application. Here, we develop a set of
   simple regression tools for translating SMestimates between LSMs
   andmultiple LDAS analyses. Results demonstrate that simple multivariate
   linear regression-utilizing independent variables based on multilayer
   and temporally lagged SM estimates-can significantly improve upon
   baseline transformation approaches using direct percentile matching. The
   proposed regression approaches are effective for both the LSM-to-LSM and
   LDAS-to-LDAS transformation of multilayer SM percentiles. Application of
   this approach will expand the utility of existing, high-quality (but
   LSM-specific) operational sources of SM information like the NASA Soil
   Moisture Active Passive Level-4 Soil Moisture product.},

Abstract = {An effective soil moisture retrieval method for FY-3E (Fengyun-3E)
   GNOS-R (GNSS occultation sounder II-reflectometry) is developed in this
   paper. Here, the LAGRS model, which is totally oriented for GNOS-R, is
   employed to estimate vegetation and surface roughness effects on surface
   reflectivity. Since the LAGRS (land surface GNSS reflection simulator)
   model is a space-borne GNSS-R (GNSS reflectometry) simulator based on
   the microwave radiative transfer equation model, the method presented in
   this paper takes more consideration on the physical scattering
   properties for retrieval. Ancillary information from SMAP (soil moisture
   active passive) such as the vegetation water content and the roughness
   coefficient are investigated for the final algorithm's development. At
   first, the SR (surface reflectivity) data calculated from GNOS-R is
   calculated and then calibrated, and then the vegetation roughness factor
   is achieved and used to eliminate the effects on both factors. After
   receiving the Fresnel reflectivity, the corresponding soil moisture
   estimated from this method is retrieved. The results demonstrate good
   consistency between soil moisture derived from GNOS-R data and SMAP soil
   moisture, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9599 and a root mean
   square error of 0.0483 cm(3)/cm(3). This method succeeds in providing
   soil moisture on a global scale and is based on the previously developed
   physical LAGRS model. In this way, the great potential of GNOS-R for
   soil moisture estimation is presented.},

Abstract = {The distributed unit hydrograph (DUH) method has been widely used for
   flow routing in a watershed because it adequately characterizes the
   underlying surface characteristics and varying rainfall intensity.
   Fundamental to the calculation of DUH is flow velocity. However, the
   currently used velocity formula assumes a global equilibrium of the
   watershed and ignores the impact of time-varying soil moisture content
   on flow velocity, which thus leads to a larger flow velocity. The
   objective of this study was to identify a soil moisture content factor,
   which, based on the tension water storage capacity curve, was derived to
   investigate the response of DUH to soil moisture content in unsaturated
   areas. Thus, an improved distributed unit hydrograph, based on
   time-varying soil moisture content, was obtained. The proposed DUH
   considered the impact of both time-varying rainfall intensity and soil
   moisture content on flow velocity, assuming the watershed to be not in
   equilibrium but varying with soil moisture. The Qin River basin and
   Longhu River basin were selected as two case studies, and the synthetic
   unit hydrograph (SUH), the time-varying distributed unit hydrograph
   (TDUH) and the current DUH methods were compared with the proposed
   method. Then, the influence of time-varying soil moisture content on
   flow velocity and flow routing was evaluated, and results showed that
   the proposed method performed the best among the four methods. The shape
   and duration of the unit hydrograph (UH) were mainly related to the soil
   moisture content at the initial stage of a rainstorm, and when the
   watershed was approximately saturated, the grid flow velocity was mainly
   dominated by excess rainfall. The proposed method can be used for the
   watersheds with sparse gauging stations and limited observed rainfall
   and runoff data.},

Abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture
   Active-Passive (SMAP) mission characterizes global spatiotemporal
   patterns in surface soil moisture using dual L-band microwave retrievals
   of horizontal (T-Bh) and vertical (T-B(v)) polarized microwave
   brightness temperatures through a modeled mechanistic relationship
   between vegetation opacity, surface scattering albedo, and soil
   effective temperature (T-eff). Although this model has been validated
   against in situ soil moisture, there is a lack of systematic
   characterization of where and why SMAP estimates deviate from the in
   situ observations. Here, we assess how the information content of in
   situ soil moisture observations from the US Climate Reference Network
   contrasts with (1) the information contained within raw SMAP
   observations (i.e., ``informational random uncertainty{''}) derived from
   T-Bh, T-B(v), and T-eff themselves and with (2) the information
   contained in SMAP's dual-channel algorithm (DCA) soil moisture estimates
   (i.e., ``informational model uncertainty{''}) derived from the model's
   inherent structure and parameterizations. The results show that, on
   average, 80 \% of the information in the in situ soil moisture is
   unexplained by SMAP DCA soil moisture estimates. Loss of information in
   the DCA modeling process contributes 35 \% of the unexplained
   information, while the remainder is induced by a lack of additional
   explanatory power within T-Bh, T-B(v), and T-eff. Overall, retrieval
   quality of SMAP DCA soil moisture, denoted as the Pearson correlation
   coefficient between SMAP DCA soil moisture and in situ soil moisture, is
   negatively correlated with the informational uncertainties, with slight
   differences across different land covers. The informational model
   uncertainty (Pearson correlation of -0.59) was found to be more
   influential than the informational random uncertainty (Pearson
   correlation of -0.34), suggesting that the poor performance of SMAP DCA
   at some locations is driven by model parameterization and/or structure
   and not underlying satellite measurements of T-Bh and T-B(v). A
   decomposition of mutual information between T-Bh, T-B(v), and DCA soil
   moisture shows that on average 58 \% of information provided by T-Bh and
   T-B(v) to DCA estimates is redundant. The amount of information
   redundantly and synergistically provided by T-Bh and T-Bv, was found to
   be closely related (Pearson correlations of 0.79 and -0.82,
   respectively) to the retrieval quality of SMAP DCA. T-Bh and T-Bv tend
   to contribute large redundant information to DCA estimates under
   surfaces or conditions where DCA makes better retrievals. This study
   provides a baseline approach that can also be applied to evaluate other
   remote sensing models and understand informational loss as satellite
   retrievals are translated to end-user products.},

Title = {A Review of Earth's Surface Soil Moisture Retrieval Models via Remote
   Sensing},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is essential parameter in the Earth's surface. The
   information provided by soil moisture plays a vital role in agricultural
   production, eco-environmental protection, water and land resources
   management, etc. Meanwhile, the accurate monitoring of the spatial and
   temporal distribution of soil moisture is of great significance for the
   engineering geological assessment and geological disaster prevention.
   Monitoring and retrieving soil moisture via remote sensing data and
   mathematical models are the main research methods at present and the
   crucial issue is how to eliminate the influence of other surface and
   soil parameters like roughness and soil bulk density, and the
   interference of vegetated areas to electromagnetic waves. Nowadays, many
   branches of retrieval methods have been developed, and researchers are
   integrating multiple models to improve the retrieval accuracy. This
   paper summarizes the present research status and progress of soil
   moisture retrieval via remote sensing based on four kinds of models:
   empirical model, semi-empirical model, physical model, and machine
   learning. The soil moisture products are summarized and listed at the
   same time. The difficulties and issues in the present research are
   discussed and the future outlook is explored.},

Title = {Using of Remote Sensing-Based Auxiliary Variables for Soil Moisture
   Scaling and Mapping},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is one of the core hydrological and climate variables that
   crucially influences water and energy budgets. The spatial resolution of
   available soil moisture products is generally coarser than 25 km, which
   limits their hydro-meteorological and eco-hydrological applications and
   the management of water resources at watershed and agricultural scales.
   A feasible solution to overcome these limitations is to downscale coarse
   soil moisture products with the support of higher-resolution spatial
   information. Although many auxiliary variables have been used for this
   purpose, few studies have analyzed their applicability and effectiveness
   in arid regions. To this end, we comprehensively evaluated four commonly
   used auxiliary variables, including NDVI (Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index), LST (Land Surface Temperature), TVDI (Temperature
   Vegetation Dryness Index), and SEE (Soil Evaporative Efficiency),
   against ground-based soil moisture observations during the vegetation
   growing season in the Heihe River Basin, China. Performance metrics
   indicated that SEE is most sensitive (R-2 >= 0.67) to soil moisture
   because it is controlled by soil evaporation limited by the available
   soil moisture. The similarity of spatial patterns also showed that SEE
   best captures soil moisture changes, with the STD (standard deviation)
   of the HD (Hausdorff Distance) less than 0.058 when compared with PLMR
   (Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer) soil moisture products. In
   addition, soil moisture was mapped by RF (Random Forests) using both
   single auxiliary variables and 11 types of multiple auxiliary variable
   combinations. SEE was found to be the best auxiliary variable for
   scaling and mapping soil moisture with accuracy of 0.035 cm(3)/cm(3).
   Among the multiple auxiliary variables, the combination of LST, NDVI,
   and SEE was found to best enhance the scaling and mapping accuracy of
   soil moisture with 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3).},

   signals of opportunity},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2024},

Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {Spaceborne radar remote sensing of the earth system is essential to
   study natural and man-made changes in the ecosystem, water and energy
   cycles, weather and air quality, sea level, and surface dynamics. A
   major challenge with current approaches is the lack of broad spectrum
   tunability due to narrow band microwave electronics, that limit systems
   to specific science variable retrievals. This results in a significant
   limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system processes such as
   surface and subsurface hydrology from a single compact instrument, where
   co-located broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to sense
   multiple variables simultaneously or over a short duration. Rydberg
   atomic sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors
   that can be dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no
   requirement for RF band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can
   use existing transmitted signals such as from navigation and
   communication satellites to enable remote sensing. We demonstrate remote
   sensing of soil moisture, an important earth system variable, via
   ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic systems. To do
   this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use
   signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for
   remote sensing of soil moisture.},

Title = {A Review of Root Zone Soil Moisture Estimation Methods Based on Remote
   Sensing},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) controls vegetation transpiration and
   hydraulic distribution processes and plays a key role in energy and
   water exchange between land surface and atmosphere; hence, accurate
   estimation of RZSM is crucial for agricultural irrigation management
   practices. Traditional methods to measure soil moisture at stations are
   laborious and spatially uneven, making it difficult to obtain soil
   moisture data on a large scale. Remote sensing techniques can provide
   soil moisture in a large-scale range, but they can only provide surface
   soil moisture (SSM) with a depth of approximately 5-10 cm. In order to
   obtain a large range of soil moisture for deeper soil layers, especially
   the crop root zone with a depth of about 100-200 cm, numerous methods
   based on remote sensing inversion have been proposed. This paper
   analyzes and summarizes the research progress of remote sensing-based
   RZSM estimation methods in the past few decades and classifies these
   methods into four categories: empirical methods, semi-empirical methods,
   physics-based methods, and machine learning methods. Then, the
   advantages and disadvantages of various methods are outlined.
   Additionally an outlook on the future development of RZSM estimation
   methods is made and discussed.},

Journal = {LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {3},
Pages = {911-925},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Machine learning combined with multisource remote sensing data to assess
   soil moisture content (SMC) has attracted considerable attention in SMC
   studies, but the retrieval results still remain uncertain. The purpose
   of this study is to combine multiple single machine learning models with
   integrated learning algorithms and propose an SMC retrieval method based
   on multiple differentiated models under a stacking integrated learning
   architecture. First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering
   coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were
   extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the
   highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the
   Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning
   methods-classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting
   decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two
   stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection
   operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were
   tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation
   model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient,
   temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature,
   enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most
   important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A
   comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August
   showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy,
   with root mean square error values of 1.87\% and 1.64\%, respectively.
   The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine
   learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated
   model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter
   coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil
   surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for
   land desertification studies and ecological environment management in
   the study region.},

Title = {Challenges in determining soil moisture and evaporation fluxes using
   distributed temperature sensing methods},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {261},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {To protect fragile groundwater-dependent environments of arid zones, it
   is important to monitor soil moisture and groundwater evaporation.
   Hence, it is important to assess new methods to quantify these
   environmental variables. In this work, we propose a new method to
   determine groundwater evaporation rates by combining the actively heated
   fiber-optic (AHFO) method with vadose zone modeling, assuming that the
   evaporation front remains at the soil surface. In our study, the AHFO
   method yielded estimates of the soil moisture (theta) profile with a
   spatial resolution of similar to 6.5 mm and with an error of 0.026 m(3)
   m(-3). The numerical model resulted in a slightly different theta
   profile than that measured, where the largest differences occurred at
   the soil surface. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses highlighted that
   a better precision is required when determining the soil hydraulic
   parameters. To improve the proposed method, the soil heat-vapor-water
   dynamics should be included and the assumption that the evaporation
   front remains at the soil surface must be relaxed. Additionally, if the
   AHFO calibration curve is enhanced, the errors of the estimated theta
   profile can be reduced and thus, successful estimation of the
   evaporation rates for a wider range of soil textures can be achieved.
   The spatial scales measured are an important advantage of the proposed
   method that should be further explored to improve the analysis presented
   here.},

   Estimation in an Agricultural Field},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Gamma-ray spectroscopy (GRS) enables continuous estimation of soil water
   content (SWC) at the subfield scale with a noninvasive sensor.
   Hydrological applications, including hyper-resolution land surface
   models and precision agricultural decision making, could benefit greatly
   from such SWC information, but a gap exists between established theory
   and accurate estimation of SWC from GRS in the field. In response, we
   conducted a robust three-year field validation study at a
   well-instrumented agricultural site in Nebraska, United States. The
   study involved 27 gravimetric water content sampling campaigns in maize
   and soybean and 40K specific activity (Bq kg-1) measurements from a
   stationary GRS sensor. Our analysis showed that the current method for
   biomass water content correction is appropriate for our maize and
   soybean field but that the ratio of soil mass attenuation to water mass
   attenuation used in the theoretical equation must be adjusted to
   satisfactorily describe the field data. We propose a calibration
   equation with two free parameters: the theoretical 40K intensity in dry
   soil and a, which creates an ``effective{''} mass attenuation ratio.
   Based on statistical analyses of our data set, we recommend calibrating
   the GRS sensor for SWC estimation using 10 profiles within the footprint
   and 5 calibration sampling campaigns to achieve a cross-validation root
   mean square error below 0.035 g g-1.},

Abstract = {The efficient management of irrigation water can affect crop
   profitability quite significantly. The application of precision
   irrigation based on soil monitoring can help manage water resources. In
   viticulture, the irrigation technique is thought to strongly influence
   grape ripening and the final grape composition. In this study, an
   irrigation decision support system was compared to a surface drip
   irrigation system in a commercial vineyard located in Andrea (Southern
   Italy) planted with Vitis vinifera cv. Montepulciano. We aimed to
   investigate the ability of the DSS to save water while maintaining an
   acceptable yield and quality of the grapes. To allow for the comparison,
   eco-physiological as well as yield parameters were measured during the
   irrigation periods in both irrigation systems over two years (2019 and
   2020). The results indicate that the vines grown using the DSS treatment
   were less stressed compared to the plants grown using farm irrigation in
   both years. The yield attributes showed slight or no significant
   differences between the treatments. The quality results showed no
   significant differences between the treatments in both years. Our
   results indicate that with savings of 10\% and 17\% of the irrigation
   water in the first and second year, respectively, the DSS was able to
   maintain good yield and quality levels as compared to the farm
   irrigation system. These two-year results provide a promising

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {609},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soil water is a critical component of the water balance to make water
   management decisions at multiple scales. While soil water can be sensed
   remotely, this is generally at coarse scales (> 12.5 km). In addition,
   soil moisture products developed at field scale resolutions (< 250 m)
   have been mostly limited to shallow observations (up to 10 cm depth) and
   are impacted by land use. The objective of this study was to create an
   accurate downscaled soil water content product at multiple depths and at
   a fine 90 m resolution by fusing modelled and remote sensing datasets
   via deep learning. Reference data was based on the OzFlux and Oznet
   networks. Covariates included the North America Space Agency (NASA)
   United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) remote sensing data assimilation model, Sentinel 1 from
   Copernicus, surface reflectance, land surface temperature and land cover
   from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and
   gridded soil properties. Two model approaches were used including a
   multilayer perceptron for the surface (0-10 cm), and recurrent neural
   networks for the surface/subsurface (0-30 cm and 30-60 cm) soil water
   content. The surface prediction performance resulted in a root mean
   square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and Pearson's correlation
   of 0.073, 0.057, and 0.74, degrading in depth to 0.07, 0.062, and 0.5.
   Overall, these 90 m resolution predictions improve on the performance of
   NASA-USDA SMAP (10 km resolution) and the Australian Landscape Water
   Balance (5 km resolution) simulated soil water contents. Land use/land
   cover (LULC) are important explaining factors for performance and
   SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicate high impor-tance of
   NASA-USDA SMAP for surface predictions, while soil properties and LULC
   increase in importance with depth.},

   Technology in Africa},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Evaluating the long-term spatiotemporal variability in soil moisture
   (SM) over Africa is crucial for understanding how crop production is
   affected by drought or flooding. However, the lack of continuous and
   stable long-term series and high-resolution soil moisture records
   impedes such research. To overcome the inconsistency of different
   microwave sensors (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS, AMSR-E;
   Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, SMOS; and Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer 2, AMSR2) in measuring soil moisture over time and depth, we
   built a time series reconstruction model to correct SM, and then used a
   Spatially Weighted Downscaling Model to downscale the SM data from three
   different sensors to a 1 km spatial resolution. The verification of the
   reconstructed data shows that the product has high accuracy, and can be
   used for application and analysis. The spatiotemporal trends of SM in
   Africa were examined for 2003-2017. The analysis indicated that soil
   moisture is declining in Africa as a whole, and it is notably higher in
   central Africa than in other subregions. The most significant decrease
   in SM was observed in the savanna zone (slope < -0.08 m(3) m(-3) and P <
   0.001), followed by South Africa and Namibia (slope < -0.07 m(3) m(-3)
   and P < 0.01). Seasonally, the most significant downward trends in SM
   were observed during the spring, mainly over eastern and central Africa
   (slope < -0.07 m(3) m(-3), R < -0.58 and P < 0.001). The analysis of
   spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture can help improve the
   understanding of hydrological cycles, and provide benchmark information

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {271},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Irrigation scheduling based on soil water content (Ow) sensors requires
   that Ow be maintained within a range (management lines) that is optimal
   for plant growth. The lower limit or ``breaking point `` is determined
   following the soil water content dynamics on the transition of a rapid
   rate of depletion to a slower, under similar reference
   evapotranspiration. Although this criterion is practical, its
   implementation should be validated with plant water status measurement
   that contemplate weather condition, such as stem water potential
   ``non-stressed `` baseline (Tx as a function of vapor-pressure deficit
   (VPD) in Ow conditions that do not limit yield). A study was con-ducted
   on a mature cv. `Hass' avocado orchard in Central Chile during two
   seasons. There were 5 irrigation treatments: T1, Control; T2 and T3 with
   29\% less and 25\% more of what was applied in T1, respectively; T4 and
   T5 same as Control until first and second fruit drop abscission,
   respectively, and then with 29\% less. T1 trees were irrigated using a
   continuous frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) probe to maintain the
   root zone be-tween field capacity and the breaking point. There was
   biweekly monitoring of the Ow prior to irrigation, Tx and VPD. The Tx
   decline proportional to the intensity and the timing of water
   restriction; however, no treatment affected the crop load in either
   season. T2 did not show significant detrimental in fruit size,
   production and maturation, despite that frequently reached water content
   levels at the limit of the breaking point, and showed lower levels of
   stem water potential than Control, being the treatment with the highest
   water productivity. The results confirm that breaking point is an
   effective criterion to establish irrigation management. Additionally,
   when comparing the baseline for our non-stressed trees with a baseline
   from full irrigation treatments obtained from the literature, 30\% water
   savings were achieved.},

Title = {Monitoring Waterlogging Damage of Winter Wheat Based on HYDRUS-1D and

Abstract = {Waterlogging harms winter wheat growth. To enable accurate monitoring of
   agricultural waterlogging, this paper conducts a winter wheat
   waterlogging monitoring study using multi-source data in Guzhen County,
   Anhui Province, China. The hydrological model HYDRUS-1D is coupled with
   the crop growth model WOFOST, and the Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to
   assimilate Sentinel-1 inversion soil moisture data. According to the
   precision and continuity of soil moisture, the damage of winter wheat
   waterlogging were obtained. The experimental results show that the
   accuracy of the soil moisture is improved after data assimilation
   compared with that before data assimilation, and the Nash-Sutcliffe
   efficiency (NSE) of the simulated soil moisture values at three
   monitoring sites increased from 0.528, 0.541 and 0.575 to 0.752, 0.692
   and 0.731, respectively. A new waterlogging identification criterion has
   been proposed based on the growth periods and probability distribution
   of soil moisture. The proportion, calculated from this identification
   criterion, of the waterlogging wheat farmland in total farmland shows a
   high correlation with the yield reduction rate. The correlation
   coefficient of the waterlogging farmland proportion and the yield
   reduction rate in 11 towns of Guzhen County reaches 0.78. Through the
   synchronization of geography, agriculture and meteorology, the framework
   shows great potential in waterlogging monitoring.},

Title = {Applicability of cosmic-ray neutron sensing for measuring soil water
   content to heterogeneous landscapes under subtropical hydroclimatic
   conditions},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {596},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is one of the few techniques that can
   directly acquire information about the temporal dynamics of soil water
   content (SWC) at a hectometer scale. The performance of CRNS depends on
   the climate, soil and conditions of the underlying surface. The region
   of red soil in China is characterized by heterogeneous land uses
   (combination of upland and paddy fields), distinct dry-wet periods and
   low contents of soil organic carbon. The applicability of CRNS has not
   yet been evaluated under the subtropical hydroclimatic conditions of
   this region. We therefore compared spatially averaged SWC measured using
   CRNS with point-scale data measured using time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) at five locations and oven-dried soil samples collected at 27
   locations across the CRNS footprint in an agricultural ecosystem of the
   red-soil region between March 2019 and February 2020. The footprint of
   CRNS varied with time. The horizontal radius of CRNS varied between 175
   m in July and 215 m in October, with a mean of 194 m, and the measuring
   depth varied between 16 cm in March and 23 cm in August, with a mean of
   19 cm. The relative contribution of rainfed cropland, citrus land and
   paddy fields were 86.7, 10.7 and 2.6\%, respectively. The differences of
   the relative contribution among land uses were determined by the
   distance to the sensor and the area, which were less affected by the
   types of land use. The neutron count rate (N-0, counts/h) was weakly
   temporally variable, with a mean coefficient of variation of 3\%. The
   influence of its variation on the accuracy of CRNS, however, should not
   be ignored. Both the timing and frequency of sampling affected the
   calculation of N-0. Occasional sampling in the dry season is a
   recommended strategy to acquire an accurate N-0 of a region. CRNS
   performed well for determining the dynamics of spatially averaged SWC in
   heterogeneous landscapes. More specifically, the accuracy of CRNS was
   comparable with those using the oven-drying method, with R-2, root mean
   square error and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.86,
   0.026 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.81, respectively. This study evaluated the
   applicability of CRNS in a region with complex climatic, hydrological
   and underlying-surface conditions. These results are useful for
   developing a reasonable sampling strategy for acquiring an accurate N-0
   and calibrating the CRNS. Future studies, however, should focus on the
   application of the CRNS technique to resolve the eco-environmental
   issues of the region.},

Title = {Current sensor technologies for <i>in situ</i> and on-line measurement
   of soil nitrogen for variable rate fertilization: A review},
Booktitle = {ADVANCES IN AGRONOMY, VOL 168},
Series = {Advances in Agronomy},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {168},
Pages = {1-38},
Abstract = {Recommendations for nitrogen (N) fertilization are based on the analysis
   of the soil mineral N (SMN) content of one composite sample that is
   assumed to represent the average concentration, but that almost by
   definition fails to properly represent the inherent spatial variability
   of the field. Improvement in N management can thus be achieved by
   high-resolution measurements of the soil N status. However, soil
   sampling, transportation, sample preparation and laboratory analysis are
   laborious, costly and time-consuming. Additionally, errors associated
   with all these steps (particularly sampling and sample preparation) are
   notorious sources of inaccuracy. In situ and on-line measurement modes
   could overcome these drawbacks. This paper presents a state-of-the-art
   review of proximal soil sensing technologies for in situ and on-line
   measurements of total nitrogen (TN) and mineral N in soils. Visible and
   near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) and mid-infrared spectroscopy
   (MIRS) have been successfully used in in situ and on-line measurement
   platforms for determining TN. The review also focuses on data fusion
   (DF) approaches not only to improve the prediction performance of TN by
   vis-NIRS and MIRS but also to delineate management zones for
   site-specific N management. Electrochemical sensors such as
   ion-selective electrodes (ISE) or ion-selective field-effect transistors
   (ISFET) were found to be the most suitable to measure SMN. However, it
   was found that both sensor technologies are difficult to use for on-line
   measurements because they require the preparation of a soil solution and
   sufficient time delay is needed to reach a stable plateau. These
   limitations restrict the implementation of electrochemical sensing tools
   for site-specific N management, although they are the best methods to
   measure SMN, a needed parameter as a direct measure to determine N
   recommendations. Research on proximal soil sensing (PSS) for N
   measurement in soils should focus on the development of robust and
   accurate in situ and on-line sensors for SMN, whereas improvement in the
   performance of vis-NIRS and MIRS for TN prediction by using advanced
   modelling and DF techniques is recommended. This development is
   essential to promote the implementation of variable rate N fertilization
   (VRNF). The review suggested the fusion of on-line collected soil data
   with crop data, present and historical yield, topography and weather
   conditions as the optimal solution for map-based and sensor-based VRNF
   scenarios. Furthermore, a new approach for VRNF, designated as the
   map-sensor-based approach, is proposed. In this approach, management
   zones (MZ) maps for the soil is developed in advance at the beginning of
   the cropping season, and this information is combined with current crop
   growth status {[}e.g., normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI)],
   measured with a proximal crop sensor to calculate the recommendation and
   implement VRNF in real-time.},

Title = {Investigating the Potential of Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing for Estimating
   Soil Water Content in Farmland and Mountainous Areas},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The conventional methods of estimating soil water content (SWC) are
   mainly based on in situ measurements at sampling points and remote
   sensing measurements over an entire region. In view of these methods,
   cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has received increasing attention in
   recent years as a mesoscale, noncontact SWC estimation technology that
   can provide more accurate and timely estimates of SWC over a larger
   area. In this study, we estimated SWC using both CRNS and soil-mounted
   detectors in farmland and mountainous areas, and evaluated the accuracy
   of the estimations at two experimental sites. Ultra-rapid adaptable
   neutron-only simulation (URANOS) was used to simulate the detection
   radius and depth of the two experimental sites and to obtain the spatial
   weights of the CRNS footprint. The results show that the theoretical
   range of detection was reduced in farmland compared to mountainous areas
   during the experimental period, suggesting that farmland retained more
   SWC even with less precipitation. Spatial weights were simulated to
   calculate the SWC of sampling points, and the weighted and averaged SWC
   were then correlated with CRNS. The weighting calculation improves the
   accuracy of CRNS estimations, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of
   0.645 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046 cm(3)center dot
   cm(-3) for farmland, and reproduces the daily dynamics of SWC. The R-2
   and RMSE in mountainous areas are 0.773 and 0.049 cm(3)center dot
   cm(-3), respectively, and the estimation accuracy of CRNS cannot be
   improved by the weighting calculation. The estimation accuracy of CRNS
   is acceptable in both regions, but the mountainous terrain obstructs
   neutron transmission, causing a deviation between the actual and
   theoretical neutron footprints in mountainous areas. Thus, the accuracy
   of SWC estimation is limited in mountainous terrain. In conclusion, this
   study demonstrates that CRNS is suitable for use in farmland and
   mountainous areas and that further attention should be given to the
   effects of topography and vegetation when it is applied in mountainous
   environments.},

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of soil moisture is crucial for agricultural drought
   monitoring. Data assimilation has proven to be a promising technique for
   improving soil moisture estimation, and various studies have been
   conducted on soil moisture data assimilation based on land surface
   models. However, crop growth models, which are ideal tools for
   agricultural simulation applications, are rarely used for soil moisture
   assimilation. Moreover, the role of data assimilation in agricultural
   drought monitoring is seldom investigated. In the present work, we
   assimilated the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative
   (CCI) soil moisture product into the Decision Support System for
   Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model to estimate surface and root-zone
   soil moisture, and we evaluated the effect of data assimilation on
   agricultural drought monitoring. The results demonstrate that the soil
   moisture estimates were significantly improved after data assimilation.
   Root-zone soil moisture had a better agreement with in situ observation.
   Compared with the drought index based on soil moisture modeled without
   remotely-sensed observations, the drought index based on assimilated
   data could improve at least one drought level in agricultural drought
   monitoring and performed better when compared with winter wheat yield.
   In conclusion, crop growth model-based data assimilation effectively
   improves the soil moisture estimation and further strengthens soil
   moisture-based drought indices for agricultural drought monitoring.},

Abstract = {Volumetric soil water content (VSWC) monitoring is an important aspect
   of environmental monitoring of farmland. Accurate and real-time
   determination of the VSWC is important for crop drought stress diagnosis
   and smart irrigation. Image technology is commonly used in agricultural
   information technology. Based on image technology, we simulated the
   optimal frequency of the sensors to automatically collect VSWC data,
   thereby solving the problems of data redundancy and data analysis
   difficulties in real-time monitoring. In this study, a cotton field
   under mulched drip irrigation in 2018 was utilised as the research
   subject, 5TE sensors were arranged on the soil profile of the cotton
   field using the ``grid method{''}, and Voxler and Surfer software was
   used to model the VSWC data and draw contour maps. Image processing
   technology (image greyscale and image similarity comparison) was
   employed to determine the image algorithm suitable for contour map
   pre-processing and the best time period for VSWC monitoring. These
   results indicated that the contrast-limited adaptive histogram
   equalisation (CLAHE) greyscale algorithm is a suitable pre-processing
   algorithm for processing contour maps using image processing technology,
   and the best 5TE sensor data monitoring time period is every 10 h. This
   conclusion provides a theoretical reference for VSWC monitoring and

Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2024},

Pages = {633-642},
Abstract = {The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based remote sensing has drawn
   increased attention in precision agriculture. Lightweight optical and
   thermal sensors have been used widely on UAVs for a range of
   applications, and have been proposed by some as the best approach to map
   soil moisture at farm scales. However, passive microwave remote sensing
   has been widely acknowledged as the most accurate soil moisture mapping
   technology, and adopted by the soil moisture and ocean salinity and soil
   moisture active and passive satellite missions. Accordingly, it is
   postulated that this will also be the best technique for UAV-based
   near-surface soil moisture remote sensing, overcoming the spatial
   resolution limitation from low earth orbit altitude. Being so far
   limited by sensor availability, only a small number of studies have
   illustrated the potential of UAV-based near-surface soil moisture
   mapping using L-band microwave radiometers, and there has been no direct
   comparison with the thermal-optical alternative. To guide the design of
   future UAV-based soil moisture mapping systems, airborne optical,
   thermal infrared, and passive microwave observations collected from a
   scientific aircraft at low altitude over a center-pivot irrigation farm
   in Tasmania, Australia were used in this study to simulate UAV-based
   observations, and the performances of the thermal-optical and microwave
   techniques when compared at 75 m scale. The L-band microwave emission
   showed a superior sensitivity to near-surface soil moisture, and a
   higher and more consistent soil moisture retrieval accuracy than
   thermal-optical, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.05-0.06 m(3)/m(3)

   UNIVERSAL MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF THE ASABE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {739-749},
Abstract = {Soil moisture sensors are valuable tools in irrigation management, but
   due to soil spatial variability it is challenging for point-based
   sensors to characterize the entire soil water profile. Universal
   multiple linear regression (uMLR) is a simple machine learning tool that
   analyzes the relationship between all possible subsets of observations
   and the prediction of interest. This study used uMLR and volumetric
   water content data (VWC) taken from maize field experiments at the
   Limited Irrigation Research Farm near Greeley, Colorado, to optimize the
   number and placement of soil moisture sensors to characterize the entire
   soil water deficit (SWD) in the root zone. The uMLR analysis quantified
   the accuracy of using one or two VWC measurements to represent SWD. We
   evaluated seven field seasons, with 12 treatments and four replicates of
   each, where volumetric VWC was typically measured one to three times
   weekly. Results indicate that the best single sensor depth is at 30 cm,
   and the best combination of two sensors is at 0 to 15 cm and 60 cm. To
   validate the experiment, a continuous VWC sensor was used at 30 cm to
   predict SWD results with acceptable accuracy (RMSE = 4.60 mm). This
   study suggests that in the sandy loam site evaluated and with varying
   irrigation levels, soil moisture sensor placement near the soil surface
   along with knowledge of soil texture can be used to characterize SWD.
   This technique may be transferable to other locations and soils and
   shows potential for optimizing irrigation management via soil moisture
   sensor networks with continuous SWD data.},

Abstract = {Active canopy sensing may improve corn (Zea mays L.) nitrogen (N)
   management, but little has been done to evaluate soil N content to
   improve the utility of sensors. This study investigated the usefulness
   of integrating canopy sensing tools and soil N content to estimate grain
   yield and N requirement at various corn development stages. Six to seven
   N rates at 35-45 kg urea-N ha(-1) increments were pre-plant applied in
   12 sites throughout Minnesota. Canopy-sensing measurements were obtained
   at the V4, V8, V12, and R1 stages. Soil (0-30 and 0-60 cm) NH4-N and
   NO3-N concentrations were measured at the V4, V8, and V12 stages.
   Adjusting sensor measurements with soil NO3-N (0-30 cm) measured at the
   V4 stage provided the best trade-off between gains in prediction
   accuracy and practicality for soil sampling. At the V4 stage,
   predictions of N requirement with soil N alone (RMSE = 41.3 kg N ha(-1))

   kg N ha(-1)) were similar but better than predictions with unadjusted
   sensor measurements (RMSE ranging from 61.0 to 72.9 kg N ha(-1)).
   Although the utility of canopy sensing without soil-N adjustments
   improved at later development stages, the most accurate predictions of N
   requirement were obtained with soil-N-adjusted sensor measurements
   collected at V8 and V12 (RMSE as low as 32.5 kg N ha(-1)). Our study
   shows that early-season canopy sensing (up to V8) coupled with soil N
   measurements may be a viable alternative to improve in-season N
   management.},

Title = {Best Crop Rotation Selection with GIS-AHP Technique Using Soil Nutrient
   Variability},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Crop selections and rotations are very important in optimising land and
   labour productivities, enhancing higher cropping intensities, producing
   better crop yield. A land suitability analysis system based on the
   analytical hierarchy process (AHP) technique coupled with the Geographic
   Information System (GIS) software environment can be a unique tool for
   better crop selection. The AHP-GIS technique was used in land
   suitability analysis in crop rotation decisions, for rice-jute (Kharif
   season) and potato-lentil (Rabi season) crops in the Hooghly District,
   West Bengal, India. The study area covering 291 ha was classified based
   on eight major soil nutrient levels with 70 randomly selected plots for
   soil sampling and analysis. The soil nutrient variability was examined
   with descriptive statistics followed by best semivariogram-based model
   selection for kriging interpolation in the `R' software environment. The
   pairwise comparison matrix based ranking of parameters and giving
   weights was carried out considering the importance of each parameter for
   specific crops. The total area, being under the major rice-potato belt,
   could be classified from the suitability view point to the `highly
   suitable'(S-1) class occupying 29.2\%, and `not suitable' (N) class;
   4.5\% for rice, about 6.5\% of land is `highly suitable' (S-1), `and
   nearly 2.1\% area is `not suitable' (N) for jute; and 21.3\% is `highly
   suitable' (S-1) for potato and 12.4\% for lentil crops. The yield maps
   showed nearly 75\% and 90\% of the area for rice and potato crops,
   respectively, gave sound crop yield. Furthermore, the GIS platform was
   used for crop rotation analysis to spread multiple seasons ensuring
   better crop management in long run. Overall, 25\% of the rice crop area
   for jute in Kharif and 8\% of potato crop area for lentil in the Rabi
   season were recommended as replacements.},

Title = {Low-Cost and Low-Frequency Impedance Meter for Soil Water Content
   Measurement in the Precision Agriculture Scenario},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Abstract = {The use of low-cost embedded devices with ubiquitous connectivity
   systems is a possible strategy to monitor the consumption of water used
   in agriculture even in countries that do not have good economic
   resources. In this article, we propose a low-cost system based on a
   measuring approach of capacitive soil water content (SWC) sensors never
   explored previously. This solution takes advantage of the sensor
   properties to respond to the need to measure at the same time salinity
   and soil volumetric water content. For this purpose, a bifunctional
   system based on a modified commercial capacitive sensor and an AD5933
   impedance converter integrated circuit (IC) is described. The considered
   frequency range for impedance measurements is 10-100 kHz, which is a
   ``low-frequency{''} range compared with typical operating frequencies of
   professional systems devoted to water content measurements. Measurements
   are carried out to check the system accuracy and to characterize the
   impedance of the sensor both in the air and in water, which represent
   the two boundaries of possible operating conditions in physical soils in
   terms of the real part of the electrical permittivity. Variations of the
   imaginary part of the electrical permittivity are taken into account
   using water with conductivity between 1 and 2300 mu S/cm. Experimental
   results are compared with the measurements obtained by using a
   laboratory inductance in honor of Heinrich Lenz, capacitance and
   resistance (LCR) meter, and a maximum error of +6.12\% for the
   capacitance and +5.6\% for the conductance is obtained. The proposed
   system is also employed to characterize silica sandy soil with different
   water contents and conductivities showing quite promising results useful
   to overcome the well-known limits of low-cost SWC sensors.},

Abstract = {This research investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of
   volumetric soil water content (VWC) and total soil water across 64
   sampling locations (8 x 8 grid) in a production-scale field, reported as
   a unitextural soil unit by SSURGO. Consequently, the required number and
   placement of soil moisture monitoring locations were calculated to
   represent soil water status with varying degrees of variability. Each
   soil layer in the root zone was subject to 5-9\% of mean spatial VWC
   variability and maximum variability as high as 21\% during the 2014 and
   2015 growing seasons. Total soil water showed spatial behavior, which
   was as high as 13\%, with mean spatial variability of 5\%. In 2014, the
   field minimum and maximum temporal CVs in VWC were 9 and 27\%,
   respectively, which increased to 14 and 33\% in 2015, respectively.
   Representative soil moisture and its variability were accounted for
   using 1-45 monitoring locations, depending on observed variability,
   acceptable measurement error, and confidence interval (CI). When the
   commonly used marginal error of 2\% was considered, the numbers of
   sensor deployment locations were 8 (90\% CI) and 11 (95\% CI), which
   reduced to 5 (90\% CI) and 4 (95\% CI) sensors with 3\% marginal error.
   We demonstrate that although SSURGO data can be valuable to make
   preliminary assessments, relying on it to spatially characterize soil
   units and their properties for effective within-soil unit management,
   especially for variable rate water and nutrient applications, can create
   significant challenges.},

Title = {Effect of Water Absorbing Polymer Amendment on Performance of
   Capacitance Soil Moisture Sensor},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Water absorbing polymer (WAP) is emerging as soil amendment material for
   various soil infrastructures, such as urban green infrastructure, green
   roofs, landfill covers, and climate-resilient agriculture, to promote
   vegetation growth and thereby increase the sustainability of the
   projects. WAP amended soils experience alternating periods of drying and
   wetting because of their exposure to different climate conditions.
   Precise determination of volumetric water content (VWC) in vadose zone
   is required to establish the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) in WAP
   amended soils. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of a capacitance
   sensor (CS) for the purpose of continuous VWC monitoring in WAP amended
   soils. A controlled laboratory environment was used for the performance
   evaluation of CS in three different surface soils (sand, silt loam, and
   clay loam) with four WAP amendment rates (0 \%, 0.1 \%, 0.2 \%, and 0.4
   \%). The CS completely underestimates the VWC of WAP amended soils
   because of the bound water inside the WAP network. Two different
   calibration equations (i.e., third-order polynomial and linear) were
   recommended to enhance the precision of VWC measurement in WAP amended
   soils. The linear calibration method is further extended for obtaining a
   generalized calibration procedure valid for all soil textures and WAP
   concentrations. The importance of the proposed calibration procedure for
   a precise SWRC measurement of WAP amended soils was demonstrated. The
   results indicated that the error in VWC measurement further influences
   the saturated water content, field capacity, and permanent wilting
   point, which are essential parameters to estimate the soil-water
   storage, and irrigation water requirement.},

Volume = {22},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, machine learning models for an effective estimation of
   soil moisture content using a microwave short-range and wideband radar
   sensor are proposed. The soil moisture is measured as the volumetric
   water content using a short-range off-the-shelf radar sensor operating
   at 3-10 GHz. The radar captures the reflected signals that are post
   processed to determine the soil moisture which is mapped to the input
   features extracted from the reflected signals for the training of the
   machine learning models. In addition, the results are compared and
   analyzed with a contact-based Vernier soil sensor. Different machine
   learning models trained using neural network, support vector machine,
   linear regression and k-nearest neighbor are evaluated and presented in
   this work. The efficiency of the model is computed using root mean
   square error, co-efficient of determination and mean absolute error. The
   RMSE and MAE values of KNN, SVM and Linear Regression are 11.51 and
   9.27, 15.20 and 12.74, 3.94 and 3.54, respectively. It is observed that
   the neural network gives the best results with an R2 value of 0.9894.
   This research work has been carried out with an intention to develop
   cost-effective solutions for common users such as agriculturists to
   monitor the soil moisture conditions with improved accuracy.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop and calibrate a
   photovoltaic-powered soil moisture sensor (SMS) for irrigation
   management. Soil moisture readings obtained from the sensor were
   compared with gravimetric measurements. An automated SMS was used in two
   trials: (i) okra crop (Abelmoschus esculentus) and (ii) chili pepper
   (Capsicum frutescens). All sensors were calibrated and automated using
   an Arduino Mega board with C++. The soil moisture data were subjected to
   descriptive statistical analysis. The data recorded by the equipment was
   correlated with the gravimetric method. The determination coefficient
   (R-2), Pearson correlation (r), and root mean square error (RMSE) were
   adopted as criteria for equipment validation. The results show that our
   SMS achieved an R-2 value of 0.70 and an r value of 0.84. Notably, there
   was a striking similarity observed between SMS and gravimetric data,
   with RMSE values of 3.95 and 4.01, respectively. The global model
   developed exhibited highly efficient outcomes with R-2 (0.98) and r
   (0.99) values. The applicability of the developed SMS facilitates
   irrigation management with accuracy and real-time monitoring using
   digital data. The automation of the SMS emerges as a real-time and
   precise alternative for performing irrigation at the right moment and in
   the correct amount, thus avoiding water losses.},

   Large Areas},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {A correct soil moisture estimation is a fundamental prerequisite for
   many applications: agriculture, meteorological forecast, flood and
   drought prediction, and, in general, water accounting and management.
   Traditional methods typically provide point-like measurements, but
   suffer from soil heterogeneity, which can produce significant
   misinterpretation of the hydrological scenarios. In the last decade,
   cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged as a promising approach
   for the detection of soil moisture content. CRNS can average soil
   moisture over a large volume (up to tens of hectares) of terrain with
   only one probe, thus overcoming limitations arising from the
   heterogeneity of the soil. The present paper introduces the development
   of a new CRNS instrument designed for agricultural applications and
   based on an innovative neutron detector. The new instrument was applied
   and tested in two experimental fields located in Potsdam (DE, Germany)
   and Lagosanto (IT, Italy). The results highlight how the new detector
   could be a valid alternative and robust solution for the application of
   the CRNS technique for soil moisture measurements in agriculture.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring is a fundamental process to enhance
   agricultural outcomes and to protect the environment. The traditional
   methods for measuring moisture content in the soil are laborious and
   expensive, and therefore there is a growing interest in developing
   sensors and technologies which can reduce the effort and costs. In this
   work, we propose to use an autonomous mobile robot equipped with a
   state-of-the-art noncontact soil moisture sensor building moisture maps
   on the fly and automatically selecting the most optimal sampling
   locations. We introduce an autonomous exploration strategy driven by the
   quality of the soil moisture model indicating areas of the field where
   the information is less precise. The sensor model follows the Poisson
   distribution and we demonstrate how to integrate such measurements into
   the kriging framework. We also investigate a range of different
   exploration strategies and assess their usefulness through a set of
   evaluation experiments based on real soil moisture data collected from
   two different fields. We demonstrate the benefits of using the adaptive
   measurement interval and adaptive sampling strategies for building
   better quality soil moisture models. The presented method is general and
   can be applied to other scenarios where the measured phenomena directly
   affect the acquisition time and need to be spatially mapped.},

Title = {Remote Soil Moisture Measurement from Drone-Borne Reflectance
   Spectroscopy: Applications to Hydroperiod Measurement in Desert Playas},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The extent, timing, and magnitude of soil moisture in wetlands (the
   hydropattern) is a primary physical control on biogeochemical processes
   in desert environments. However, determining playa hydropatterns is
   challenged by the remoteness of desert basin sites and by the difficulty
   in determining soil moisture from remotely sensed data at fine spatial
   and temporal scales (hundreds of meters to kilometers, and hours to
   days). Therefore, we developed a new, reflectance-based soil moisture
   index (continuum-removed water index, or CRWI) that can be determined
   via hyperspectral imaging from drone-borne platforms. We compared its
   efficacy at remotely determining soil moisture content to existing
   hyperspectral and multispectral soil moisture indices. CRWI varies
   linearly with in situ soil moisture content (R-2 = 0.89, p < 0.001) and
   is comparatively insensitive to soil clay content (R-2 = 0.4, p = 0.01),
   soil salinity (R-2 = 0.82, p < 0.001), and soil grain size distribution
   (R-2 = 0.67, p < 0.001). CRWI is negatively correlated with clay
   content, indicating it is not sensitive to hydrated mineral absorption
   features. CRWI has stronger correlation with surface soil moisture than
   other hyperspectral and multispectral indices (R-2 = 0.69, p < 0.001 for
   WISOIL at this site). Drone-borne reflectance measurements allow
   monitoring of soil moisture conditions at the Alvord Desert playa test
   site over hectare-scale soil plots at measurement cadences of minutes to
   hours. CRWI measurements can be used to determine surface soil moisture
   at a range of desert sites to inform management decisions and to better
   reveal ecosystem processes in water-limited environments.},

Abstract = {In this article, we propose and demonstrate a novel corrosion-resistant,
   embeddable open-end coaxial cable soil moisture sensor. This microwave
   resonator is constructed using two reflectors along the coaxial line.
   The first reflector is a metal post at the signal input end,
   short-circuiting the inner conductor to the outer conductor. The second
   reflector comprises a welded metal plate parallel to the open end of the
   coaxial line, maintaining a fixed gap. A moisture-sensitive polyvinyl
   alcohol (PVA) film is inserted into this gap. The resonance frequency of
   the open-end coaxial cable resonator is highly dependent on the fringe
   capacitance, which varies with soil moisture levels. As such, tracking
   resonance frequency changes allows for correlation with soil moisture
   fluctuations. We provide a detailed discussion of the embeddable
   open-end microwave coaxial cable resonator (EOE-MCCR) mathematical model
   and a proof of concept for soil moisture measurement. The demonstration
   experiments investigate soil moisture content ranging from 4\% to 24\%.
   The prototype device exhibits a soil moisture measurement sensitivity of
   0.76 MHz/\% for soil moisture between 4\% and 10\% and 1.44 MHz/\% for
   soil moisture between 10\% and 24\%. The soil moisture sensor presented
   here is robust, easy to manufacture, chemically resistant, low-cost, and
   suitable for long-term applications and potential industrial uses. This
   innovative sensor is ideal for sensing applications in harsh
   environments, advancing the field of chemical trace sensing.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) datasets at high spatial resolutions are beneficial
   for a wide range of applications, such as monitoring and prediction of
   hydrological extremes, numerical weather prediction, and precision
   agriculture. For large scale applications in particular, remotely sensed
   SM has advantages over in situ data because it provides gridded
   estimates and because it is less labour-intensive. However, until
   present, active microwave SM data have not been presented at their
   native spatial resolution, since the quality of these data is limited by
   speckle. We explored the potential and limits of high spatial resolution
   of active microwave SM observations. We used a Sentinel-1 C-band SAR SM
   dataset at six spatial resolutions ranging from 20 x 20 to 120 x 120 m2.
   This was compared to a closely spaced (20 m) in situ dataset collected
   on a non-irrigated agricultural field (+/- 2.5 ha) in the Southeast of
   Luxembourg. A comparison of the field and satellite datasets
   demonstrated how Sentinel-1 data with a high spatial resolution can be
   used to quantify temporal within-field SM variability. SM was accurately
   estimated at spatial resolutions of 60 x 60 m2 and coarser, where the
   temporal correlation was found to be 0.67 and sub-field variations in SM
   were still detected. Spatial correlation was limited by the absence of
   SM variability within the field. These results indicate that high
   spatial resolution SM estimates from Sentinel-1 data can be valuable for
   monitoring temporal SM variations within agricultural fields.},

Title = {Modeling Soil Moisture Retrieval Errors in the Time-Series Ratio Method},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},
Abstract = {The use of a ``time-series ratio{''} soil moisture retrieval approach is
   under consideration for the upcoming NASA/ISRO synthetic aperture radar
   (NISAR) mission's soil moisture product. As such, it is of interest to
   characterize the algorithm's anticipated error budget as part of
   prelaunch activities. This letter develops an error model to estimate
   retrieval errors for the proposed algorithm. The model accounts for
   error contributions from speckle and thermal noise as well as
   uncertainties that arise as part of the retrieval process. Spatial and
   temporal behaviors of the retrieval errors are determined using a soil
   moisture active passive (SMAP)-based soil moisture climatology. The
   results show that soil moisture retrieval errors from the time-series

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important variable linking the atmosphere and
   terrestrial ecosystems. However, long-term satellite monitoring of
   surface soil moisture at the global scale needs improvement. In this
   study, we conducted data calibration and data fusion of 11
   well-acknowledged microwave remote-sensing soil moisture products since
   2003 through a neural network approach, with Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data applied as the primary training
   target. The training efficiency was high (R-2 = 0.95) due to the
   selection of nine quality impact factors of microwave soil moisture
   products and the complicated organizational structure of multiple neural
   networks (five rounds of iterative simulations, eight substeps, 67
   independent neural networks, and more than 1 million localized
   subnetworks). Then, we developed the global remote-sensing-based surface
   soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) covering 2003-2018 at 0.1 degrees
   resolution. The temporal resolution is approximately 10 d, meaning that
   three data records are obtained within a month, for days 1-10, 11-20,
   and from the 21st to the last day of that month. RSSSM is proven
   comparable to the in situ surface soil moisture measurements of the
   International Soil Moisture Network sites (overall R-2 and RMSE values
   of 0.42 and 0.087 m(3)m(-3)), while the overall R-2 and RMSE values for
   the existing popular similar products are usually within the ranges of
   0.31-0.41 and 0.095-0.142 m(3)m(-3)), respectively. RSSSM generally
   presents advantages over other products in arid and relatively cold
   areas, which is probably because of the difficulty in simulating the
   impacts of thawing and transient precipitation on soil moisture, and
   during the growing seasons. Moreover, the persistent high quality during
   2003-2018 as well as the complete spatial coverage ensure the
   applicability of RSSSM to studies on both the spatial and temporal
   patterns (e.g. long-term trend). RSSSM data suggest an increase in the
   global mean surface soil moisture. Moreover, without considering the
   deserts and rainforests, the surface soil moisture loss on consecutive
   rainless days is highest in summer over the low latitudes (30 degrees
   S-30 degrees N) but mostly in winter over the mid-latitudes (30-60
   degrees N, 30-60 degrees S). Notably, the error propagation is well
   controlled with the extension of the simulation period to the past,
   indicating that the data fusion algorithm proposed here will be more
   meaningful in the future when more advanced microwave sensors become
   operational. RSSSM data can be accessed at

Abstract = {Observed by satellites for more than a decade, surface soil moisture
   (SSM) is an essential component of the Earth system. Today, with the
   Sentinel missions, SSM can be derived at a sub-kilometer spatial
   resolution. In this work, aggregated 1 km x 1 km SSM observations
   combining Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) data are assimilated for
   the first time into the Interactions between Soil, Biosphere, and
   Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model using the global Land Data
   Assimilation System (LDAS-Monde) tool of Meteo-France. The ISBA
   simulations are driven by atmospheric variables from the Application of
   Research to Operations at Mesoscale (AROME) numerical weather prediction
   model for the period 2017-2019 for two regions in Southern France,
   Toulouse and Montpellier, and for the Salamanca region in Spain. The S1
   SSM shows a good agreement with in situ SSM observations. The S1 SSM is
   assimilated either alone or together with leaf area index (LAI)
   observations from the PROBA-V satellite. The assimilation of S1 SSM
   alone has a small impact on the simulated root zone soil moisture. On
   the other hand, a marked impact of the assimilation is observed over
   agricultural areas when LAI is assimilated, and the impact is larger
   when S1 SSM and LAI are assimilated together.},

   Phase Observations},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {7179-7197},
Abstract = {The soil moisture changes (Delta M-v) have a significant influence on
   forestry, hydrology, meteorology, agriculture, and climate change.
   Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), as a potential remote
   sensing tool for change detection, was relatively less investigated for
   monitoring this parameter. DInSAR phase (phi) is sensitive to the
   changes in soil moisture (M-v), and thus, can be potentially used for
   monitoring Delta M-v. In this article, the relations between phi and
   Delta M-v over wheat, canola, corn, soybean, weed, peas, and bare fields
   were investigated using an empirical regression technique. To this end,
   dual-polarimetric C-band Sentinel-1A and quad-polarimetric L-band
   uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) airborne
   datasets were employed. The regression model showed the coefficient of
   determination (R-2) of 40\% to 56\% and RMSE of 4.3 vol.\% to 6.1 vol.\%
   between the measured and estimated Delta M-v for different crop types
   when the temporal baseline (Delta T) was very short. As expected, higher
   accuracies were obtained using UAVSAR given its very short Delta T and
   its longer wavelength with R-2 of 47\% to 59\% and RMSE of 4.1 vol.\% to
   6.7 vol.\% for different crop types. However, using the Sentinel-1 data
   with the long Delta T and shorter wavelength (5.6 cm), the accuracies of
   Delta M-v estimations decreased significantly. The results of this study
   demonstrated that using the phi information from Sentinel-1 data is a
   promising approach for monitoring Delta M-v at an early growing season
   or before the crop starts growing, but using L-band SAR data and lower
   temporal baselines are recommended once the biomass increases.},

Title = {Applicability of the microdialysis technique in dry soils: Impact of
   soil water content depends on perfusion flow rate},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {177},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Plant nutrient acquisition largely depends on the availability and
   constant replenishment of nutrients at root surfaces. The main process
   providing nutrients for root uptake is diffusion which is critically
   affected by soil physicochemical and biological factors. The effective
   diffusion path length increases with decreasing soil water content thus
   limiting diffusive nutrient supply in dry soils. Microdialysis, an
   increasingly popular sampling tool for monitoring nutrient fluxes in
   soil in situ, could be used to measure such a limitation provided it
   operates reliably under dry soil conditions. However, due to its mode of
   operation, the performance of microdialysis could be impeded in dry
   soils since a significant amount of perfusate might be lost via leaching
   to the surrounding soil. Until now, however, no data is available on the
   applicability of microdialysis in dry soils. In this project, we
   estimated leaching losses of perfusate to eight soils with different
   texture maintained at 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80\% (w/w) of maximum
   water-holding capacity in dependence of perfusion flow rate. We found
   that microdialysis operates reliably even in dry soils when using a high
   perfusion flow rate (10 mu l min-1). At lower perfusion flow rates (1 or
   5 mu l min-1), however, significant amounts of perfusate were leaching
   out to soils. Diffusive fluxes of nitrate and ammonium were strongly
   affected by soil water content, but not fluxes of phosphate. Even at the
   highest flow rate (where no losses of perfusate where observed)
   concentrations of both inorganic N forms in dialysates decreased with
   decreasing soil water content. Overall, we conclude that microdialysis
   can be applied in dry soils without high risk of perfusate leaching when
   a high perfusion flow rate (10 mu l min-1) is used. Further, our results
   highlight that microdialysis can be used in much dryer soils than
   previously suggested (70\% MWHC) and allows monitoring the effect of
   soil water content on nutrient supply for root uptake via diffusion.},

   Wireless Underground Sensors},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {102107-102118},
Abstract = {With growing usage and demand for the global freshwater supply, there is
   an increasing need for technologies that facilitate water conservation
   and environmental stewardship in irrigated agriculture. Toward this end,
   recent demonstrations of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors have revealed
   the value of wireless soil moisture content sensors. However, existing
   wireless solutions often employ above-ground wireless communication
   modules that physically interfere with routine farming operations.
   Underground wireless network solutions are severely challenged by the
   large radio-frequency (RF) propagation loss through soil. This paper
   presents a method that overcomes both problems by employing completely
   buried underground IoT sensors and communication modules with UAS
   (uncrewed aircraft system) mounted LoRaWAN gateways. The UAS mounted
   LoRaWAN gateway eliminates the need for any in-field base stations and
   also allows the LoRa enabled sensors to transmit data over short
   distances with very low energy. Field tests were carried out using this
   approach to serve as a proof of concept. The RSSI (received signal
   strength indicator) demonstrates that the proposed solution has good
   communication link margin and a significantly larger communication range
   than is necessary for reliable operation. Moreover, this solution is
   easy to build, scalable, cost-effective, and can be implemented in a
   highly power efficient fashion.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an essential parameter for understanding the
   interactions and feedbacks between the atmosphere and the Earth's
   surface through energy and water cycles. Knowledge of the spatiotemporal
   distribution of land surface SM has long been a challenge in the remote

   the optical/thermal to the microwave regions, have been intensively
   investigated for SM retrieval, providing a number of algorithms, models

   However, certain issues with respect to retrieval accuracy,
   spatiotemporal resolution, and data consistency exist and remain
   unsolved between the state-of-the-art of SM retrieval and readily-used
   SM datasets for various domains at field, regional/watershed or global
   scales. In particular, several new theories and algorithms for SM
   retrieval proposed in recent years have not been well documented in
   previous articles. Therefore, a critical review of the established and
   emerging SM retrieval methods with respect to their advantages and
   disadvantages is necessary. In present study, future directions for each

Abstract = {The primary objective of this work was the utilization of the pulsed
   acoustic wave (PAW) method to explore the feasibility of measuring soil
   water content (SWC) based on the soil acoustic parameter acquisition
   (SAPA) system. Acoustic parameters (pulse acoustic velocity and acoustic
   attenuation coefficient) were collected from paddy soil (clay), red soil
   (loam), and lateritic-red soil (clay loam) under different SWCs. The
   calibration models of the pulse acoustic velocity, the attenuation
   coefficient, and the double acoustic parameters with the soil volumetric
   water content (SVWC) were established through fitting analysis. We
   studied the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration models
   and conducted an extensive field experiment for 40 days to evaluate the
   calibration model's ability to predict SVWC. The results showed that the
   repeatability and reproducibility of the SVWC calibration model based on
   pulse acoustic velocity were the best, which showed that the acoustic
   velocity was more suitable for the inversion of SVWC than the acoustic
   attenuation coefficient. The 40-day field study's experimental results
   also verified the potential value of pulse acoustic velocity in SVWC
   detection.},

Abstract = {Drought-induced evaporation can reduce soil water content and
   significantly alter soil hydro-mechanical behavior. Understanding the
   temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of soil water content
   during evaporation is of great significance for evaluating the
   encountered geotechnical and geo-environmental problems in arid or
   semi-arid regions. In this study, an electrical resistivity/resistance
   method (ERM) with a high spatial resolution of centimeter-level was
   developed for a small-scale laboratory test and applied to
   quantitatively characterize the evaporation-induced water content
   variations along a depth gradient. A total of 8 groups of initially
   saturated sandy soil columns (84 mm in diameter and 290 mm in height)
   were prepared, and eight pairs of mini electrodes (3.5 mm in diameter)
   were installed in each soil sample with a vertical distance of 30 mm.
   The soil columns were subjected to continuous drying. The changes in
   soil electrical resistance at different depths were monitored by the
   electrode couples. The gravimetric water contents at different depths
   were also measured at the end of drying. It is found that soil water
   content decreases exponentially with increasing electrical resistance.
   Based on the obtained data, a calibration relationship between soil
   gravimetric water content and corrected electrical resistance was well
   established with consideration of temperature effect. This relationship
   was validated successfully by the experimental results, indicating the
   feasibility of the developed ERM to characterize the soil water content
   dynamics during the drying process. Besides, the drying process with the
   movement of the evaporation front was discussed. The results of this
   study demonstrate the good performance of ERM in the estimation of
   temporal and spatial variations of soil water content and its potential
   application in arid or semi-arid regions with frequent droughts.},

   with Satellite Images},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The water cycle around the globe is significantly impacted by the
   moisture in the soil. However, finding a quick and practical model to
   cope with the enormous amount of data is a difficult issue for remote
   sensing practitioners. The traditional methods of measuring soil
   moisture are inefficient at large sizes, which can be replaced by remote
   sensing techniques for obtaining soil moisture. While determining the
   soil moisture, the low return frequency of satellites and the lack of
   images pose a severe challenge to the current remote sensing techniques.
   Therefore, this paper suggested a novel technique for Soil Moisture
   Retrieval. In the initial phase, image acquisition is made. Then, VI
   indexes (NDVI, GLAI, Green NDVI (GNDVI), and WDRVI features) are
   derived. Further, an improved Water Cloud Model (WCM) is deployed as a
   vegetation impact rectification scheme. Finally, soil moisture retrieval
   is determined by the hybrid model combining Deep Max Out Network (DMN)
   and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) schemes, whose outputs
   are then passed on to enhanced score level fusion that offers final
   results. According to the results, the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier
   (Bi-GRU and DMN) method was lower (0.9565) than the RMSE of the Hybrid
   Classifier methods. The ME values of the HC (Bi-GRU and DMN) were also
   lower (0.728697) than those of the HC methods without the vegetation
   index, the HC methods without the presence of water clouds, and the HC
   methods with traditional water clouds. In comparison to HC (Bi-GRU and
   DMN), the HC method without vegetation index has a lower error of 0.8219
   than the HC method with standard water cloud and the HC method without
   water cloud.},

Abstract = {We assess the validity of the surface moisture availability parameter
   (M-o) derived from satellite-based optical/thermal measurements using
   the simplified triangle method. First, we show that M-o values obtained
   from the simplified triangle method agree closely with those generated
   from a soil/vegetation/atmosphere/transfer (SVAT) model for scenes over
   a field site at the Allahabad district, India. Next, we compared M-o
   values from the simplified triangle method for these same overpass
   scenes with surface soil water content measured at depths of 5 and 15 cm
   at this field site. Although a very weak correlation exists between
   remotely sensed values of M-o for the full scenes and measured soil
   water content measured at both depths, correlations increasingly improve
   for the 5 cm samples (but not for the 15 cm samples) as pixels were
   limited to increasingly smaller vegetation fractions. We conclude that
   the simplified triangle method would yield reasonable values of M-o and
   demonstrate good agreement with ground measurements, provided that
   validation is limited to pixels with little or no vegetation and to soil
   depths of 5 cm or less.},

Title = {A New Method for Estimating Irrigation Water Use via Soil Moisture},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The ability to obtain an accurate measure of irrigation water use is
   urgently needed in order to provide further scientific guidance for
   irrigation practices. This investigation took soil moisture and
   precipitation as the study objects and quantitatively analyzed their
   relationship by establishing four models: a linear model, a logarithmic
   model, a soil water balance model, and a similarity model. The results
   from building models on every site clearly revealed the relationship
   between soil moisture and precipitation and confirmed the feasibility of
   estimating irrigation water use when soil moisture data are known. Four
   models combined with soil moisture data were used to estimate irrigation
   water use. First, the 16 sites which monitor soil moisture conditions in
   Hebi City were identified as study objects, from which everyday
   meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure,
   wind speed, sunshine duration) and soil moisture data from 2015 to 2020
   (totaling six years) were collected. Second, the eligible data from the
   first four years in the date range were used to create four kinds of
   models (linear model, logarithmic model, soil water balance model, and
   similarity model) to estimate the amount of water input to the soil
   surface based on soil moisture. Third, the eligible data from the last
   two years in the established date range were used to verify the
   established models on every site and then judge the accuracy of the
   models. For example, for site 53990, the RMSE of the linear model,
   logarithmic model, soil water balance model, and similarity model was
   10,547, 10,302, 8619, and 7524, respectively. The results demonstrate
   that the similarity model proposed in this study can express the
   quantitative relationship between soil moisture and precipitation more
   accurately than the other three models. Based on this conclusion, the
   eligible soil moisture data known in the specific site were ultimately
   used to estimate the irrigation water use in the field by the
   relationship expressed in the similarity model. Compared with the amount
   of irrigation water data recorded, the estimated irrigation water use
   yielded by the similarity model in this study was 18.11\% smaller. In a
   future study, microwave satellite remote sensing of soil moisture data,
   such as SMAP and SMOS soil moisture data, will be used to evaluate the
   performance of estimated regional irrigation water use.},

Title = {Improving SMAP soil moisture spatial resolution in different climatic
   conditions using remote sensing data},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {195},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at the interface between the land surface and
   atmosphere is one of the major environmental parameters which plays an
   important role in hydrological applications. In this article, the SM
   measured by Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is downscaled from 3- to
   1-km spatial resolution. The main purpose is to evaluate the performance
   of two different downscaling methods over a variety of climatic
   conditions and land cover types. These two methods, based on regression
   and artificial neural network (ANN), are used for enabling us to
   cross-validate and reliably interpret the obtained results since the
   number of ground measurements is not sufficient for accuracy assessment.
   These methods are applied over four different case studies; one is
   located in the USA, i.e., state of Utah (semi-arid), and the remaining
   three are located in Iran, i.e., Fars (arid and semi-arid), Yazd
   (hyper-arid), and Golestan (humid). In both methods, different
   combinations of input features correlated with SM including land surface
   temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI),
   brightness temperatures in horizontal and vertical polarizations (TBH
   and TBV), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and digital elevation model (DEM)
   are used. It is found that the DEM does not add extra information in
   downscaling. The reason is due to high correlation between topography
   and LST. Moreover, SWIR is most likely able to model only large-scale
   variations of SM. The downscaled SM products are then compared to 1-km
   resolution SMAP SM extracted from Sentinel-1 for the study areas in Iran
   and in situ measurements in Utah. Both methods produce results which are
   considerably consistent except that the regression method adds more
   spatial details in the downscaled SM. The achievements illustrate that
   the performance of both downscaling methods is higher in areas with more
   homogeneous climatic conditions, i.e., Yazd and Golestan. The best
   evaluation metrics including correlation coefficient (R), root mean
   square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for Yazd
   and Golestan are R = 0.89, RMSE = 0.025 m3/m3, and MAPE = 21.13\% and R
   = 0.93, RMSE = 0.044 m3/m3, and MAPE = 21.95\%, respectively. Moreover,
   large model biases are associated with dense vegetated areas and high
   altitudes. The best downscaling accuracy in both methods over all study
   areas belongs to bare soil and flat regions.},

Abstract = {Actively heated fiber-optic distributed temperature sensing (aFO-DTS)
   measures soil moisture content at sub-meter intervals across kilometres
   of fiber-optic cable. The technology has great potential for
   environmental monitoring but calibration at field scales with variable
   soil conditions is challenging. To better understand and quantify the
   errors associated with aFO-DTS soil moisture measurements, we use a
   parametric numerical modeling approach to evaluate different error
   factors for uniform soil. A thermo-hydrogeologic, unsaturated numerical
   model is used to simulate a 0.01 m by 0.01 m two-dimensional domain,
   including soil and a fiber-optic cable. Results from the model are
   compared to soil moisture values calculated using the commonly used
   T-cum calibration method for aFO-DTS. The model is found to have high
   accuracy between measured and observed saturations for static hydrologic
   conditions but shows discrepancies for more realistic settings with
   active recharge. We evaluate the performance of aFO-DTS soil moisture
   calculations for various scenarios, including varying recharge duration
   and heterogeneous soils. The aFO-DTS accuracy decreases as the
   variability in soil properties and intensity of recharge events
   increases. Further, we show that the burial of the fiber-optic cable
   within soil may adversely affect calculated results. The results
   demonstrate the need for careful selection of calibration data for this
   emerging method of measuring soil moisture content.},

Abstract = {Signals of opportunity (SoOp) reflectometry (SoOp-R) is a maturing field
   for geophysical remote sensing as evidenced by the growing number of
   airborne and spaceborne experiments. As this approach receives more
   attention, it is worth analyzing SoOp-R's capabilities to retrieve
   subsurface soil moisture (SM) by leveraging communication and navigation
   satellite transmitters. In this research, the Cramer-Rao lower bound
   (CRLB) is used to identify the effects of variable SoOp-R parameters on
   the best achievable estimation error for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM).
   This study investigates the use of multiple frequency, polarization, and
   incidence angle measurement configurations on a two-layered dielectric
   profile. The results also detail the effects of variable SM conditions
   on the capability of SoOp-R systems to predict subsurface SM. The most
   prevalent observation is the importance of using at least two
   frequencies to limit uncertainties from subsurface SM estimates. If at
   least two frequencies are used, the CRLB of a profile is retrievable
   within the root-zone depending on the surface SM content as well as the
   number of independent measurements of the profile. For a depth of 30 cm,
   it is observed that a CRLB corresponding to 4\% RZSM estimation accuracy
   is achievable with as few as two dual-frequency-based SoOp-R
   measurements. For this depth, increasing number of measurements provided
   by polarization and incidence angle allow for sensing of increasingly
   wet SM profile structures. This study, overall, details a methodology by
   which SoOp-R receiver system can be designed to achieve a desired CRLB
   using a tradeoff study between the available measurements and SM
   profile.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a direct source of water for terrestrial plants.
   Measurement of soil moisture can help to characterize plant growth and

   to retrieve the soil moisture in the study area. The results show that
   the three indices of ATI, SWCI and VSWI have good correlation with soil
   moisture, among which VSWI has the best fitting effect, and ATI and SWCI
   can retrieve soil moisture more effectively. The soil moisture contents
   are mostly concentrated in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 m(3)/m(3), among
   which the soil moisture of Jianshui County, Mengzi City, Wenshan County,
   Yanshan County, Gejiu City and Shiping County are the smallest, and the
   soil moisture in the western portion of Gengma County and Cangyuan
   County and the central portion of Jinggu County are the largest. As the

Abstract = {Small scale laboratory testing was conducted to estimate the moisture
   content of sandy soils using a non-destructive and non-contact infrared
   thermography (IRT) technique. Tests were carried out by applying an
   external halogen lamp light (400 W). In this study, the aim was to
   explore the feasibility of using IRT to assess the moisture content of
   sandy soil. The laboratory tests conducted included evaluating soil
   physical characteristics such as grain size distribution. Soil samples
   were prepared with five different moisture content percentages. The soil
   moisture content was then evaluated using two different techniques. The
   first is the gravimetric oven dry method as per (ASTM D2216, 2019). The
   second is the IRT Technique. During the second procedure the samples
   were photographed with an ICI IR-Pad 640 P Series camera, which had an
   image resolution of 640 x 480 pixels and a capture rate of 6
   frames/minute. The emissivity correction used was 0.98. The soil surface
   temperature was captured in both the heating and the cooling phase, with
   the temperature taken from a specific thermal image area called the
   region of interest (ROI). Moisture content measurements were taken for
   each sample using the oven-drying method at the initial stage, and at
   the end of the heating and cooling phases. The procedure produced a good
   correlation between moisture content and surface temperature in the
   heating phase. The soil moisture content and surface temperatures were
   inversely related and formed a linear line with a high degree of
   accuracy (r2 1/4 0.9138). A validation check is done at the end for a
   sample with random moisture content using the IRT technique where the
   moisture content was found to be 6.81\%, this value was confirmed with
   the oven dry procedure. It was found that IRT successfully estimated
   soil moisture content.},

Abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System Pseudo Interference Reflectometry
   (GNSS-PIR) is proposed for ground-based soil moisture remote sensing in
   this letter. It combines the signal received by the up-looking
   right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) antenna with that received by the
   down-looking left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) antenna to form an
   oscillatory carrier to noise ratio (CNR) waveform. The analyses of
   waveform quality and parameters' sensitivities to soil moisture in
   comparison with GNSS Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) indicate
   that both the amplitude and the phase of GNSS-PIR waveform at high
   elevation angles are available for soil moisture determination. Soil
   moisture inversion based on Monte Carlo simulations shows that GNSS-PIR
   obtains better inversion accuracy than GNSS-IR.},

Abstract = {In this article, we fabricated three electrode electrochemical sensor
   for the detection of potassium (K+) in the soil. Since potassium in the
   soil directly impacts on the growth of the plants, it is necessary to
   detect the potassium. To achieve this, the low-cost polyethylene
   terephthalate (PET) paper-based potassium sensor has been designed and
   fabricated by using the screen-printing technique. With the proposed
   fabrication setup, we have fabricated 63 sensors on A4 size PET sheet.
   The three electrodes in the sensor are counter electrode (CE), working
   electrode (WE), and the reference electrode (RE), which are analyzed by
   using the cyclic voltammetry (CV). The fundamental principle of this
   sensor is based on the ion sensitive membrane (ISM) used on the WE.
   Therefore, the valinomycin is used as the ISM for sensing the K+ ions.
   It has also been observed that the selectivity and the sensitivity of
   the proposed sensor are significantly higher in comparison to the
   reported valinomycin-based sensors. Since the proposed sensor uses the
   paper-based approach, the cost of each fabricated sensor is around \$
   0.06 ((sic)5).},

   Soil Moisture Using a Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse Distributed Temperature
   Sensing Approach},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Increasing interest in studying the variability of soil water content
   and its spatial scale dependency necessitates the development of new
   techniques to accurately monitor soil water over a wide range of spatial
   scales. Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer
   unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial
   resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be
   used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that
   investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the
   Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to
   measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field
   experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field
   laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed
   from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements
   and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their
   construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken
   over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was
   compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was
   able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02
   m(3) m(-3) using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the
   tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations
   typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this
   study provide some practical information and measures that need to be
   taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Here, the arrangement of litterfall and nutrient return to the soil by
   the seven-year-old plantations of Eucalyptus under different spacings
   established on sodic wastelands in northern India was determined. The
   litterfall was sorted into leaf wood and miscellaneous. Further, the
   seasonal variation of litterfall obtained under three different spacings
   was recorded. Maximum leaf litter production was observed in 3x3 m
   spacing followed by 6x1.5 m during the winter season. Whereas, the
   minimum leaf litter was recorded in 17x1x1 m spacing. Similarly, the
   maximum wood litter production was observed at the spacing of 3x3 m
   spacing in rainy season followed by 6x1.5 m.The weights of nutrients
   returned through annual litterfall in 3x3 spacing returned the highest
   amount of N (2.16 g/m(2) year) followed by 6x1.5 and 17x1x1 spacing..
   Whereas, two-year data of litterfall of E. tereticornis showed the
   17x1x1 spacing returned the highest amount of P in next year through
   leaf litter followed by 6x1.5 and minimum 3x3 spacing. Overall, this

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {This study presents an analysis of daily field-scale soil-moisture (SM)
   variations, measured using the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System
   (COSMOS), over a tropical monsoon site (IITM, Pune) in India, for the
   period 2017-2020. Being located in the core zone of the Indian summer
   monsoon, the daily field-scale SM observations at COSMOS-IITM provide an
   unique opportunity to understand the SM response to monsoon
   precipitation variations on sub-seasonal, seasonal and interannual
   time-scales. In addition to the COSMOS-IITM observations, we also
   evaluated SM variations over this location using satellite, reanalysis
   and model products for the same period. An important result from our
   analysis reveals the presence of biweekly (time-scale similar to 10-20
   days) and low-frequency intra-seasonal (time-scale similar to 30-60
   days) variations in the field-scale SM, which are linked to the dominant
   modes of Indian summer monsoon subseasonal variability. In particular,
   we find a pronounced enhancement of the low-frequency signal of SM
   variations during the 2019 monsoon which was characterized by abnormally
   excess precipitation and prolongation of rains well beyond the summer
   monsoon season, in contrast to 2018 monsoon. Moreover, this study
   highlights a longer persistence of SM memory time-scale (about 60 days)
   during 2019 as compared to 2017, 2018 and 2020. The validation of
   coarser resolution data sets revealed that GLDAS and ERA5 reasonably
   capture a range of observed field-scale SM variabilities over

   Soil Moisture (MSSM) Product},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This study develops a triple-collocation (TC) based, multi-source
   shallow-soil moisture product for Oklahoma. The method uses a least
   squared weights (LSW) optimization to find the set of parameters that
   result in the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) with respect to the
   ``unknown truth{''}. Soil moisture information from multiple sources and
   resolutions, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive SMAP
   L3\_SM\_P\_E (9 km, daily), the physically-based, land surface model
   (LSM) estimates from NLDAS\_NOAH0125\_H (1/8 \& DEG;, hourly), and the
   Oklahoma Mesonet ground sensor network (9 km interpolated from point, 30
   min) is merged into a 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution product
   across the state of Oklahoma from April 2015 to July 2019. This
   multi-sensor surface soil moisture (MSSM) product is assessed in terms
   of a state-wide benchmark and previously tested, in situ-based soil
   moisture product and SMAP L4. Results show that: (1) independent source
   products have differential values according to the regional conditions
   they represent, including land cover type, soils, irrigation, or climate
   regime; (2) beyond serving as validation sets, in situ measurements are
   of significant value for improving the accuracy of multi-sensor soil
   moisture datasets through TC; and (3) state-wide RMSE values obtained
   with MSSM are similar to the typical measurement error found on in situ
   ground measurements which provides some degree of confidence on the new
   product. MSSM is an improvement over currently available products in
   Oklahoma due to its minimized uncertainty, easiness of production, and
   continuous temporal and geographic coverage. Nevertheless, to exploit
   its utility, further tests of this methodology are needed in different
   climates, land cover types, geographic regions, and for other
   independent products and spatiotemporal resolutions.},

Title = {Versatile simplistic correction of T-higrow sensors for improved soil
   moisture measurement accuracy},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {35},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation can help reduce water
   and energy consumption and risks of groundwater contamination, which are
   essential aspects for pursuing sustainable development goals. However,
   increased adoption of this technology is limited by calibration
   requirements, technical complexities, and sensor costs. In this work, a
   simplified method for reducing the measurement error of a recently
   released low-cost soil sensor (T-Higrow) is presented. The method only
   requires measurements of a dry sample from the target soil, which are
   inputted into a simple correction formula to reduce the measurement
   error at higher moisture levels. The requirements of the proposed method
   are simple enough for most labs or extension services. This method was
   compared to the commonly used linear, polynomial, and logarithmic
   regression models based on repeated bench-scale experiments within
   0\%-35\% moisture range in silt and sandy loam soils and in silica sand.
   Uncorrected sensor readings correlated well with soil moisture (r:
   0.94-0.98), but with significant overestimation (25\%-60\% error). The
   simplified correction method showed comparable error reduction to
   regression models across all soil types. All methods reduced error down
   to 2\%-10\% (0.02-0.1 cm(3) cm(-3)) and maintained high correlations (r
   > 0.94), except for logarithmic regression which reduced correlation by
   around 3\%. Variability amongst sensor measurements was generally low
   (Standard Deviation: 0.01-0.03) particularly at moisture ranges below
   20\%, this was also the case for sensor-to-sensor variability (Standard
   Deviation: 0.01-0.03). Sensor evaluation and calibration works are
   needed to increase the accessibility to this technology for improved
   water and energy conservation.},

   The system consists of sensor networks like, soil moisture, temperature
   and rainfall. With the use of battery, we will make the sensor to get
   activated. The soil moisture, temperature and rainfall are not necessary
   to be used for all the time. When these sensors are used in agriculture
   we can save time and energy. For every 15 minutes the soil moisture will
   be tested before the crop is cultivated and the results will be sent to
   the main server. In those remaining times, these sensors will be in
   SLEEP/SHUT DOWN STATE. This method helps us to save energy and time.

Title = {Multi-Frame Fringing Field Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor With Enhanced
   Sensitivity and Penetration Depth},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {73},
Abstract = {Recently, 2-frame interdigital fringe-field (ID-FF)-based capacitive
   sensors have been widely employed for soil moisture measurement. The
   present challenge with this design is to achieve both penetration depth
   and sensitivity simultaneously. In this work, keeping the electrode
   contour area fixed, multi-frame ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensors
   are proposed and designed to enhance sensitivity and penetration depth,
   simultaneously. A theoretical model for capacitance is extended to a
   multi-frame configuration. The estimated capacitance from this extended
   theoretical model is compared against simulation results and found to be
   well-correlated. Multi-frame ID-FF configurations with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8,
   and 9 frames are used to develop single-sided (s-s) and dual-sided (d-s)
   ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensor models. Simulation results show an
   increase in the sensitivity and penetration depth with reference to the
   generic 2-frame ID-FF capacitive sensor configuration. The models with
   distinct multi-frame configurations and an associated
   signal-conditioning circuit are also fabricated. Experiments for
   sensitivity indicate an average error of less than 6\% with reference to
   simulation, which is lower than that reported in the recent literature.
   One of the fabricated sensors is calibrated using the thermogravimetric
   method. The performance of the fabricated sensors is then compared with
   a standard commercial sensor with respect to the thermogravimetric
   method and is found to meet the expected requirements with a correlation
   coefficient of 0.997.},

Abstract = {The physical properties of soil, such as structure and texture, can
   affect the performance of an electromagnetic sensor in measuring soil
   water content. Historically, calibrations have been performed on
   repacked samples in the laboratory and on in situ soils in the field,
   but little research has been done on laboratory calibrations with intact
   (undisturbed) soil cores. In this study, three replications each of
   disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from two soil
   texture classes (Yutan silty clay loam and Fillmore silt loam) at a
   field site in eastern Nebraska to investigate the effects of soil
   structure and texture on the precision of a METER Group GS-1
   capacitance-based sensor calibration. In addition, GS-1 sensors were
   installed in the field near the soil collection sites at three depths
   (0.15, 0.46, and 0.76 m). The soil moisture sensor had higher precision
   in the undisturbed laboratory setup, as the undisturbed calibration had
   a better correlation {[}slope closer to one, R-undisturbed(2) (0.89) >
   R-disturbed(2) (0.73)] than the disturbed calibrations for the Yutan and
   Fillmore texture classes, and the root mean square difference using the
   laboratory calibration (RMSDL) was higher for pooled disturbed samples
   (0.053 m(3) m(3)(-)) in comparison to pooled undisturbed samples (0.023
   m(3) m(-3)). The uncertainty in determination of volumetric water
   content (8) was higher using the factory calibration (RVISDF) in
   comparison to the laboratory calibration (RVISDL) for the different soil
   structures and texture classes. In general, the uncertainty in
   estimation of soil water depth was greater than the uncertainty in
   estimation of soil water depletion by the sensors installed in the
   field, and the uncertainties in estimation of depth and depletion were
   lower using the calibration developedfrom the undisturbed soil samples.
   The undisturbed calibration of soil water depletion would determine
   water demand with better precision and potentially avoid over-watering,
   offering relief from water shortages. Further investigation of sensor
   calibration techniques is required to enhance the applicability of soil
   moisture sensors for efficient irrigation management.},

Journal = {SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {365},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {In this work, an MoS2 nanosheet based ultrasensitive humidity and soil
   moisture sensor has been developed. MoS2 nanosheets are obtained by
   sonication based surfactant-induced exfoliation. The performance of the
   sensor is examined at room temperature (25 ?) with respect to various
   relative humidity (RH) levels and soil water content (theta g). A 434
   fold variation (35-15200 pF) in capacitance value is seen when the
   relative humidity level changes from 11\% to 96\%. The response and
   recovery times of the microsensor are approximately 30 s and 40 s,
   respectively. The capacitance of the MoS2 based sensor increases
   monotonically when the soil moisture content increases from 3.6\% to
   53\% and 2.3-45\% for black and red soil, respectively. The observed
   variation in capacitance corresponding to theta gB = 53\% (black soil
   moisture content) and theta(gR) = 45\% (red soil moisture content) is
   approximately 250 and 200 times that observed for the respective dry
   soil samples. The error in the soil moisture response measurement for
   the temperature variation from 25 ? to 70 ? is +/- 2.52\%. The device
   features stable performance for six months with reasonably high accuracy
   (maximum error \& PLUSMN; 1.50\%). The soil sensing results show fast
   response (35 s), negligible hysteresis error (2.80\% at theta(gB) =
   31.9\%), long-term stability (6 months and more), and good
   reproducibility (with more than 10 cycles).},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an essential variable both in environmental monitoring
   research and application. With the requirement of high-precision soil
   moisture data, it is highly necessary to construct in-situ soil moisture
   sensors Web in high density, in which the economics, complexity, and
   low-power consumption of sensor Webs should be essentially considered.
   However, most current existing soil moisture monitoring networks have
   limitations due to high power consumption, complex architecture, and
   expensive equipment. These issues are not conducive to high-density soil
   moisture observation. In view of the existing problems in the current
   soil moisture in-situ sites, an effective resolution for high-density
   soil moisture observation is needed. For the first time, we are bringing
   Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT), a low-power Internet-of-Things
   technology, into geospatial sensor Web for soil moisture observation.
   Moreover, we built a high-density in-situ soil moisture sensor Web via
   NB-IoT and compared it with ZigBee at the Baoxie experimental zone in
   Wuhan, China, there about 1 km(2), and we acquired data for up to 12
   months. We analyze the acquisition record of battery status, signals,
   and soil moisture. We analyzed the battery life, the impact of the
   signal on the battery performance, the signal quality, and data
   acquisition clearly and intuitively. This unprecedented study and
   application, we discovered and concluded that the low-power sensor Web
   of the NB-IoT communication protocol could be suitable for high-density
   soil moisture observation.},

Title = {Soil Moisture-Vegetation-Carbon Flux Relationship under Agricultural
   Drought Condition using Optical Multispectral Sensor},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Agricultural drought is triggered by a depletion of moisture content in
   the soil, which hinders photosynthesis and thus increases carbon dioxide
   (CO2) concentrations in the atmosphere. The aim of this study is to
   analyze the relationship between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation
   activity toward quantifying CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. To this
   end, the MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), an
   optical multispectral sensor, was used to evaluate two regions in South
   Korea for validation. Vegetation activity was analyzed through MOD13A1
   vegetation indices products, and MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP)
   product was used to calculate the CO2 flux based on its relationship
   with respiration. In the case of SM, it was calculated through the
   method of applying apparent thermal inertia (ATI) in combination with
   land surface temperature and albedo. To validate the SM and CO2 flux,
   flux tower data was used which are the observed measurement values for
   the extreme drought period of 2014 and 2015 in South Korea. These two
   variables were analyzed for temporal variation on flux tower data as
   daily time scale, and the relationship with vegetation index (VI) was
   synthesized and analyzed on a monthly scale. The highest correlation
   between SM and VI (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.82) was observed at a
   time lag of one month, and that between VI and CO2 (r = 0.81) at half
   month. This regional study suggests a potential capability of
   MODIS-based SM, VI, and CO2 flux, which can be applied to an assessment
   of the global view of the agricultural drought by using available
   satellite remote sensing products.},

Abstract = {Agriculture faces several challenges to use the available resources in a
   more environmentally sustainable manner. One of the most significant is
   to develop sustainable water management. The modern Internet of Things
   (IoT) techniques with real-time data collection and visualisation can
   play an important role in monitoring the readily available moisture in
   the soil. An automated Arduino-based low-cost capacitive soil moisture
   sensor has been calibrated and developed for data acquisition. A sensor-
   and soil-specific calibration was performed for the soil moisture
   sensors (SKU:SEN0193 - DFROBOT, Shanghai, China). A Repeatability and
   Reproducibility study was conducted by range of mean methods on clay
   loam, sandy loam and silt loam soil textures. The calibration process
   was based on the data provided by the capacitive sensors and the
   continuously and parallelly measured soil moisture content by the
   thermogravimetric method. It can be stated that the response of the
   sensors to changes in soil moisture differs from each other, which was
   also greatly influenced by different soil textures. Therefore, the
   calibration according to soil texture was required to ensure adequate
   measurement accuracy. After the calibration, it was found that a
   polynomial calibration function (R-2 >= 0.89) was the most appropriate
   way for modelling the behaviour of the sensors at different soil
   textures.},

Abstract = {The measurement of soil moisture and air humidity is essential to many
   technological and environmental applications. Sensors provide
   information that is useful in order to effectively manage and control
   various processes. This study presents an energy-efficient, highly
   reliable, ultra-high frequency (UHF) capacitive sensor that can measure
   moisture/humidity, and liquid levels. As a sensitive part, an
   interdigital capacitor (IDC) is fed via a coplanar waveguide (CPW) for
   efficient power transfer. Aside from the sensitive part of the IDC, the
   structure of the sensor is insensitive to variations in surrounding
   permittivity, which reduces uncertainty in results and thus improves
   accuracy. The principle of sensing is based on a reactive phase
   variation of the input signal upon reflection, whereas its amplitude and
   phase are actively changing with variations in the dielectric constant
   of the test medium. Practical testing was conducted on the sensor to
   determine soil moisture, air humidity, and liquid level measurement. At
   a fixed UHF frequency of 915 MHz the sensor offers a capacitive
   sensitivity of 7.5 fF/\%WC, 4.5 fF/\%RH, and 13.4 fF/mm for soil
   moisture, air humidity, and water level detection respectively. This new
   sensor provides high reliability, good sensitivity, low power
   consumption, and can be implemented in a number of applications,
   including agriculture, oil, and gas industry, land and water treatment,
   medical equipment, and biotechnology.},

Abstract = {Over-irrigation without considering the soil property reduce the product
   yield and variety in many agricultural areas. In this study, it is aimed
   to produce a more useful, and user-friendly 3D soil moisture detection
   system by using wireless communication across the agricultural areas.
   The deficiencies of agricultural land can be eliminated in terms of
   irrigation, product variety, and product yield. 3D moisture information
   obtained from the soil can be transferred to a database system and the
   farmers can use this system to cultivate across the correct fields. A
   capacitive soil moisture sensor is deployed as a sensor unit. Each
   sensor unit with its electronics is placed in a PVC pipe with a specific
   length. This PVC pipe is placed vertically in the soil with sensor
   electrodes contacting the soil. Moisture measurements are carried out
   across the agricultural area. The system provides 3D moisture maps of
   the soil at fixed depths. Each 3D map represents a subsurface moisture
   layer. The sensor units are calibrated by measuring the moisture in the
   water, corresponding to \%100 moisture in the soil, and the moisture in
   dry air, corresponding to \%0 moisture in the soil. A percentage
   moisture determination formula is developed between these two extreme
   levels for each sensor unit. Hence the benefit of the results will be
   the knowledge of \% moisture values in-depth profile of the agricultural
   areas. Farmers will have comprehensive and real-time information about
   moisture data and this data will help them to grow better crops.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL MODELLING \& SOFTWARE},

Abstract = {Green infrastructure (GI) is cost-effective for managing urban runoff.
   However, inspection and maintenance of GI are an increasingly common
   burden for stormwater managers. For instance, bioretention cells, a
   popular type of GI, may clog, sometimes unexpectedly, and detection can
   be challenging due to their dispersed place-ment. Current inspection
   programs nationwide largely rely on time-intensive, manual, qualitative
   inspections. This study develops an approach for real-time monitoring
   and prediction of column performance. First, we conduct laboratory
   experiments to continuously collect soil moisture data using sensors at
   two different depths in bioretention column testbeds. Four design
   configurations are used that allow the water to drain differently
   through the column, hence acting as different environmental climates.
   Next, we develop machine learning models, i.e., long short-term memory
   (LSTM) models, to accurately predict current and future soil moisture
   levels. Our results suggest that the quality of predictions is overall
   high, but they vary across the configurations.},

Abstract = {Precision irrigation is essential to improve water use efficiency (WUE),
   defined as the amount of biomass produced per unit of water used by
   plants. Our objective is to evaluate the effect of different soil
   volumetric water content (VWC) in plant growth, fruit yield, quality,
   and WUE of cherry tomatoes grown in a greenhouse. We tested four VWC
   thresholds (0.23, 0.30, 0.37, and 0.44 m(3) m(-3)) to trigger a drip
   irrigation system in two tomato cultivars ('Sweet Heaven' and `Mascot
   F1'). The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four
   replications. We used capacitance sensors connected to an open-source,
   low-cost platform to monitor and control the irrigation in real-time
   based on demand. Plants were watered every time the soil VWC dropped
   below the set thresholds. The treatment with VWC 0.44 m(3) m(-3)
   resulted in the highest fruit yield, with 102.10\% higher WUE when
   compared to the VWC 0.23 m(3) m(-3) in both cultivars. Fruit quality
   traits such as longitudinal and equatorial diameter increased
   asymptotically with soil water content. In contrast, treatments with
   deficit irrigation increased the fruit soluble solids by 15.73\% in both
   cultivars. These results strongly suggest that accurate control of the
   soil VWC is essential to modulate the fruit yield and quality attributes
   in tomatoes produced in the greenhouse.},

Abstract = {The development of in-situ soil moisture sensors (SMS) with advanced
   materials is the requirement of the future autonomous agriculture
   industry. However, an open challenge for these sensors is to control
   changes in the capacitance rather than resistance while attaining
   reliability, high performance, scalability and stability. In this work,
   a series of materials such as Graphite oxide (GO), Molybdenum disulfide
   (MoS2), Vanadium oxide (V2O5), and Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) are tested in
   realizing a receptor layer that can efficiently sense soil moisture.
   Here, we found that MoS2 offers the sensitivity, which is nearly three
   times higher (1200 pF) than in the case of V2O5 for any given range of
   soil-moisture content outperforming both GO and MoO3 materials. The
   corresponding increase in the sensitivities for MoO3, GO, MoS2, and V2O5
   are-13 \%,-11 \%,-30 \%, and-9 \% respectively, for a variety of
   temperature up to 45 degrees C. A temperature variation of 25 degrees C
   to 50 degrees C showed a minimal increase in the sensitivity response
   for all the devices. We further demonstrated a record sensitivity of 540
   \% with MoS2 in black soil and the corresponding response time was 65 s.
   Finally, the recovery time for the MoS2 sensor is 27 s, which is quite
   fast.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to develop a robust soil moisture
   retrieval approach using multi-sensor remote sensing data. Firstly, the
   water cloud model was employed to eliminate the vegetation effects on
   SAR observations over vegetated areas, thus to obtain the bare soil
   backscatter associated with soil moisture. Then, against the
   underdetermined system for soil moisture retrieval, the advanced
   integral equation model and calibrated integral equation model were
   integrated to construct soil moisture retrieval scheme in combination
   with multi-sensor SAR observations. Through the above processing the
   influences of vegetation and surface roughness can be minimized in the
   developed soil moisture retrieval scheme. Finally, the least square
   based iteration approach was applied to derive soil moisture with
   multi-sensor SAR observations as inputs. Based on the field measurements
   and multi-sensor SAR data (C-band and X-band). acquired on June 2015 and
   October 2015 over Hebei agricultural areas, quantitative evaluation of
   the developed approach was implemented. The results indicate that
   accurate soil moisture was obtained by the developed approach over corn
   covered area and bare agricultural area. In comparison with the results
   obtained by LUT method, the least square based iteration approach
   achieved better estimations for soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Efforts to apply gridded root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) products for
   irrigation decision-support in vineyards are currently hampered by the
   difficulty of obtaining RZSM products that meet required accuracy,
   resolution, and data latency requirements. In particular, the
   operational application of soil water balance modeling is complicated by
   the difficulty of obtaining accurate irrigation inputs and representing
   complex sub-surface water-flow processes within vineyards. Here, we
   discuss prospects for addressing these shortcomings using the Vineyard
   Data Assimilation (VIDA) system based on the assimilation of
   high-resolution (30-m) soil moisture information obtained from synthetic
   aperture radar and thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing into a
   one-dimensional soil water balance model. The VIDA system is tested
   retrospectively (2017-2020) for two vineyard sites in the California
   Central Valley that have been instrumented as part of the Grape Remote
   sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX).
   Results demonstrate that VIDA can generally capture daily temporal
   variations in RZSM for vertical depths of 30-60 cm beneath the vine row,
   and the assimilation of remote sensing products is shown to produce
   modest improvement in the temporal accuracy of VIDA RZSM estimates.
   However, results also reveal shortcomings in the ability of VIDA to
   correct biases in assumed irrigation applications-particularly during
   well-watered portions of the growing season when TIR-based
   evapotranspiration observations are not moisture limited and, therefore,
   decoupled from RZSM. Prospects for addressing these limitations and
   plans for the near-real-time operational application of the VIDA system
   are discussed.},

Title = {Advancements in dielectric soil moisture sensor Calibration: A
   comprehensive review of methods and techniques},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {218},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial
   geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture,
   hydrology, meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation
   (cal/val). Therefore, accurate measurements of in situ soil moisture are
   essential to ensure the improved modeling of geophysical processes,
   perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for societal
   benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the
   gravimetric method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate,
   however, it is not suitable for real -time or large-scale field studies
   due to labor- and time -intensive procedures. In other words, the
   gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not very
   feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large
   number of in -situ observations are needed frequently as well as for
   validation of the remote sensing-based products that require sampling in
   a narrow time window during satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern
   methods like electronic sensors that measure soil moisture instantly are
   necessary for such applications. Since soil moisture sensors usually
   operate on the principle of dielectric characterization of the soil and
   water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture, these
   sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements.
   Although various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture
   sensors are available in the scientific literature, factors affecting
   calibration, the technical complexity of calibration, and lack of
   confidence in their effectiveness limits their use in field studies. In
   this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration protocols has
   been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and
   limitations of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric
   permittivity-based soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an
   appropriate calibration method based on the sensor type, soil type, and
   environmental conditions is highlighted in this review. We also examine
   various calibration methods, including traditional equations based on
   linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as the
   nonlinear approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for
   regular calibration and maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure
   accurate and reliable data is also emphasized. The review concludes by
   providing recommendations for selecting the appropriate calibration
   method/approach for dielectric soil moisture sensors to achieve the
   required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this review provides
   valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of
   dielectric sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management.},

Abstract = {One potential land in marginal areas able to be utilized for keeping the
   sustainability of agriculture in Indonesia is coastal areas. However it
   requires optimum treatment, especially in using the water for plants
   efficiently due to the factors of land characteristics and climate. This
   paper describes the use of simple and low-cost soil moisture probe for
   sandy land in the coastal area. The probe is a parallel plate which
   separated at a certain distance. The principle is based on soil
   electrical conductivity, which delivers the electrical current from one
   plate to another. Two designs (single and double) and two distances (3
   mm and 5 mm) of probes were tested to measure the sandy soil at the
   moisture content of 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%, 30\%, 35\% and
   40\%. It was found that the resistance of probes was inversely
   proportional to water content, but not linear. The best fit of probe
   resistance (X) to the moisture of sandy soil (Y) was of the 5 mm double
   parallel probe, with the equation Y = -10.33 ln(X) + 128.13 (R-2 is
   0.9199) and non-linearity of 62.88\%. The probes and a built soil
   moisture logger/controller were applied for sandy soil of Shallot
   cultivation land at coastal area in Empurancak Beach, Jepara (located
   about 150 m from the foreshore).},

Title = {Systemic Soil Fertility as product system self-organization resulting
   from management},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {45},
Abstract = {Soil Fertility is one of the most relevant fields of Soil Science
   related to agricultural production, especially in tropical and
   subtropical environments, due to the prevalence of weathered and
   naturally unproductive soils. However, indicators of Soil Fertility
   currently used do not represent what actual happens in the soil; once
   must be understood as a process. The wisdom of this importance occurred
   in Antiquity and evolved until the mid-19th century, when the mineralist
   concept was proposed, which is still dominant in Brazil and worldwide.
   In this process, Soil Fertility has been associated with current
   perceptions, soil chemical properties and management systems in the
   development of agriculture over time. During the evolution of Brazilian
   agriculture, from the 1960's onwards and most notable with the
   consolidation of conservation management in the 1990's, Intrinsic
   limitations were increasingly evident on the ability of indicators to
   assess the actual level of Soil Fertility and the respective response of
   the plants. Concurrently, the view of the soil as an open system was
   strengthened, and the conception of fertility began to constitute a
   property that emerges from the functioning of the soil, whose processes
   are self-organizing, due to the continuous flows of energy and matter
   driven by organic compounds. In this context, we present a part of the
   history of Brazilian agriculture, relating it to its management and
   Intrinsic limitations of indicators to assess Soil Fertility due to
   changes in soil functioning. The Intrinsic limitations added to
   understanding based on a systemic approach of the functional processes
   of the soil are the practical and theoretical bases for the proposition
   of another concept: Systemic Soil Fertility.},

Title = {Evaluation of the soil water content of two managed ecosystems using
   cosmic-ray neutron sensing on China's Loess Plateau},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {74},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising method for the
   continuous monitoring of soil water content (theta(v)) at the hectometre
   scale. However, few studies have validated its applicability within the
   complex terrains of various ecosystems in semiarid loess regions. In
   this study, CRNS-based theta(v) was measured on China's Loess Plateau
   under two managed ecosystems (Caragana korshinskii K. shrubland {[}KOS]
   and Medicago sativa L. grassland {[}SAG]). The accuracy of CRNS
   measurement was assessed with the traditional oven-drying method, while
   its sensitivity to theta(v) variation during the study period was
   compared with typical point-scale monitoring sensors (EC-5, Decagon
   Devices, Inc.). CRNS was found to be strongly correlated with the
   oven-drying based theta(v) under both ecosystems, with coefficients of
   determination (R-2) of 0.99 and 0.93, and root mean square errors of
   0.006 and 0.007 cm(3)/cm(3), for KOS and SAG, respectively. The mean
   monitoring radius of the CRNS was approximately 204 and 231 m for KOS
   and SAG, with a mean measurement depth of approximately 39 and 45 cm,
   respectively. Moreover, the theta(v) determined by the CRNS and EC-5
   sensors exhibited similar trends during the observation period,
   excluding that for April. However, the CRNS-based theta(v) had a higher
   spatial representation for both managed ecosystems compared with that
   for EC-5. No significant difference was detected in the response range
   of theta(v) to precipitation between the CRNS and EC-5 sensors at a
   depth of 0-10 cm, whereas the response time of CRNS for KOS was much
   shorter than that of EC-5 sensors (p < 0.01). Overall, the CRNS measured
   hectometre-scale theta(v) had acceptable accuracy and sensitively traced
   the precipitation response under different ecosystems with high theta(v)
   heterogeneity in the semiarid loess regions.},

   Based on Multitemporal Polarimetric SAR and Optical Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPECTROSCOPY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {2024},
Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Soil water content is a critical environmental parameter in research and
   practice, though various technological and contextual constraints limit
   its estimation in arid areas with vegetation cover. This study combined
   the multitemporal remote sensing data of Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 to
   conduct an inversion study on surface soil water content under low
   vegetation cover in Nagqu, central Tibetan Plateau. Four vegetation
   indices (NDVI, ARVI, EVI, and RVI) were extracted from optical remote
   sensing data. A water cloud model was used to eliminate the influence of
   the vegetation layer on the backscattering coefficient associated with
   vegetation cover, and a predictive model suitable for the Nagqu area was
   constructed. The water cloud model effectively incorporated a vegetation
   index instead of vegetation water content. We found that VV polarization
   was more suitable for soil water content inversion than VH polarization.
   Among the four vegetation indices, the soil water content inversion
   model constructed with RVI under VV polarization had the best fit (R-2 =
   0.8212; RMSE = 6.30). The second-best fit was observed for vegetation
   water content-NDVI (R-2 = 0.8201). The soil water content inversion
   models all had an R-2 > 0.6, regardless of the vegetation index used,
   though the RVI had the best fitting effect, indicating that this
   vegetation index is highly applicable in the water cloud model, as a
   substitute for vegetation water content, and is expected to perform well
   in similar study sites.},

   Mountain: A Monitoring Example},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To explore soil nutrients and moisture changes in different karst
   mountain agroforestry, in the plateau mountains of Southern China Karst,
   we used secondary tree and irrigation forest (C) as a reference for our
   study and selected four mixed agroforestry species (walnut + maize +
   potato (HYM), walnut + maize (HTY), poplar + ryegrass (YSH), and maize +
   ryegrass (YMH)) for comparison. First, soil moisture change
   characteristics were monitored in situ in the field. Second, for soil
   samples, soil bulk density, porosity, and permeability were analyzed,
   soil nutrient (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) characteristics were tested and
   analyzed. Then, we explored the relationship between agroforestry and
   soil moisture, soil moisture and soil nutrients, soil moisture and
   precipitation, and agroforestry and soil nutrients. It is shown (1)
   during the monitored period, variation trends in soil nutrients in four
   types of agroforestry was small, but it increased/decreased
   significantly compared with the secondary forest, which the variation
   range was more than 5\%; (2) the changes of soil water content were
   significantly affected by precipitation, soil porosity and permeability,
   the moisture content changes of HYM, HTY, YSH, and YMH agroforestry were
   significantly correlated with precipitation, soil porosity, and
   permeability; (3) under the same precipitation conditions, different
   types had different lags on soil water regulation, with the average HYM
   0.8 h, HTY 0.6 h, YSH 0.3 h, and YMH 0.4 h, each type soil responded at
   2-3 h after rain, and the soil moisture content returned to the normal
   level; and (4) the variation of soil moisture content fluctuated
   seasonally, and the most obvious was HYM and HTY agroforestry, their Cv
   value between winter and summer exceeded 21\%. The results provide basic
   theoretical support for further exploring the relationship among
   agroforestry, soil, moisture, and nutrients and enrich the content of
   the development of agroforestry in karst areas. They are of importance
   to promote ecological restoration and agroforestry development in karst

   Australia in 2015-2019},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {594},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Drought is one of the major hazards that could have a significant impact
   on agriculture. In this study, two drought indices at high spatial
   resolution: Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) and Soil Moisture Deficit
   Index (SMDI) were derived by 1 km downscaled Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM), Global Land Data Assimilation System
   (GLDAS) long-term SM and soil attribute products, and used to analyze
   the drought conditions in Australia in 2015-2019. The SWDI was
   calculated from SMAP SM estimates and SM at field capacity/wilting point
   derived from soil attribute data, while the SMDI was calculated by
   integrating GLDAS and SMAP SM using a temporally incremental based
   method. We found that in the eastern and western coastal regions, the
   droughts occurred during spring and summer and were relieved in fall and
   winter. The temporal change pattern of drought conditions for the
   northern coastal regions was opposite of the eastern/western coasts. On
   the other hand, the inland regions always had more severe drought
   conditions. Additionally, the validation results for the 1 km SMAP SM
   using International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in situ data showed
   reliable accuracy and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) ranged from
   0.02 to 0.09 m(3)/m(3). Both SWDI and SMDI showed clear seasonal and
   interannual variability, and the drought conditions worsened in
   2017-2019. From the 1 km SWDI/SMDI maps in the Murray-Darling River
   Basin, terrain and streamflow were found to be two deterministic factors

Title = {A Novel Approach to Interpret Soil Moisture Content for Economical
   Monitoring of Urban Landscape},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT 2},
Abstract = {Preservation of green infrastructure (GI) needs continuous monitoring of
   soil moisture. Moisture content in soil is generally interpreted on the
   basis electrical conductivity (EC), soil temperature and relative
   humidity (RH). However, validity of previous approaches to interpret
   moisture content in urban landscape was rarely investigated. There is a
   need to relate the moisture content with other parameters (EC,
   temperature and RH) to economize the sensor installation. This study
   aims to quantify the dynamics of the above-mentioned parameters in an
   urban green space, and to further develop correlations between moisture
   content and other parameters (EC, temperature and RH). An integrated
   field monitoring and statistical modelling approach were adopted to
   achieve the objective. Four distinct sites comprising treed (younger and
   mature tree), grassed and bare soil were selected for investigation.
   Field monitoring was conducted for two months to measure four
   parameters. This was followed by statistical modelling by artificial
   neural networks (ANN). Correlations were developed for estimating soil
   moisture as a function of other parameters for the selected sites.
   Irrespective of the type of site, EC was found to be the most
   significant parameter affecting soil moisture, followed by RH and soil
   temperature. This correlation with EC is found to be stronger in
   vegetated soil as compared to that without vegetation. The correlations
   of soil temperature with water content do not have a conclusive trend. A
   considerable increase in temperature was not found due to the subsequent
   drying of soil after rainfall. A normal distribution function was found
   from the uncertainty analysis of soil moisture in the case of treed
   soil, whereas soil moisture was observed to follow a skewed distribution
   in the bare and grassed soils.},

   using remote sensing techniques},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {80},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Among the Iranian plains which have experienced land subsidence, there
   is an indicator, in addition to its high rate of subsidence, soil
   salinity, and proximity to the centers of population, transportation
   routes, and infrastructures in Varamin plain, which has raised serious
   concerns about this center of land subsidence. Excessive use of
   groundwater and aquifers and lack of optimal cultivation patterns
   decrease soil fluidity, leading to land subsidence, increased soil
   salinity, and reduced surface moisture and soil moisture to a depth of
   1-2 m. The subsidence phenomenon also disrupts water storage in
   underground aquifers, making it difficult to reduce the volume of the
   reservoir and break the soil layers and fill the pores of the water
   sediment into the lower layers, and store water in the reservoirs. It
   cannot reach the underground, which is one of the main reasons for the
   decrease in soil moisture and the increase in soil salinity. In this
   study, the changes in the land subsidence during the 2014-2020 time
   period, were evaluated by Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and SNAP
   software. The soil electrical conductivity, soil surface moisture
   content, and soil moisture content in the depth of 1-2 m were calculated
   by Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, Landsat 8 satellite, and FLDAS data in
   the GEE platform, respectively. The results showed that the increase in
   land subsidence has raised soil salinity covering area and its
   intensity. As a result, moisture reduction is observed in different
   depths in recent years.},

   were built and optimized in terms of sensitivity and power transfer
   (single and four turns for ICE top and bottom coils, respectively). Soil
   moisture tests validated the ICE-LC improvements on minimized positional
   alignment sensitivity and extended read range, transducing a decrease in
   resonant frequency with increasing soil moisture. When calibrating with
   existing wired approaches, the ICE-LC sensor had a reproducible, linear
   sensor gain of 4.52\%moisture content/MHz with an R-2 of 0.745 and RMSE
   of 2.41\%. A smaller, planar form factor of the ICE-LC sensor was also
   tested and exhibited reduced positional alignment sensitivity between

Title = {Improved soil moisture estimation and detection of irrigation signal by
   incorporating SMAP soil moisture into the Indian Land Data Assimilation
   System (ILDAS)},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {638},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Land surface models have facilitated the estimation of soil moisture
   over a range of spatiotemporal scales. However, limitations in model
   parameterization and under-representation of anthropogenic processes
   restrict their ability to estimate local-scale soil moisture
   variability, especially over irrigated areas. Assimilation of
   satellite-based soil moisture retrievals into land surface models can be
   a viable approach to overcome these constraints, specially over highly
   irrigated countries such as India, where such applications are rare.
   Additionally, large-scale validation of modeled soil moisture has been
   limited over India till now due to lack of a representative station
   network. By assimilating Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-based
   estimates into the state-of-the-art Indian Land Data Assimilation System
   (ILDAS) and combining with a new soil moisture station network of more
   than 200 stations, this study demonstrates improved soil moisture
   estimations and capture of irrigation signals over the region. The
   Noah-MP land surface model is forced by multiple local and global
   meteorological datasets and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used for
   assimilation of soil moisture. Comparison of open-loop and data
   assimilated soil moisture against station soil moisture data shows
   relative spatial mean improvement of 0.0178 in correlation and 0.0029
   m3/m3 in RMSE. Further statistical comparison with in-situ data has also
   shown better results over most of the stations, as evident from improved
   correlations and reduced unbiased RMSE after assimilation. Finally, the
   climatology of soil moisture over the different irrigation fractions
   reveals that data assimilated outputs over irrigated grid cells tend to

Title = {Continental drought monitoring using satellite soil moisture, data
   assimilation and an integrated drought index},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {250},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing provides unprecedented information on
   near-surface soil moisture at a global scale, enabling a wide range of
   studies such as drought monitoring and forecasting. Data Assimilation
   (DA) has been recognized as an effective means to incorporate such
   observations into hydrologic models to better predict and forecast
   hydroclimatic variables. In this study, we use a recently developed
   Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM)
   approach to assimilate Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture
   data into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to
   provide more reliable topsoil layer moisture (0 similar to-5 cm) over
   the entire Continental United States (CONUS). The EPFM outperformed an
   Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in terms of correlations and the unbiased
   root mean square error (ubRMSE) with in situ mea-surements from the Soil
   Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and the United States Climate Reference
   Network (USCRN). Also, we used a multivariate probability distribution
   based on a Copula function to integrate the posterior soil moisture,
   precipitation (from the North American Land Data Assimilation System
   (NLDAS)) and evapotranspiration (from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) information to develop a new integrated
   drought index, i.e. SPESMI. To validate the usefulness of the developed
   integrated drought index, we compared the drought events detected by
   this index with those reported by the United States Drought Monitor
   (USDM). The results indicated a strong temporal consistency of the
   drought areas detected by our approach and the USDM over the entire
   period of study (April 2015 to June 2018). In addition to such promising
   results, we noticed that our approach could capture the flash drought in
   2017 in the U.S. Northern Plains earlier than the USDM, and could
   identify some severe to extreme drought events that had been
   underestimated by the USDM. Moreover, the SPESMI has a high correlation
   with the yield loss of spring and winter wheat in the United States.
   This novel drought monitoring framework can serve as an independent and
   potentially complementary drought monitoring system.},

Title = {Plot Layout Method of Field Experiment for Wheat with Border Irrigation
   Based on Soil Water Content Heterogeneity},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The objective of this research was to improve the accuracy and
   representativeness of experimental plot studies by determining the
   optimum plot area and replication number for winter wheat with border
   irrigation. Considering the spatial distribution of soil water content,
   the border effect in relation to crop growth, and the lateral seepage of
   soil water, we sought to study and optimize the area and specifications
   of irrigation experiment plots with different levels and replicates. The
   results show that the experimental irrigation plot consisted of two
   parts-the core area and the guard area. The most suitable area for the
   experiment plot core area, with a single level and without replicates,
   was 60-80 m2. The core experimental area can be arranged with two
   replicates per 40 m2, with differences in soil moisture content between
   the treatments reaching more than 15\% at the two experiment levels.
   Each plot comprised two replicates, or if they were 20 m2, then they
   contained three replicates; when the soil moisture contents differed
   between 10\% and 15\%, the area of each replicate plot was 80 m2,
   comprising two replicates, or 30 m2 with three replicates. When the
   difference in soil moisture content between the treatments exceeded 15\%
   with the three experimental levels, the area of each plot was 30 m2 and
   they contained two replicates, or 20 m2 containing three replicates; at
   differences of 10\% to 15\%, each replicate plot was 50 m2 containing
   two replicates, or 30 m2 with three replicates. The experimental plots
   were rectangular, with irrigation furrows dug lengthwise; therefore, the
   plots had aspect ratios between 7:1 and 5:1. The width of the buffer
   area was over 60 cm. The effect of the border on plant height and LAI
   for winter wheat primarily emerged with one to three rows (20-60 cm) at
   the jointing stage, while the effect on grain yield and biomass in
   winter wheat mainly emerged with one to two rows (20-40 cm). The
   conclusions of this research will inform the development of surface
   irrigation methods for silt loam in northern Henan, as a reference for
   optimizing experiment plots employing border irrigation with different
   soil textures.},

Title = {A Method for Performing Reforestation to Effectively Recover Soil Water
   Content in Extremely Degraded Tropical Rain Forests},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Deforestation continues to be extensive in the tropics, resulting in
   reduced soil water content. Reforestation is an effective way to recover
   soil water content, but the recovery depends on the type of
   reforestation efforts that are implemented. Monoculture of fast-growing
   species is a common reforestation strategy, because it is an effective
   means of preventing landslides resulting from the frequent typhoons and
   heavy rains in the tropics and easy to implement. To quantify whether
   monoculture plantings can help recover soil water content, we initiated
   a reforestation project within a 0.2 km(2) area of an extremely degraded
   tropical monsoon forest. We hypothesized that much higher transpiration
   rate of fast-growing tree species would deplete soil water more than the
   dominant slow-growing species in the adjacent secondary tropical rain
   forest during both wet and dry seasons, thereby resulting in much lower
   soil water content. To test this hypothesis, we compared transpiration
   rates and key functional traits that can distinguish transpiration rates
   between fast-growing and dominant slow-growing species in both wet and
   dry seasons. We also quantified whether soil water content around these
   species differed. We found that fast-growing species had transpiration
   rate and transpiration-related trait values that were 5-10 times greater
   than the dominant slow-growing species in both seasons. We also found
   that soil water content around dominant slow-growing species was 1.5-3
   times greater than for fast-growing species in both seasons. Therefore,
   reforestation based on monoculture plantings of fast-growing species
   seems difficult to effectively recover the soil water content. We also
   provide a simple method for guiding the use of reforestation efforts to
   recover soil water content in extremely degraded tropical rain forests.
   We expect that this simple method can be an effective means to restore
   extremely degraded tropical rain forests in other parts of the world.},

Title = {Quantification of irrigation water using remote sensing of soil moisture
   in a semi-arid region},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {231},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of fresh water
   resources. Most countries do not have a precise measurement of water
   consumption for irrigation. In this study, an innovative approach is
   proposed that allows for estimation of irrigation water use at the
   catchment scale based on satellite soil moisture data. To this end, the
   SM2RAIN algorithm, which had been originally developed for estimation of
   rainfall from the soil moisture observations, is adopted. The satellite
   soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) along with different rainfall and
   evapotranspiration (ET) products in the period 2012-2015 are used as the
   input to the model. The methodology is tested in the agricultural plains
   of southern Urmia Lake, which is one of the main agricultural plains in
   Iran for which actual irrigation data is available.
   The results reveal that the proposed approach can capture the overall
   irrigation pattern, although; it is systematically overestimating
   irrigation volume compared to observed irrigation data. Thus the bias is
   calculated over largely non-irrigated pixels and used to modify the
   model estimates. The bias-corrected results show good agreement with the
   in situ irrigation data. In particular, the average model performance in
   the irrigated pixels in terms of R and RMSE (mm/month) are (0.86 and
   12.895) respectively. Accuracy varied depending on the inputs, with
   improvement in order of 11\% and 42\% in R and RMSE depending on the
   inputs chosen. The method is also applied to less irrigated areas that
   result in obtaining significantly lower irrigation rates.
   The low spatial resolution of soil moisture products (i.e. similar to 50
   km) makes it difficult to capture the irrigation water of small
   irrigated croplands. Unreliable rainfall and ET data can also lead to
   the over/underestimation of irrigation. In spite of the above
   limitations (particularly lack of reliable ET dataset), the proposed
   model can still capture the irrigation pattern, given that strong soil
   moisture signal from irrigation is detected by the satellite.},

Abstract = {Aerosols have a severe impact on the Earth's climate, human health, and

   (AE) (440/ 870) data to analyze the Spatio-temporal seasonal variability
   of aerosols and their relationship with different meteorological

   observed during the summer season and low (<0.8) in the spring season.
   AE values were observed to be high (>1) in the northern regions of
   Pakistan indicating the dominance of fine mode particles during the
   winter season. Moreover, AOD showed a positive correlation with Relative
   Humidity (RH), Evapotranspiration, Wind speed (WS), and Temperature. On
   the other hand, it showed a negative correlation with Soil moisture
   (SM), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and precipitation

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {22},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Optical remote sensing (about 0.4\~{}2.0 mu m) indexes of soil moisture
   (SM) are valuable for some specific applications such as monitoring
   agricultural drought and downscaling microwave SM, due to their abundant
   data sources, higher spatial resolution, and easy-to-use features, etc.
   In this study, we evaluated thirteen typical optical SM indexes with
   aircraft and in situ observed SM from two field campaigns, the Soil
   Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12) and 2016
   (SMAPVEX16) conducted in Manitoba, Canada. MODIS surface reflectance
   products (MOD09A1) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imager Level-1C data
   were utilized to calculate the optical SM indexes. The evaluation
   results demonstrated that (1) the Visible and Shortwave Infrared Drought
   Index (VSDI) and Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) outperform the other
   eleven optical SM indexes as compared with aircraft and in situ observed
   SM. They also presented well consistence in temporal variation with the
   in situ observed SM. (2) The VSDI achieved comparable performance with
   the OPTRAM while the former has very simple calculation expression and
   the latter requires complex process to determine the dry and wet
   boundaries. (3) Both the VSDI and OPTRAM utilize two sensitive bands of
   soil and vegetation moisture, i.e., Red and SWIR bands, whereas the
   other eleven SM indexes only employ one sensitive band. This may be the
   main reason of the evaluation results. (4) Based on this recognition,
   improvements of the VSDI and OPTRAM were created and validated in this
   study through adding more sensitive band to VSDI and combining NDVI and
   modified VSDI into a new feature space for calculating the optical SM
   index as with OPTRAM. The results are conducive to selecting and
   utilizing the current numerous optical SM indexes for SM and drought
   monitoring.},

Abstract = {Quickly obtaining accurate soil quality information is the premise for
   accurate agricultural production and increased crop yield. With the
   development of the digital information industry, smart agriculture has
   become a new trend in agricultural development and there is increasing
   demand for efficiently and intelligently acquiring good soil quality
   information. Scientists worldwide have developed many remote sensing
   quantitative inversion models, which need to be systematized and
   intelligent for agricultural personnel to enjoy the dividends of
   information technology such as 3S (remote sensing, geographic
   information system, and global navigation satellite system) techniques.
   Accordingly, to meet the need of farmers, agricultural managers, and
   agricultural researchers to acquire timely information on regional soil
   quality, in this paper, we designed a cloud platform for inversion
   analysis of moisture, nutrient, salinity, and other important soil
   quality indicators. The platform was developed using ArcGIS (The
   software is produced by the Environmental Systems Research Institute,
   Inc. of America in Redlands, CL, USA) and GeoScene (The software is
   produced by GeoScene Information Technology Co.,Ltd., Beijing, China)
   software, with Java and JavaScript as programing languages and SQL
   Server as the database management system with a PC client, a web client,
   and a mobile app. On the basis of the existing quantitative remote
   sensing models, the platform realizes mapping functions, intelligent
   inversion of soil moisture-nutrient-salinity (SMNS) content, data
   analysis mining, soil knowledge base, platform management, and so on. It
   can help different users acquire, manage, and analyze data and make
   decisions based on the data. In addition, the platform can customize
   model parameters according to regional characteristics, improving
   analysis accuracy and expanding the application area. Overall, the
   platform employs 3S techniques, Internet technology, and mobile
   communication technology synthetically and realizes intelligent
   inversion and decision analysis of significant soil quality information,
   such as moisture-nutrient-salinity content. This platform has been
   applied to the analysis of soil indicators in several areas and has
   produced good operational results and benefits. This study will enable
   rapid data analysis and provide technical support for regional
   agriculture production, contributing to the development of smart
   agriculture.},

Title = {Spatial Downscaling Methods of Soil Moisture Based on Multisource Remote
   Sensing Data and Its Application},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important indicator that is widely used in
   meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. Two key problems must be
   addressed in the process of downscaling soil moisture: the selection of
   the downscaling method and the determination of the environmental
   variables, namely, the influencing factors of soil moisture. This study
   attempted to utilize machine learning and data mining algorithms to
   downscale the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing
   System (AMSR-E) soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km and compared the
   advantages and disadvantages of the random forest model and the Cubist
   algorithm to determine the more suitable soil moisture downscaling
   method for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin
   (MLRYRB). At present, either the normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) or a digital elevation model (DEM) is selected as the
   environmental variable for the downscaling models. In contrast,
   variables, such as albedo and evapotranspiration, are infrequently
   applied; nevertheless, this study selected these two environmental
   variables, which have a considerable impact on soil moisture. Thus, the
   selected environmental variables in the downscaling process included the
   longitude, latitude, elevation, slope, NDVI, daytime and nighttime land
   surface temperature (LST\_D and LST\_N, respectively), albedo,
   evapotranspiration (ET), land cover (LC) type, and aspect. This study
   achieved downscaling on a 16-day timescale based on Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A comparison of the random
   forest model with the Cubist algorithm revealed that the R-2 of the
   random forest-based downscaling method is higher than that of the Cubist
   algorithm-based method by 0.0161; moreover, the root-mean-square error
   (RMSE) is reduced by 0.0006 and the mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced
   by 0.0014. Testing the accuracies of these two downscaling methods
   showed that the random forest model is more suitable than the Cubist
   algorithm for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km
   in the MLRYRB, which provides a theoretical basis for obtaining high
   spatial resolution soil moisture data.},

Abstract = {The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s National
   Water Model (NWM) provides analyses and predictions of hydrologic
   variables relevant to drought monitoring and forecasts at fine time and
   space scales (hourly, 0.25-1 km). We present results exploring the
   potential for NWM soil moisture and streamflow analyses to inform
   operational drought monitoring. Both agricultural and hydrologic drought
   monitoring rely either explicitly or implicitly on an accurate
   representation of anomalous soil moisture values. Much of our analysis
   focuses on comparisons of soil moisture anomalies in the NWM to those
   from in-situ observations. To establish benchmarks for NWM soil moisture
   skill, we also include other gridded data sets currently used to inform
   the US Drought Monitor, specifically those from the North American Land
   Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) land surface models. We then
   compare NWM streamflow low flows with similar to 500 stream gauges from
   the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hydro-Climatic Data Network
   of undisturbed basins. The NWM soil moisture simulation's skill
   parallels that from NLDAS-2. The accuracy of drought condition
   identification from NWM streamflow exceeds that based on soil moisture
   as determined by Critical Success Index scores for extreme dry
   percentiles. Different meteorological forcings are used in the
   operational NWM cycles than those used in this retrospective analysis.
   This forcing disconnect, together with concerns about current-generation
   land surface model soil moisture-transport schemes, inhibit its current
   operational use for drought monitoring.
   The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water
   Model offers output relevant for drought monitoring. This paper
   evaluates the National Water Model soil moisture and streamflow with
   drought applications in mind, and compares those evaluations to other
   modeling tools currently used to inform drought monitoring. We find the
   model's ability to estimate anomalous low flows exceeds its ability to
   estimate anomalously dry soils, and discuss its current potential to
   inform operational drought monitoring.
   Retrospective NOAA National Water Model soil moisture and streamflow
   were evaluated for drought-monitoring applications The National Water
   Model was comparable in skill to land model guidance currently used to
   inform the US drought monitor The National Water Model's operational
   forcing strategy currently limits its application for real-time drought

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical land surface variable, impacting the water,
   energy, and carbon cycles. While in situ soil moisture monitoring
   networks are still developing, there is no cohesive strategy or
   framework to coordinate, integrate, or disseminate these diverse data
   sources in a synergistic way that can improve our ability to understand
   climate variability at the national, state, and local levels. Thus, a
   national strategy is needed to guide network deployment, sustainable
   network operation, data integration and dissemination, and user-focused
   product development. The National Coordinated Soil Moisture Monitoring
   Network (NCSMMN) is a federally led, multi-institution effort that aims
   to address these needs by capitalizing on existing wide-ranging soil
   moisture monitoring activities, increasing the utility of observational
   data, and supporting their strategic application to the full range of
   decision-making needs. The goals of the NCSMMN are to 1) establish a
   national ``network of networks{''} that effectively demonstrates data
   integration and operational coordination of diverse in situ networks; 2)
   build a community of practice around soil moisture measurement,
   interpretation, and application-a ``network of people{''} that links
   data providers, researchers, and the public; and 3) support research and
   development (R\&D) on techniques to merge in situ soil moisture data
   with remotely sensed and modeled hydrologic data to create user-friendly
   soil moisture maps and associated tools. The overarching mission of the
   NCSMMN is to provide coordinated high-quality, nationwide soil moisture
   information for the public good by supporting applications like drought
   and flood monitoring, water resource management, agricultural and
   forestry planning, and fire danger ratings.},

Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {Crop production in dryland agriculture is challenged by weed
   infestation, and soil borne diseases which are sever in poorly fertile
   and moisture deficit soils where pathogen spores and weed seeds endure
   and persist for several years. There is little knowledge and organized
   information about the impact of solarization technology on soil
   fertility, beneficial soil microorganisms, greenhouse gas emission and
   its economic feasibility in dryland agriculture. This paper aimed to
   review the role of soil solarization as pest control mechanisms, its
   effect on soil biota and soil fertility in dryland. Data and information
   were gathered, synthesized and paraphrased from relevant and peer
   reviewed published papers. Studies showed that soil solarization
   increases the total population of soil microorganisms by 477
   (no.g(-1)soil) and improves soil fertility by 16\%, reduce weed
   infestations and soil borne diseases by 90 and 80\% respectively in
   drylands, thereby it gives a yield advantage of 17.42 t ha(-1) than
   unsalaried soil. Solarization is economically profitable and gives a
   return investment of 56\% per year. It is more sounding with prior
   irrigation and biodegradable plastic films during hot seasons of dryland
   areas. This technology is safe, affordable, effective and sustainable

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {242},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Climatology (mean seasonal cycle) errors often cause large differences
   between soil moisture products. However, relatively little work has been
   done to objectively evaluate soil moisture mean seasonal cycle (SMC)
   information acquired from different sources. This study evaluates
   surface (0-10 cm) SMCs obtained from four land surface models (LSMs),
   two C/X-band and two L-band remote-sensing (RS) products using 5 dense
   networks and 75 sparse in-situ soil moisture measurement sites located
   within the contiguous United States. Results show that relative to older
   C/X-band products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), newer L-band products derived from the Soil
   Moisture Ocean and Salinity (SMOS) mission provide more accurate SMC
   estimates (with an average of 35\% root-mean-square-error reduction). In
   fact, the latest SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) product provides SMC
   intra-seasonal variability and dynamic range information that is 3-34\%
   and 2-37\% more accurate, respectively, than all four LSM-based SMCs
   examined here. Hence, SMC validation against SMOS-IC SMC results may
   improve LSMs' ability to accurately capture SMC characteristics, and the
   common strategy of scaling remote sensing SMC information to match LSM
   SMC estimates is likely sub-optimal for assimilating L-band soil
   moisture retrievals. Although the SMOS-IC product has made significant
   progresses towards retrieving absolute soil moisture values, a
   temporally constant dry bias is found in SMOS-IC surface SMCs over all
   land cover types. Addressing this bias should be a priority for future
   generations of SMOS retrieval algorithms.},

Title = {Assessing CYGNSS Satellite Soil Moisture Data for Drought Monitoring
   with Multiple Datasets and Indicators},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Drought monitoring is crucial for various sectors, and soil moisture
   data play a pivotal role, especially in agricultural contexts. This
   study focuses on the recent CYGNSS Level 3 soil moisture data derived
   from the NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS),
   notable for its wide coverage and rapid revisit times, yet underexplored
   in drought research. Spanning from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022,
   this research analyzed daily CYGNSS soil moisture data, comparing them
   with the ERA5, SMAP, and GLDAS-NOAH datasets. It was found that the
   average and standard deviation (std) of CYGNSS soil moisture exhibited
   spatial patterns largely similar to other datasets, although some
   regions showed discrepancies (std differences reached up to 0.05 in some
   regions). The correlation coefficients and RMSE values between CYGNSS
   and other datasets depended on climate and land cover types. Four
   drought indicators from different soil moisture datasets were compared
   with the improved monthly Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration
   Index (SPEI). The drought indicators based on CYGNSS data demonstrate
   the capacity to describe drought extent and intensity. The correlation
   coefficients between certain drought indicators obtained from CYGNSS and
   SPEI reached 0.27 for drought percentage and 0.16 for drought intensity.
   Further investigations with selected extreme drought cases revealed that
   the indicator from CYGNSS data is relatively weak, influenced by the
   selected regions, times, and drought indicators. The results of this
   study provide insights into the potential application of CYGNSS soil
   moisture data in drought monitoring, offering a foundation for future
   research and practical implementation with current and future improved
   products.},

Title = {Estimation of soil moisture in drip-irrigated citrus orchards using
   multi-modal UAV remote sensing},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {302},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Accurate and timely prediction of soil moisture in orchards is crucial
   for making informed irrigation decisions at a regional scale.
   Conventional methods for monitoring soil moisture are often limited by
   high cost and disruption of soil structure, etc. However, unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, with high spatial and temporal
   resolutions, offers an effective alternative for monitoring regional
   soil moisture. In this study, multi-modal UAV remote sensing data,
   including RGB, thermal infrared (TIR), and multi-spectral (Mul) data,
   were acquired in citrus orchards. The correlations between different
   sensor data and soil moisture were analyzed to construct seven input
   combinations. Convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory
   (LSTM) models and a new hybrid model (CNN-LSTM), were employed to
   predict soil moisture at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm.
   Additionally, the impact of standalone sensor, texture features and
   multi-sensor data fusion on the accuracy of soil moisture prediction was
   explored. The results indicated that the model with RGB + Mul + TIR
   achieved the highest prediction accuracy, followed by those with Mul +
   TIR and RGB + Mul, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging
   0.80-0.88, 0.64-0.84, and 0.60-0.81, and root mean square error (RMSE)
   ranging 2.46-2.99 m3 center dot m-3, 2.86-3.89 m3 center dot m- 3 and
   3.15-4.25 m3 center dot m- 3, respectively. Among single sensor inputs,
   the Mul sensor data has the highest prediction accuracy, followed by TIR
   and RGB sensor, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging
   0.54-0.72, 0.36-0.52 and 0.14-0.26, and root mean square error (RMSE)
   ranging 3.72-4.58 \%, 3.81-5.04 \% and 4.27-6.21 \%, respectively. The
   hybrid CNN-LSTM model exhibited the highest prediction accuracy,
   followed by CNN and LSTM models, with the coefficient of determination
   (R2) ranging 0.20-0.88, 0.16-0.83, and 0.14-0.81, and root mean square
   error (RMSE) ranging 2.46-5.01 m3 center dot m- 3, 2.68-5.35 m3 center
   dot m-3 and 2.81-6.21 m3 center dot m-3, respectively. The prediction
   accuracy of the models was the highest at the depth of 5 cm, followed by
   10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm, with the coefficient of determination (R2)
   average of 0.63, 0.62, 0.59, and 0.55, and root mean square error (RMSE)
   average of 3.70 m3 center dot m- 3, 3.79 m3 center dot m- 3, 3.85 m3
   center dot m- 3 and 4.21 m3 center dot m- 3, respectively. Therefore,
   the hybrid CNN-LSTM model with RGB + Mul + TIR is recommended to predict
   soil moisture in citrus orchard. It provides method and data support for
   regional precision irrigation decision-making.},

Title = {Disaggregation of remote sensing and model-based data for 1 km daily
   seamless soil moisture},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {125},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {High-resolution soil moisture (SM) products are crucial for managing
   water in agricultural regions, irrigation scheduling, and
   land-atmosphere model simulations. Most satellite-based SM products have
   spatial resolutions in the tens of kilometers, which cannot satisfy the
   aforementioned applications, and there is an urgent need to disaggregate
   them to fine spatial resolutions. Currently, disaggregation method based
   on multi-source data fusion tend to be robust, but the following
   difficulties remain: 1) satellite products (microwave, optical/infrared)
   are somewhat missing in space and time which hinder the applications; 2)
   only one model-based product is used in the fusion process and different
   model-based products were not sufficiently evaluated. To overcome these
   problems, this work developed an SM disaggregation methodology. The best
   model-based SM product was first assessed using the triple collocation
   (TC) method, which allows us to obtain the weight of individual product.
   The model-based and microwave SM products were combined based on weight
   to produce daily seamless SM data at 25 km. Second, the iterative
   multi-temporal reconstruction and the ESTARFM method were combined to
   solve the invalid grids problem of optical/infrared product, thus
   obtaining 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data. Finally, daily seamless SM
   data at 1 km were obtained by geographically weighted regression (GWR)
   method. The methodology proposed in this study had a well-defined
   mechanism, and the resulting SM product achieved a satisfied accuracy
   (ubRMSE = 0.044 m3/m3), with characteristics of spatiotemporal
   continuity as well as fine spatial detail. The disaggregated SM product
   makes full use of model-based, microwave, and optical/infrared products,
   which is valuable in areas such as agricultural management policy,
   high-resolution hydro-meteorological simulations, and disaster
   monitoring.},

Abstract = {Drone multispectral technology enables the real-time monitoring and
   analysis of soil moisture across vast agricultural lands. overcoming the
   time-consuming, labor-intensive, and spatial discontinuity constraints
   of traditional methods. This study establishes a rapid inversion model
   for deep soil moisture (0-200 cm) in dryland agriculture using data from
   drone-based multispectral remote sensing. Maize, millet, sorghum, and
   potatoes were selected for this study, with multispectral data, canopy
   leaf, and soil moisture content at various depths collected every 3 to 6
   days. Vegetation indices highly correlated with crop canopy leaf
   moisture content (p < 0.01) and were identified using Pearson
   correlation analysis, leading to the development of linear and nonlinear
   regression models for predicting moisture content in canopy leaves and
   soil. The results show a significant linear correlation between the
   predicted and actual canopy leaf moisture levels for the four crops,
   according to the chosen vegetation indices. The use of canopy leaf
   moisture content to predict surface soil moisture (0-20 cm) demonstrated
   enhanced accuracy. The models designed for the top 20 cm of soil
   moisture successfully estimated deep soil moisture levels (up to 200 cm)
   for all four crops. The 20 cm range soil moisture model showed
   improvements over the 10 cm range model, with increases in Root Mean
   Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of
   Determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) by
   0.4, 0.8, 0.73, and 0.34, respectively, in the corn area; 0.28, 0.69,

   with an average Relative Error (RE) of less than 10\% across the crops.
   Using drone-based multispectral technology, this study forecasts leaf
   water content via vegetation index analysis, facilitating swift and
   effective soil moisture inversion. This research introduces a novel

Abstract = {Remote sensing of soil moisture can provide important data for

   Data fusion has become an area of active research regarding the
   application of remote sensing data. Based on the principle of cumulative
   distribution function matching, this study proposed a continuous
   relationship establishment algorithm for multisource remote sensing soil
   moisture data. Using this new algorithm, soil Moisture and Ocean
   Salinity (SMOS) and Climate Change Initiative (CCI) satellite data from
   the Songnen Plain as test data were fused to a long time series product
   of real-time remote sensing soil moisture data. This application
   validation of this new method to SMOS and CCI indicated that this
   Lagrange interpolation continuous fusion algorithm could improve the
   fusion accuracy of multisource remote sensing soil moisture data
   significantly. The low -value region of the cumulative probability
   distribution curve is a crucial data segment for characterization of
   agricultural drought. Through implementation of the proposed continuous

   coincidence at each quantile in the low -value region of the curve.},

Year = {2021},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
   multipath signals has gained continuous interests in recent years.
   However, traditional GNSS-interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) soil
   moisture retrieval methods generally utilize a single frequency or
   single satellite, which fail to take full advantage of different and
   complementary of satellite signals with different frequencies. An
   improved algorithm for soil moisture retrieval based on principal
   component analysis (PCA) and entropy method using multi-frequency
   amplitude and phase offset fusion data was proposed in this research.
   The performance of the proposed soil moisture retrieval method was
   evaluated using data recorded by Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) H2O
   networks and a self-built site in Henan, China. The results from GPS and
   BeiDou both showed that the retrieved soil moisture has a stronger
   correlation with in situ soil moisture, which can better reflect the
   fluctuation of ground truth measurements. Compared with the traditional
   method, the retrieval accuracy of the proposed method in terms of
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) was improved by 50.93\%, and the average
   correlation coefficient were increased by 11.71\%. This research proved
   that the proposed method could effectively improve retrieval accuracy
   due to the increasing number of frequencies and tracks clustering.
   Moreover, this study has illustrated the feasibility of BeiDou signals

Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {Prehistoric peoples chose farming locations based on environmental
   conditions, such as soil moisture, which plays a crucial role in crop
   production. Ancestral Pueblo communities of the central Mesa Verde
   region became increasingly reliant on maize agriculture for their
   subsistence needs by AD 900. Prehistoric agriculturalists (e.g.,
   Ancestral Pueblo farmers) were dependent on having sufficient soil
   moisture for successful plant growth. To better understand the quality
   of farmland in terms of soil moisture, this study develops a static
   geospatial soil moisture model, the Soil Moisture Proxy Model, which
   uses soil and topographic variables to estimate soil moisture potential
   across a watershed. The model is applied to the semi-arid region of the
   Goodman watershed in the central Mesa Verde region of southwestern
   Colorado. We evaluate the model by comparing the Goodman watershed
   output to two other watersheds and to soil moisture sensor values. The
   simple framework can be used in other regions of the world, where water
   is also an important limiting factor for farming. The general outcome of
   this research is an improved understanding of potential farmland and

Abstract = {With the rapid development of soil moisture estimation techniques
   involving remote sensing technology, the sampling designs used in soil

Abstract = {The climate crisis is happening globally, and the consequent process has
   revealed soil evolution and meteorological interactions. The GNSS
   reflectometry (GNSS-R) technique recently encompassed sea surface
   monitoring, land changes, and snow sensing in addition to position,
   navigation, and timing. After the launch of NASA's eight CYGNSS
   satellites, spaceborne soil moisture retrieval has become more opportune
   in a global and regional investigation. The research carried out by the
   CYGNSS DDM SNR with SMAP data to correlate diurnal mean soil moisture
   sensing was analyzed in the regional study of Myanmar, which is prone to
   climatic and weather conditions. The results showed that spaceborne
   GNSS-R soil moisture sensitivity was very useful during seasonal changes
   in regional observation. The DDM SNR surface reflectivity was strongly
   correlated with soil moisture according to surface temperature
   variations prepared from SMAP passive reflectometry. Sentinel SAR-1 data
   included the validation and verification of flood-prone areas affected
   by tropical storm surges or weather depressions in the monsoon season.
   The availability of surface reflectivity primarily relied on the surface
   roughness, surface temperature, and vegetation opacity for soil moisture
   retrieval.},

Abstract = {Above-ground cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for the
   non-invasive estimation of the fieldscale soil moisture content in the
   upper decimetres of the soil. However, large parts of the deeper vadose
   zone remain outside of its observational window. Retrieving soil
   moisture information from these deeper layers requires extrapolation,
   modelling or other methods, all of which come with methodological
   challenges. Against this background, we investigate CRNS for downhole
   soil moisture measurements in deeper layers of the vadose zone. To
   render calibration with in situ soil moisture measurements unnecessary,
   we rescaled neutron intensities observed below the terrain surface with
   intensities measured above a waterbody. An experimental set-up with a
   CRNS sensor deployed at different depths of up to 10m below the surface
   in a groundwater observation well combined with particle transport
   simulations revealed the response of downhole thermal neutron
   intensities to changes in the soil moisture content at the depth of the
   downhole neutron detector as well as in the layers above it. The
   simulation results suggest that the sensitive measurement radius of
   several decimetres, which depends on soil moisture and soil bulk
   density, exceeds that of a standard active neutron probe (which is only
   about 30 cm). We derived transfer functions to estimate downhole neutron
   signals from soil moisture information, and we describe approaches for
   using these transfer functions in an inverse way to derive soil moisture
   from the observed neutron signals. The in situ neutron and soil moisture
   observations confirm the applicability of these functions and prove the
   concept of passive downhole soil moisture estimation, even at larger
   depths, using cosmicray neutron sensing.},

Title = {A Robust Supervised Method for Estimating Soil Moisture Content From
   Spectral Reflectance},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Due to the complex interaction of light with moist soils, the soil
   moisture content (SMC) is hard to estimate from the soil spectral
   reflectance. Spectral variability, caused by variations in viewing and
   illumination angle and between-sensor variability, further complicates
   the estimation. In this work, we developed a supervised methodology to
   accurately estimate SMC from spectral reflectance. The method determines
   a proxy for the SMC of moist soil, making use of the reflectance spectra
   of an air-dried and saturated soil sample. The proxy is made invariant
   to illumination and viewing angle, and sensor type. In the next step,
   the proxy is normalized with respect to the ground-truth SMC of the
   saturated soil to make the technique less dependent on the soil type.
   The normalized proxy can be directly used as an estimate of SMC.
   Alternatively, the nonlinear relationship between the normalized proxy
   and the actual SMC can be learned by supervised regression. Experiments
   are conducted on real moist soil data. In particular, we developed
   datasets of moist minerals, acquired by two different sensors, an
   Agrispec spectrometer and an Imec snapscan shortwave infrared (SWIR)
   hyperspectral camera, under strictly controlled experimental settings.
   The proposed methodology is also validated on the available real moist
   soil data from the literature. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the
   proposed method accurately estimates the SMC.},

Abstract = {The Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) has
   emerged as a valuable tool for terrestrial remote sensing applications,
   particularly in the context of land Surface Soil Moisture (SSM)
   detection. The high-resolution capability of GNSS-R complements
   traditional satellite-based active and passive missions but the product
   reliability and robustness evaluations are still absent due to an
   efficient retrieval algorithms. In this study, we addressed this lack of
   reliability and robustness by comprehensively assessing the SSM
   retrievals from CYclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data
   with the satellite-based microwave radiometry products Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research
   and Applications (MERRA2) over Punjab in various seasons. ERA5
   model-based products for the same period in 2022-2023. Our study reveals
   a distinct seasonal average SSM variation during autumn (0.20 cm3/cm3),
   followed by winter values of 0.19 cm3/cm3. Subsequently, the minimum SSM
   values are observed during summer (0.11 cm3/cm3) and an increase in
   spring to 0.13 cm3/cm3. Moreover, a strong positive linear relationship
   (0.74) is evident between SMAP and ERRA 5 in contrast to a low
   correlation (0.03) between MERRA2 and both the SMAP and ERRA 5.
   Additionally, SMAP demonstrates moderate and weak correlation of 0.53
   and 0.03 with CYGNSS and MERRA2, respectively. The CYGNSS exhibits
   moderate correlations (0.46) with ERRA 5 and SMAP and a weaker
   association (0.14) with MERRA2. Our analysis concluded that MERRA2 (Bias

Abstract = {The US Army is required to be a good steward of the land per US Army
   regulation AR 200-1. Based on this regulation, Army installations need
   to manage lands, to reduce potential damage and impacts to water quality
   and habitat that may occur from training. Maneuver training does impact
   the vegetation and soil and this damage is directly related to soil
   moisture. Soil moisture is an important factor for understanding the
   potential for soil surface disturbance due to vehicle impacts and
   predicting soil resilience to vehicle traffic, however, producing
   accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal variation of soil
   moisture has historically been elusive. GeoWATCH, which stands for
   Geospatial Weather-Affected Terrain Conditions and Hazards (formerly
   DASSP), simulates soil moisture world-wide, at relatively small spatial
   and temporal scales. GeoWATCH uses a physics-based downscaling approach
   that uses weather-scale land surface model estimates of soil moisture
   and land surface water and energy fluxes, with high resolution
   geospatial data. GeoWATCH soil moisture outputs coupled with vehicle
   impact models, are anticipated to be useful for near-real-time
   estimation of ground disturbance, but will require ground validation. To
   validate GeoWATCH soil moisture estimates, we utilized Soil Climate
   Analysis Network (SCAN) gauge network soil moisture data from 127 sites
   across 34 states. Statistical analysis of the raw GeoWATCH output
   indicated the model performs statistically better in certain soil
   textures. Model bias is largest for sandy soils, whereas clayey soils
   were least biased. As a result, bias correction models were applied to
   the raw GeoWATCH simulated values using linear regression to predict
   correction factor (CF) values based on physical site characteristics.
   The bias correction models significantly improved the performance of the
   GeoWATCH soil moisture model in terms of average performance statistics
   and number of statistically cally unbiased sites. This process could
   easily be incorporated into GeoWATCH, allowing for a capability to
   rapidly estimate vehicle impacts and determine rehabilitation
   requirements by installation land managers. Published by Elsevier Ltd on

   Soil Moisture Sensors},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {Featured Application
   The proposed approach for estimating reference evapotranspiration allows
   obtaining accurate approximations of this important crop parameter in an
   inexpensive way by using moisture sensors, which can be translated to an
   optimization of water resources.
   Abstract One of the most important applications of remote imaging
   systems in agriculture, with the greatest impact on global
   sustainability, is the determination of optimal crop irrigation. The
   methodology proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is
   based on estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is done by
   computing the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by a
   crop coefficient (Kc). Some previous works proposed methods to compute
   Kc using remote crop images. The present research aims at complementing
   these systems, estimating ETo with the use of soil moisture sensors. A
   crop of kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) was used as the reference
   crop. Four frequency-domain reflectometry sensors were installed,
   gathering moisture information during the study period from May 2015 to
   September 2016. Different machine learning regression algorithms were
   analyzed for the estimation of ETo using moisture and climatic data. The
   values were compared with respect to the ETo computed in an agroclimatic
   station using the Penman-Monteith method. The best method was the
   randomizable filtered classifier technique, based on the K{*} algorithm.
   This model achieved a correlation coefficient, R, of 0.9936, with a
   root-mean-squared error of 0.183 mm/day and 6.52\% mean relative error;
   the second-best model used artificial neural networks, with an R of
   0.9470 and 11\% relative error. Thus, this new methodology allows
   obtaining accurate and cost-efficient prediction models for ETo, as well
   as for the water balance of the crops.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a vital role in high agriculture yield and many
   satellite products are available to study their potentiality in soil
   moisture estimation. Hence, we considered a triangular network method
   based on MODIS products for soil moisture estimation. The reflectance
   data of MODIS was used to derive NDVI at 250 m and surface temperature
   was downscaled from 1 km to 250 m using TsHARP and TPS models.
   Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of the TVDI at 250 m
   spatial resolution to capture daily soil moisture. TVDI and in-situ soil
   moisture has high negative correlation (R2 = -0.80). The results show
   that the TVDI value on 19 January 2013 was highly co-related with
   in-situ soil moisture on 19 January 2013. The TVDI value after
   irrigation of second week of February 2013 was lower than for periods of
   no irrigation month (January). Therefore, mapping of soil moisture under
   crop condition can be possible with TVDI and satellite data input.},

Pages = {1859-1870},

Abstract = {Interception is the storage and subsequent evaporation of rainfall by
   above-ground structures, including canopy and groundcover vegetation and
   surface litter. Accurately quantifying interception is critical for
   understanding how ecosystems partition incoming precipitation, but it is
   difficult and costly to measure, leading most studies to rely on modeled
   interception estimates. Moreover, forest interception estimates
   typically focus only on canopy storage, despite the potential for
   substantial interception by groundcover vegetation and surface litter.
   In this study, we developed an approach to quantify ``total{''}
   interception (i.e., including forest canopy, understory, and surface
   litter layers) using measurements of shallow soil moisture dynamics
   during rainfall events. Across 34 pine and mixed forest stands in
   Florida (USA), we used soil moisture and precipitation (P) data to
   estimate interception storage capacity (beta(s)), a parameter required
   to estimate total annual interception (I-a) relative to P. Estimated
   values for beta(s)(mean beta(s) = 0.30 cm; 0.01 <= beta(s) <= 0.62 cm)
   and I-a/P (mean I-a/P = 0.14; 0.06 <= I-a/P <= 0.21) were broadly
   consistent with reported literature values for these ecosystems and were
   significantly predicted by forest structural attributes (leaf area index
   and percent ground cover) as well as other site variables (e.g., water
   table depth). The best-fit model was dominated by LAI and explained
   nearly 80 \% of observed beta(s) variation. These results suggest that
   whole-forest interception can be estimated using near-surface soil
   moisture time series, though additional direct comparisons would further
   support this assertion. Additionally, variability in interception across
   a single forest type underscores the need for expanded empirical
   measurement. Potential cost savings and logistical advantages of this
   proposed method relative to conventional, labor-intensive interception
   measurements may improve empirical estimation of this critical water
   budget element.},

Abstract = {Reliable soil moisture information is vital for optimal irrigation
   management, farm-level agronomic decision-making, hydrologic studies,
   and cropping systems modeling. A wide range of soil moisture sensing
   technologies is commercially available, but their performance must be
   evaluated for diverse conditions of use. In this research, we
   investigated nine soil moisture sensors based on time-domain
   reflectometry, capacitance, and electrical resistance principles in
   production field conditions with two installation orientations, i.e.,
   vertical (V) and horizontal (H), in two soils (silt loam and loamy sand)
   and two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Performance parameters deduced
   from the 2017 datasets revealed that sensor type and soil type
   significantly affected the soil moisture sensor performance under
   factory calibration (F.C.); however, sensor installation orientation did
   not. Thus, the sensors were only evaluated based on their performance in
   horizontal orientation in both soils. Precision and accuracy were
   considered targets to assist in appropriate sensor selection. To improve
   sensor accuracy, site-specific calibration (S.S.C.) functions were
   developed and validated using independent datasets from 2018.
   Considering mean bias error (MBE), all sensors overestimated volumetric
   soil water content (theta(v)) in both soils, with the exception of TEROS
   21 (MPS-6) in silt loam and JD probe in loamy sand. On average, sensor
   performance was 67\% better in loamy sand than in silt loam. Overall,
   the sensors showed higher precision in silt loam (R-2 = 0.53 to 0.93)
   than in loamy sand (R-2 = 0.25 to 0.82). Substantial post-S.S.C.
   improvement (32\% to 89\%) was observed in all sensors' performance
   relative to F.C. in silt loam. In loamy sand, while most sensors
   performed reasonably well with F.C., considerable improvements (28\% to
   85\%) were observed with S.S.C. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were
   observed in sensors' sensitivity to soil temperature (T-soil), which
   ranged from 14 degrees C to 23 degrees C in silt loam and from 14
   degrees C to 25 degrees C loamy sand during the experiments. The CS655,
   10HS, 5TE, and TEROS 21 (MPS-6) sensors showed significant (p < 0.05)
   sensitivity to T-soil fluctuations, with T-soil explaining a maximum of
   17\% of the variance observed in sensor performance. No statistically
   significant (p > 0.05) sensitivity was detected for any of the sensors
   in loamy sand. TEROS 21 (MPS-6) had the highest sensitivity to T-soil
   with a slope of -4.25. In contrast, while statistically significant (p <
   0.05), 5TE was the least sensitive to T-soil variability with a slope of
   1.81. The information, data, and analyses presented here can be
   instrumental for informed sensor selection and use in decision-making in
   production fields with similar soil textures and soil water regimes.},

Title = {Reconstruction of ESA CCI satellite-derived soil moisture using an
   artificial neural network technology},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {782},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a vital variable for controlling water and heat
   exchange between the atmosphere and land surface. Spatiotemporally
   continuous satellite-derived SM information is urgently needed for
   large-scale meteorological and hydrological applications. This study
   proposes the application of a spatial gap-Idling method using an
   artificial neural network (ANN) to reconstruct missing records of daily
   surface SM from the Climate Change Initiative program of the European
   Space Agency (ESA CCI) in the growing seasons of 1982-2015 across China.
   Ten environmental variables were taken into consideration, including
   meteorological forcing, geographic and topographic features, vegetation
   conditions, and soil texture. The ANN-reconstructed SM and
   RF-reconstructed SM were validated using the ground-based observations
   and three global reanalysis SM datasets. The gap-filling results by the
   ANN model were compared to that by the original kriging (OK) model under
   three simulation scenarios: SM images with removed swaths, varying
   vegetation densities, and different percentages of data gaps. The
   results showed that the ANN-reconstructed SM was in good agreement with
   in-situ SM observations, with the CC more than 0.607 and the RMSE less
   than 0.074 m(3)/m(3) over the northwestern and eastern parts of China.
   Compared with the original ESA CCI SM, the ANN model performed better
   than the OK model in reconstructing SM with absent swaths and in densely
   and sparsely vegetated regions. Specifically, the ANN-reconstructed SM
   provided a higher estimation accuracy in regions with low-density
   vegetation than in those with high-density vegetation. The weaker
   performance may due to the complex interactions between surface SM and
   various environmental variables underneath the dense vegetation. In
   addition, the ANN model significantly outperformed the OK model by
   accurately estimating SM when the percentage of data gaps succeeded
   40\%. Our study is valuable for providing an alternative reference to
   reconstruct satellite-derived SM and highlights the potential of using
   the ANN model. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An experiential account with recommendations for the design,
   installation, operation and maintenance of a farm-scale soil moisture
   sensing and mapping system},
Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Number = {5},
Abstract = {Context The research explores the benefits of real time tracking of soil
   moisture for various land management contexts and the importance of
   spatio-temporal modelling and mapping to gain clear and visual
   understanding of soil moisture fluxes across a farm.Aims This research
   aims to outline the key processes required for building an operational
   on-farm soil moisture monitoring system where the product is highly
   granular daily soil moisture maps depicting variations temporally,
   spatially and vertically.Methods We describe processes of capacitance
   soil moisture probe installation, data collection infrastructure, sensor
   calibration, spatio-temporal modelling, and mapping.Key results An
   out-of-bag soil moisture evaluation modelling system was tested for
   nearly 2 years. We found a model accuracy (RMSE) estimate of 0.002 cm-3
   cm-3 and concordance of 0.96 were found. This result is averaged over
   this period but fluctuated daily, and related to rainfall patterns
   across the target farm, which were not directly incorporated into the
   modelling framework. As expected, incorporating prior estimates of soil
   moisture into the modelling framework contributed to very accurate
   estimates of real time available soil moisture.Conclusions This research
   promotes the importance of iterative improvements to the soil moisture
   monitoring system, particularly in areas of sensor recalibration and
   spatio-temporal modelling. We stress the need for a longer-term view and
   plan for ongoing maintenance and improvement of such systems in the
   emerging digital farming ecosystem.Implications The results of this
   research will be useful for researchers and practitioners involved in
   the design and implementation of on-farm soil monitoring systems.
   Soil moisture sensing enables precision capability to manage crop
   productivity. We designed and implemented a spatial, vertical and
   temporal model for mapping soil moisture at the farm level. Upscaling
   data from soil probes to the farm level provides better insights about
   fluxes of soil moisture. Our on-farm soil moisture monitoring system is
   modular, with each component that can be readily updated and improved.
   Soil moisture monitoring networks cannot be set-and-forget systems, but
   require longer term planning and monitoring.},

Title = {Calibration, measurement, and characterization of soil moisture dynamics
   in a central Amazonian tropical forest},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological, biogeochemical, and
   energy budgets of terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate soil moisture
   measurements in remote ecosystems such as the Amazon are difficult and
   limited because of logistical constraints. Time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) sensors are widely used to monitor soil moisture and require
   calibration to convert the TDR's dielectric permittivity measurement
   (K-a) to volumetric water content (theta(v)). In this study, our
   objectives were to develop a field-based calibration of TDR sensors in
   an old-growth upland forest in the central Amazon, to evaluate the
   performance of the calibration, and then to apply the calibration to
   determine the dynamics of soil moisture content within a 14.2-m-deep
   vertical soil profile. Depth-specific TDR calibration using local soils
   in a controlled laboratory setting yielded a novel K-a-theta(v)
   third-degree polynomial calibration. The sensors were later installed to
   their specific calibration depth in a 14.2-m pit. The widely used
   K-a-theta(v) relationship (Topp model) underestimated the site-specific
   theta(v) by 22-42\%, indicating significant error in the model when
   applied to these well-structured, clay-rich tropical forest soils. The
   calibrated wet- and dry-season theta(v) data showed a variety of depth
   and temporal variations highlighting the importance of soil textural
   differentiation, root uptake depths, as well as event to seasonal
   precipitation effects. Data such as these are greatly needed for
   improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes within tropical
   forests and for improving models of these systems in the face of
   changing environmental conditions.},

Journal = {ENGENHARIA AGRICOLA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Soil fertility attributes have different scales and forms of spatial and
   temporal variations in agricultural fields. Adequate spatiotemporal
   characterization of these attributes is fundamental to the successful
   development of strategies for variable rate application of fertilizers,
   enabling the classic benefits of precision agriculture (PA). Studies on
   Brazilian soil have shown that at least 1 sample ha(-1) is required for
   the reliable mapping of key fertility attributes. However, this sampling
   density is difficult owing to the operational challenges of sample
   collection and the cost of laboratory analyses. Given this limitation,
   soil sensors have emerged as a practical and complementary technique for
   obtaining information on soil attributes, at high spatial density,
   without the production of chemical residues and at a reduced cost.
   Scientists worldwide have devoted their attention to the development and
   application of sensor systems for this purpose. The concept of proximal
   soil sensing (PSS) was established in 2011 and involves the application
   of soil sensors directly on the field. PSS techniques involve different
   disciplines, such as instrumentation, data science, geostatistics, and
   predictive modeling. The integration of these different disciplines has
   allowed successful sensor application for the spatial diagnosis of soil
   fertility attributes. The present work aimed to present a bibliographic
   review of the concepts involved and main techniques used in soil sensing
   to predict fertility attributes. We sought to present a broad view of
   the challenges, advances, and perspectives of sensor application in
   Brazilian tropical soils in the context of PA.},

Abstract = {Real-time measurement of sewage sludge moisture content renders it
   possible to optimize the consumption of auxiliary fuel and the thermal
   treatment. Thus, we explored whether a dielectric soil moisture sensor
   could be used to measure real-time changes in sludge moisture content.
   This was possible with the aid of a unified calibration curve. The
   explanatory variable was the third-order sensor output voltage. The
   calibration curve well-fitted the data; the mean measurement error was
   6.14 wt.\%. The use of individual calibration curves for each sludge
   batch reduced the mean measurement error to 3.09 wt.\%. The mean
   measurement error improves when multiple sensors are simultaneously
   used. The sensor operates very well when the moisture content is low;
   the results are minimally affected by the bulk density and Fe level.
   Considering feed-back to the process, it is ideal to measure sludge
   moisture content near the outlet of the thermal treatment.},

Volume = {71},
Abstract = {This work proposes a single probe imitation of multidepth capacitive
   soil moisture sensor for low-cost and energy-efficient implementation of
   IoT-assisted wireless sensor network (IoWSN) farm monitoring
   infrastructure. A conditioning circuit (CC) is devised to capture the
   behavior of soil water movement and its impact on soil moisture around
   the probe at different depths. The captured correlation is used to train
   the proposed neural network (NN) models to estimate the soil water
   content (SWC) at different soil depths based on a single measurement
   taken at the reference depth. To adjust the weight of the neurons,
   training and test dataset are collected through a measurement campaign.
   The data are collected during the cropping period of paddy vegetation by
   deploying 150 sensor nodes at different depths in hare land before
   sowing. Two NN models-artificial neural network (ANN) and bidirectional
   long short term memory network (BLSTM)-are proposed and compared based
   on the accuracy of SWC estimation. To demonstrate the efficacy of the
   concept, the proposed sensor design is compared with relevant soil
   moisture sensors reported over the past five years. The root mean square

Abstract = {Reliable measurement of soil moisture is one of the primary requirements
   for agriculture, irrigation manage-ment, and the study of soil-water

   sensor readings is minimized. Further, the pre-processed recalibration
   data is used to develop linear, polynomial, and optimized 3-layer
   FFBP-NN (feedforward backpropagation neural network) direct and inverse
   models of the sensor. Performance evaluation of the models indicate that
   goodness of fit and accuracy of the FBNN models is the highest, followed

Title = {Impact of calibrating a low-cost capacitance-based soil moisture sensor
   on AquaCrop model performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {353},
Month = {FEB 27},
Abstract = {Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve
   irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and
   production in response to the soil-water environment need to be
   parsimonious in terms of structure, inputs and parameters to be applied
   in data scarce regions. Irrigation management using soil moisture
   sensors requires them to be site-calibrated, low-cost, and maintainable.
   Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling combined with
   low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability.
   This study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100
   soil moisture sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning
   models, with both laboratory and field data. The best calibration
   technique, field-based piece-wise linear regression (calibration r2 =
   0.76, RMSE = 3.13 \%, validation r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), was used to
   study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance of the FAO
   AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil
   hydraulic parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping
   season in 2018, in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains,
   resulting in some best practices regarding sensor calibration being
   recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated best in field
   conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100) taken
   as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), followed by laboratory
   calibration against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry -down (r2 =
   0.66, RMSE = 5.26 \%) and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE =
   6.29 \%). Moreover, model overfitting with machine learning algorithms
   led to poor field validation performance. The soil moisture simulation
   of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating raw reference
   sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant
   impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved
   significantly. Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate
   AquaCrop led to poorer performances than using the literature. Hence
   using literature values could save sensor costs without compromising
   model performance if sensor calibration was not possible. The results
   suggest the essentiality of calibrating lowcost soil moisture sensors
   for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity.},

   multi-sensor satellite images},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {We propose a new architecture based on a fully connected feed-forward
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model to estimate surface soil moisture
   from satellite images on a large alluvial fan of the Kosi River in the
   Himalayan Foreland. We have extracted nine different features from
   Sentinel-1 (dual-polarised radar backscatter), Sentinel-2 (red and
   near-infrared bands), and Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission (digital
   elevation model) satellite products by leveraging the linear data fusion
   and graphical indicators. We performed a feature importance analysis by
   using the regression ensemble tree approach and also feature sensitivity
   to evaluate the impact of each feature on the response variable. For
   training and assessing the model performance, we conducted two field
   campaigns on the Kosi Fan in December 11-19, 2019 and March 01-06, 2022.
   We used a calibrated TDR probe to measure surface soil moisture at 224
   different locations distributed throughout the fan surface. We used
   input features to train, validate, and test the performance of the
   feed-forward ANN model in a 60:10:30 ratio, respectively. We compared
   the performance of ANN model with ten different machine learning
   algorithms {[}i.e., Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Radial
   Basis Network (RBN), Exact RBN (ERBN), Gaussian Process Regression
   (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Boosting
   Ensemble Learning (Boosting EL), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Binary
   Decision Tree (BDT), and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)]. We
   observed that the ANN model accurately predicts the soil moisture and
   outperforms all the benchmark algorithms with correlation coefficient (R
   = 0.80), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE = 0.040 m(3)/m(3)), and bias =
   0.004 m(3)/m(3). Finally, for an unbiased and robust conclusion, we
   performed spatial distribution analysis by creating thirty different
   sets of training-validation-testing datasets. We observed that the
   performance remains consistent in all thirty scenarios. The outcomes of
   this study will foster new and existing applications of soil moisture.},

Abstract = {There is limited adoption of irrigation scheduling tools that could
   improve application timing and water use efficiency in row-crop
   production systems common to the mid-southern United States. The
   objectives of this manuscript are to describe a sensor-based irrigation
   scheduling method and review its effects on water applied and crop
   productivity. The effects of scheduling irrigation based on the
   recommended construction, deployment, and utilization of the WATERMARK
   200SS granular matrix (WATERMARK) sensor on water applied, crop
   productivity, and crop water use efficiency were reviewed for corn (Zea
   mays L.), soybean {[}Glycine max L. (Merr.)], peanut (Arachis hypogaea
   L.), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) produced in the Prairie region
   of Arkansas and the Delta regions of Arkansas and Mississippi. For corn
   and soybean, on-farm research indicates the recommended irrigation
   threshold of -85 to -100 cbar reduces total water applied up to 40\%
   while maintaining or improving yield up to 3\%, net returns up to \$39
   acre(-1), and irrigation water use efficiency up to 51\% for soil
   textures ranging from very fine sandy loam to clay. Similarly, for
   peanut and cotton, results indicate the irrigation threshold that
   minimizes water use while maximizing yield and net returns is -50 cbar
   and -100 cbar, respectively. The recommended method for scheduling
   irrigations with a WATERMARK 200SS soil moisture sensor promotes the
   efficient use of water in row-crop production systems common to the
   mid-southern USA.},

Abstract = {Reanalysis soil moisture products are valuable for diverse applications,
   but their quality assessment is limited due to scale discrepancies when
   compared to traditional in situ point-scale measurements. The emergence
   of cosmic ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) with field-scale soil moisture
   estimates ( similar to 250 m radius, up to 0.7 m deep) is more suitable
   for the product evaluation owing to their larger footprint. In this
   study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of eight widely used
   reanalysis soil moisture products (ERA5-Land, CFSv2, MERRA2, JRA55,
   GLDAS-Noah, CRA40, GLEAM and SMAP L4 datasets) against 135 CRNS sites
   from the COSMOS-UK, COSMOS-Europe, COSMOS USA and CosmOz Australia
   networks. We evaluate the products using six metrics capturing different
   aspects of soil moisture dynamics. Results show that all reanalysis
   products generally exhibit good temporal correlation with the
   measurements, with the median temporal correlation coefficient ( R )
   values spanning 0.69 to 0.79, though large deviations are found at sites
   with seasonally varying vegetation cover. Poor performance is observed
   across products for soil moisture anomalies time series, with R values
   varying from 0.46 to 0.66. The performance of reanalysis products
   differs greatly across regions, climate, land covers and topographic
   conditions. In general, all products tend to overestimate data in arid
   climates and underestimate data in humid regions as well as grassland.
   Most reanalysis products perform poorly in steep terrain. Relatively low
   temporal correlation and high bias are detected in some sites from the
   west of the UK, which might be associated with relatively low bulk
   density and high soil organic carbon. Overall, ERA5-Land, CRA40, CFSv2,
   SMAP L4 and GLEAM exhibit superior performance compared to MERRA2,
   GLDAS-Noah and JRA55. We recommend that ERA5-Land and CFSv2 could be
   used in humid climates, whereas SMAP L4 and CRA40 perform better in arid
   regions. SMAP L4 has good performance for cropland, while GLEAM is more
   effective in shrubland regions. Our findings also provide insights into
   directions for improvement of soil moisture products for product
   developers.},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture in real-time is an important parameter that
   helps farmers decide to enhance agriculture productivity and reduce
   resource wastage for better production and plant growth. In this work,
   we presented an easy-to-use and highly sensitive screen-printed flexible
   soil moisture sensor array to monitor soil moisture remotely for
   precision agriculture. The proposed sensor is based on a unique
   interdigitated electrode (IDE)-based capacitive structure with
   conductive carbon ink printed on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate
   (PET) substrate using the screen printing technique. Before soil
   moisture monitoring, the sensor is tested for humidity monitoring in an
   environmental chamber. A response of -144-1760 pF for 20-100\%RH with
   10\%RH variation is observed for a single sensor, while an array
   configuration ranges from -127-1802 pF. The sensor response is observed
   for a temperature range from 20 to 50 `C. The sensor's sensitivity for
   relative humidity sensing is 19.123\%pF/RH, and the response and
   recovery time are -3.3 s and -4.2 s. Further, the sensor is tested for
   soil moisture sensing, as moisture content is gradually added to the
   completely dry soil. A highly sensitive response for soil moisture
   content (MC) with a -40.7\%pF/MC sensitivity is obtained. The sensor
   data is transmitted wirelessly using a Bluetooth module. The sensor is
   supported by a wooden stick, which illustrates the capabilities of
   biodegradability, the sensor is cost-effective and provides a real-time
   measurement for soil moisture. The sensors have the potential to provide
   maintenance-free monitoring, facilitating precise control of irrigation
   practices in precision agriculture. With their affordability and ability
   to operate on a large scale, the sensor offers promising opportunities
   for enhancing irrigation systems.},

Title = {Estimation of Evapotranspiration Rates and Root Water Uptake Profiles
   From Soil Moisture Sensor Array Data},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {57},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Evapotranspiration is arguably the least quantified component of the
   hydrologic cycle. We propose two complementary strategies for estimation
   of evapotranspiration rates and root water uptake profiles from
   soil-moisture sensor-array data. One is our implementation of ensemble
   Kalman filter (EnKF); it treats the evapotranspiration sink term in the
   Richards equation, rather than soil moisture, as the observable to
   update. The other is a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) applied to the
   same observable; it is supplemented with the Fisher information matrix
   to quantify uncertainty in its predictions. We use numerical experiments
   to demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of these
   techniques. We found our EnKF implementation to be two orders of
   magnitude faster than either the standard EnKF or MLE, and our MLE
   procedure to require an order of magnitude fewer iterations to converge
   than its counterpart applied to soil moisture. These findings render our
   methodologies a viable and practical tool for estimation of the root
   water uptake profiles and evaporation rates, with the MLE technique to
   be used when the prior knowledge about evapotranspiration at the site is
   elusive.},

Title = {The regulation effect of preventing soil nitrogen loss using microbial
   quorum sensing inhibitors},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {246},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Preventing soil nitrogen (N) losses driven by microbial nitrification
   and denitrification contributes to improving global environmental
   concerns caused by NO3  -N leaching and N2O emission. Quorum sensing
   (QS) signals regulate nitrification and denitrification of N-cycling
   bacteria in pure culture and water treatment systems, and mediate the
   composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing
   bacteria (AOB) in activated sludge. However, whether disrupting QS could
   prevent soil N losses remains unclear. This study explored the
   feasibility of applying quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) as an
   innovative strategy to reduce N losses from agricultural soils. The two
   QSIs, penicillic acid and
   4-iodo-N-{[}(3S)-tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl]-benzeneacetamide (4-iodo
   PHL), were more effective in reducing N losses than traditional
   inhibitors, including N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and
   3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate. After 36 days of aerobic incubation,
   penicillic acid and 4-iodo PHL inhibited nitrification by 39\% and 68\%,
   respectively. The inhibitory effects are attributed to the fact that
   4-iodo PHL decreased the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes,
   as well as the relative abundance of Candidatus Nitrocosmicus (AOA),
   Candidatus Nitrososphaera (AOA), and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizing
   bacteria/comammox), while penicillic acid reduced archaeal amoA
   abundance and the relative abundance of Nitrosospira (AOB) and the
   microbes listed above. Penicillic acid also strongly inhibited
   denitrification (33\%) and N2O emissions (61\%) at the peak of N2O
   production (day 4 of anaerobic incubation) via decreasing nitrate
   reductase gene (narG) abundance and increasing N2O reductase gene (nosZ)
   abundance, respectively. Furthermore, the environmental risks of QSIs to
   microbial community structure and network stability, CO2 emissions, and
   soil animals were acceptable. Overall, QSIs have application potential
   in agriculture to reduce soil N losses and the associated effect on
   climate change. This study established a new method to mitigate N losses
   from the perspective of QS, and can serve as important basis of
   decreasing the environmental risks of agricultural nonpoint source
   pollution.},

Title = {A Seven-Rod Dielectric Sensor for Determination of Soil Moisture in
   Well-Defined Sample Volumes},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This paper presents a novel seven-rod sensor used for time-domain
   reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR)
   measurements of soil water content in a well-defined sample volume. The
   probe directly measures the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum and
   for this purpose requires three calibration media: air, water, and
   ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to study the
   influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the
   probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as
   a verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soilssandy
   loam and two silt loamswith six water contents from air-dry to
   saturation. The conversion from <mml:semantics>S11</mml:semantics>
   parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network
   analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid
   procedure. The simulation and measurement results for the real part of
   the isopropanol dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers
   with different diameters were in good agreement with literature data up
   to 200 MHz. The real part of the dielectric permittivity was extracted
   and related to the moisture of the tested soil samples. Relations
   between the volumetric water content and the real part of the dielectric
   permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by TDR) were
   compared with Topp's equation. It was concluded that the best fit to
   Topp's equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data
   calculated according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and
   Roth gave results closer to Topp's calibration. The obtained results
   indicated that the seven-rod probe can be used to accurately measure of
   the dielectric permittivity spectrum in a well-defined sample volume of
   about 8 cm(3) in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 200 MHz.},

Title = {Evaluations of Soil Resistivity in Relation to Basal Stem Rot Incidences
   Using Soil Moisture Sensor},
Journal = {PERTANIKA JOURNAL OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Number = {1},
Pages = {225-234},
Abstract = {Basal stem rot (BSR) caused by Ganoderma boninense is a major disease
   attacking the oil palm plantation in Malaysia, and incur big losses in
   palm oil industries. The disease is spread mostly by root either through
   spore availability in soil or roots contacts. Soil properties were
   reported to have significant influence on the growth of fungi.
   Meanwhile, the value of soil resistivity is influenced by soil
   properties. This paper presents a new approach of BSR detection by using
   soil moisture sensor which measures resistivity of soil in unit ohm
   (Omega) at 15 cm surrounding the basal stem of oil palm trees. The study
   was conducted on 39 oil palm trees at different healthiness levels. The
   sensor was embedded approximately 4.7 cm deep in the soil at eight
   different points for each palm. The results showed that healthy oil palm
   trees significantly have higher mean (ERMEAN >= 400) of electrical
   resistance (ER) readings compared to infected trees (ERMEAN< 400). More
   specifically, ER readings at points without symptoms (i.e. fruiting
   bodies and/or hollow) were significantly higher compared with ER
   readings at points where symptoms appeared even though the points of
   measurements were on the same palm. This finding has brought to the
   introduction of a new index to detect Ganoderma infection, named as
   K-index. Combination of ERMEAN taken from eight points of measurement
   and its K-index gave better results of detection and a new model was
   developed based on these two parameters (i.e. ERMEAN and K-index). The
   developed model has accuracy rates of 82\% and gained 100\% successful
   rate during validation. This research showed that soil resistivity can
   contribute to Ganoderma-infected detection in oil palms with a high
   degree of accuracy.},

   Variable Electrical Conductivity},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {In this work, the performance of the TEROS 12 electromagnetic sensor,
   which measures volumetric soil water content (theta), bulk soil
   electrical conductivity (sigma(b)), and temperature, is examined for a
   number of different soils, different theta and different levels of the
   electrical conductivity of the soil solution (ECW) under laboratory
   conditions. For the above reason, a prototype device was developed
   including a low-cost microcontroller and suitable adaptation circuits
   for the aforementioned sensor. Six characteristic porous media were
   examined in a theta range from air drying to saturation, while four
   different solutions of increasing Electrical Conductivity (ECw) from
   0.28 dS/m to approximately 10 dS/m were used in four of these porous
   media. It was found that TEROS 12 apparent dielectric permittivity
   (epsilon(a)) readings were lower than that of Topp's permittivity-water
   content relationship, especially at higher soil water content values in
   the coarse porous bodies. The differences are observed in sand (S),
   sandy loam (SL) and loam (L), at this order. The results suggested that
   the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content
   (theta(m)) and epsilon(0.5)(a) was strongly linear (0.869 < R-2 <
   0.989), but the linearity of the relation theta(m)-epsilon(0.5)(a)
   decreases with the increase in bulk EC (sigma(b)) of the soil. The most
   accurate results were provided by the multipoint calibration method
   (CAL), as evaluated with the root mean square error (RMSE). Also, it was
   found that epsilon(a) degrades substantially at values of sigma(b) less
   than 2.5 dS/m while epsilon(a) returns to near 80 at higher values.
   Regarding the relation epsilon(a)-sigma(b), it seems that it is strongly
   linear and that its slope depends on the pore water electrical
   conductivity (sigma(p)) and the soil type.},

Abstract = {In order to provide theoretical basis to the Caragana korshinskii root
   system investigation work, with the Caragana korshinskii root system at
   the farming-pastoral ecotone of Inner Mongolia as the research object,
   we employ the tracking mining method to investigate the taproot
   diameter, average length of root systems of various diameter classes and
   branch number of Caragana korshinskii, and measure the rhizosphere soil
   water content. Based on that, we discuss the relationship between the
   structural features of Caragana korshinskii root system and the soil
   water content and taproot diameter. The results show that as the soil
   water content increased from 3.5-4.0\% to 5.5-6.0\%, the ratios of the
   average lengths of bone root, thick root and fine root declined from
   1:0.51:0.14 to 1:0.47:0.13, and the ratios of the branch numbers of bone
   root, thick root and fine root increases from 1:4.43:34.94 to
   1:4.60:37.13; as the taproot diameter increased from 40-50mm to 7080mm,
   the ratios of the average lengths of bone root, thick root and fine root
   declined from 1:0.44:0.13 to 1:0.41:0.11, the ratios of the branch
   numbers of bone root, thick root and fine root increases from 1:5:30 to
   1:6:50, and both the average length of root systems of various diameter
   classes and branch number presented strong correlation with the soil
   water content. We build the relation model between the structural
   eigenvalues of root systems of various diameter classes and the soil
   water content and taproot diam- eter, and obtain
   R-LG=0.99w(2)-39.82r(2)- 7.12w+38.74r+7.49, R-NG=8.22e(2.03r)-4.24w+5

   of bone root, m; RNG is the branch number of bone root, branch; R-LC is
   the average length of thick root, m; R-NC is the branch number of thick
   root, branch; R-LX is the average length of fine root, m; R-NX is the
   branch number of fine root, branch; r is the taproot diameter, m; w is

   describe the relationship between the structural features of Caragana
   korshinskii root systems of various diameter classes in Huanghua Dianzi
   Basin and the soil water content and taproot diameter. The research
   results have significant importance to the planting management of

Abstract = {Spectroscopy has been applied in monitoring soil nutrient
   concentrations. Two types of soil samples, sandy loam and silty loam,
   were selected as the research objects. The UV-visible near-infrared
   reflectance spectroscopy data and total carbon (TC), total nitrogen
   (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen
   (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (FK), and slowly
   available potassium (SK) concentrations were measured. We compared the
   prediction results within and between two different types of soil with
   regard to the soil nutrient concentrations using four modeling methods,
   which were principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares
   regression (PLSR), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and
   back propagation neural network (BPNN) models. In the prediction results
   within a given type of soil, LS-SVM and PLSR had better stability. In
   the prediction results of different types of soil, BPNN and LS-SVM had a
   high accuracy in most soil nutrient concentrations. By comparing
   different modeling methods, this study provides a basis for the
   subsequent selection of suitable models based on spectral technology to
   establish various soil nutrient models.},

Title = {Retrieving Surface Soil Water Content Using a Soil Texture Adjusted
   Vegetation Index and Unmanned Aerial System Images},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Surface soil water content (SWC) is a major determinant of crop
   production, and accurately retrieving SWC plays a crucial role in
   effective water management. Unmanned aerial systems (UAS) can acquire
   images with high temporal and spatial resolutions for SWC monitoring at
   the field scale. The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm
   to retrieve SWC by integrating soil texture into a vegetation index
   derived from UAS multispectral and thermal images. The normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-s) derived
   from the UAS multispectral and thermal images were employed to construct
   the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) using the trapezoid
   model. Soil texture was incorporated into the trapezoid model based on
   the relationship between soil texture and the lower and upper limits of
   SWC to form the texture temperature vegetation dryness index (TTVDI).
   For validation, 128 surface soil samples, 84 in 2019 and 44 in 2020,
   were collected to determine soil texture and gravimetric SWC. Based on
   the linear regression models, the TTVDI had better performance in
   estimating SWC compared to the TVDI, with an increase in R-2
   (coefficient of determination) by 14.5\% and 14.9\%, and a decrease in
   RMSE (root mean square error) by 46.1\% and 10.8\%, for the 2019 and
   2020 samples, respectively. The application of the TTVDI model based on
   high-resolution multispectral and thermal UAS images has the potential
   to accurately and timely retrieve SWC at the field scale.},

Title = {Impact of Soil Moisture Initializations on WRF-Simulated North American
   Monsoon System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {126},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {This study investigates the influence of soil moisture initialization on
   the North American Monsoon System (NAMS) using the Weather Research and
   Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with Noah-MP Land Surface Model. Five
   sets of experiments using different soil moisture initializations were
   conducted from May 1 to October 1 in 2015-2017. The model forecast for
   each set of experiments consists of five ensemble members. The
   simulation using North American Regional Reanalysis is the control run
   (WRF-Ctrl). Four sets of sensitivity experiments were conducted with
   extremely wet (WRF-Wet) and dry (WRF-dry) initial conditions and using
   different soil moisture products from the Global Land Data Assimilation
   System (WRF-GLDAS) and NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive L4 (WRF-SMAP).
   Results show that the WRF model can capture the key features of the
   NAMS, but it exhibits a wet bias in the higher elevation regions and a
   dry bias in the lower elevation regions. Our analysis of extremely wet
   and dry cases reveals that initial soil moisture conditions can affect
   precipitation through both modulating surface energy partitioning and
   influencing large-scale pressure and wind patterns. When different soil
   moisture products are used to initialize the model, it can lead to
   substantial changes in spatial pattern of the NAM precipitation.
   Initializing the model with SMAP and GLDAS can reduce the overestimation
   of precipitation over high terrain areas. The results indicate that
   high-quality soil moisture products have the potential to improve model
   representation of the NAMS, especially with future improvements in model
   convective parameterization.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In the context of climate change, drought has been recognised as one of
   the most severe threats for agricultural production since absence of
   water is one of the most limiting factors for the growth of plants. In
   this study, a regional system for soil moisture prediction based on ERA5
   climate reanalysis dataset, an open-source meteorological dataset issued
   by Copernicus Climate Change Service, was developed. It consisted of the
   relevant meteorological parameters for Serbia, during the period
   2011-2020. Daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature,
   precipitation and vapour pressure deficit were used as features, and
   they were fed to recurrent neural network in order to predict volumetric
   soil moisture for three days ahead. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
   network was designed and trained at a regional scale using the data from
   the 2011-2016 period, at 28 locations that cover four major soil types.
   Validation was done on 2017-2018 data and LSTM was compared with a
   statistical forecasting technique and a classical machine learning
   approach. Evaluation was done with error measures commonly used in
   literature. The resulting network yielded the lowest errors and proved
   to have good generalisation properties. The system was tested from
   September 2019 to April 2020 using short-range weather forecasts of Yr
   service. It will present the cornerstone of the irrigation scheduling
   service in AgroSense.rs, the Serbian national platform for digital

Title = {Evaluation of FDR MI2X and New WiTu Technology sensors to determine soil
   water content in the corn and weed field},
Journal = {AIMS AGRICULTURE AND FOOD},

Abstract = {Accurate determination of soil water contents (SWC) is crucially
   important in many scientific fields, particularly in agriculture. In
   this study, the performance of conventional FDR MI2X and New WiTu
   Technology water sensors was statistically evaluated under the impact of
   changing vegetative cover type (corn and weeds). A three replicated
   randomized complete block design (RCBD) field experiment was conducted
   from late April to August, 2019. The spring corn Nongda- 1505 variety
   was planted and the field was left unsown to allow weeds to grow. To
   determine the SWC, six WiTu Technology sensors were installed in the
   middle of each plot. For FDR sensor measurements, PVC tubes were
   inserted at 30 cm distance from WiTu sensors and soil samples from the
   0-20 cm, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm depths were taken using soil sampling
   auger for measurement of gravimetric water content. Both FDR and new
   Technology of WiTu sensors showed varied performance as soil depth
   increased from the top layer to deep layer. FDR efficiency was
   significantly high at the topsoil layer (0-20 cm) with an average
   accuracy level of 98.01\% and reduced in the middle soil layer to
   91.78\%, then increased to 95.13\% in the deep soil layer. While, the
   average accuracy of the WiTu Technology sensor ranged 98.24\%, 95.85\%
   and 92.02\% for top, middle and deep soil layers, respectively, these
   results demonstrate that the soil water detection ability of WiTu
   Technology is high at the soil depth of 0-40 cm, whereas FDR's ability
   to detect SWC changes is satisfactory in top to deep layers and low in
   the middle layer. Furthermore, the FDR showed good consistency with WiTu
   in all soil layers of the corn field, but there was a larger error for
   the weed field, which indicated a huge difference in the data measured
   by FDR and WiTu Technology. The SWC estimation of FDR and WiTu
   technology more fluctuated with changing vegetation cover type. Thus,
   the findings of this study provide an opportunity to further study on
   FDR MI2X and New WiTu Technology sensors for deep-rooted crops under the
   soil and climatic conditions of Zhengzhou, China.},

Abstract = {Water resource planning and management necessitates understanding soil
   moisture changes with depth in the root zone at the farm scale. For
   measuring soil moisture, remote sensing methods have been relatively
   successful. Soil moisture is estimated from image data, using in situ
   moisture and an empirical scattering model via regression fit analysis.
   However, in situ sensor data are prone to misinterpretations, requiring
   verification. Herein, we aimed at investigating the application of soil
   moisture from the water balance model towards verification of in situ
   soil moisture sensor data before in situ data was assessed for its
   relationship with remote sensing data. In situ soil moisture sensor data
   was obtained at 10 and 30 cm, and CROPWAT8.0 furnished root zone soil
   moisture data. The correlation between the in situ soil moisture at 10
   and 30 cm was 0.78; the correlation between the soil moisture from
   CROPWAT8.0 and the in situ soil moisture were 0.64 and 0.62 at 10 and 30
   cm, respectively. The R-2 between Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficients
   and in situ moisture were 0.74 and 0.68 at each depth, respectively.
   Therefore, the water balance model could verify sensor results before
   assessing in situ soil moisture data for relationship with remote
   sensing data.},

   Distributed Hydrological Model for Streamflow Simulation},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the increased availability of remote sensing products, more
   hydrological variables (e.g., soil moisture and evapotranspiration)
   other than streamflow data are introduced into the calibration procedure
   of a hydrological model. However, how the incorporation of these
   hydrological variables influences the calibration results remains
   unclear. This study aims to analyze the impact of remote sensing soil
   moisture data in the joint calibration of a distributed hydrological
   model. The investigation was carried out in Qujiang and Ganjiang
   catchments in southern China, where the Dem-based Distributed
   Rainfall-runoff Model (DDRM) was calibrated under different calibration
   schemes where the streamflow data and the remote sensing soil moisture
   are assigned to different weights in the objective function. The remote
   sensing soil moisture data are from the SMAP L3 soil moisture product.
   The results show that different weights of soil moisture in the
   objective function can lead to very slight differences in simulation
   performance of soil moisture and streamflow. Besides, the joint
   calibration shows no apparent advantages in terms of streamflow
   simulation over the traditional calibration using streamflow data only.
   More studies including various remote sensing soil moisture products are
   necessary to access their effect on the joint calibration.},

Abstract = {A good understanding of the levels and distribution patterns of soil
   properties and/or quality indicators is a prerequisite for developing
   sustainable agricultural land management programs. Traditional
   assessments of these parameters of soil fertility status are somewhat
   costly, in both economics and time aspects. Different modelling
   techniques have been proposed as a useful tool for determination of soil
   quality indicators and development of soil fertility maps, but to what
   extent these results are reliable remains under-quantified in many
   regions worldwide. To address this uncertainty, Fuzzy-Analytical
   Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) and Parametric analyses were conducted to
   ascertain the soil fertility status of a semiarid region in the
   Northeast of Iran for some selected crops: alfalfa, corn silage, potato,
   sugar beet, tomato and wheat. The Fuzzy-AHP and Parametric techniques
   using soil suitability indices were estimated for each crop and each
   soil delineation was achieved by Ordinary Kriging. The Technique for
   Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used as
   a compensatory method to allow tradeoffs among the selected criteria.
   Our results demonstrated that from the Fuzzy-AHP analysis, the soil
   fertility indices ranged from moderate to high for production of
   alfalfa; from low to high for production of corn silage and sugar beet;
   moderate to high for production of potato and tomato; and from low to
   moderate for production of wheat. However, the parametric analysis
   showed soil fertility classes ranging from very low to high for
   production of all the selected crops. High correlations were also
   observed between soil fertility indices predicted by both models.
   Similarly, the capacities of both models to predict soil fertility
   status for production of the selected crops were also highly correlated.
   The preference for the cultivation of the selected crops based on the
   Fuzzy-AHP analysis was sugar beet > corn silage > wheat > alfalfa >
   tomato > potato. On the other hand, using Parametric techniques, the
   crops preferences for cultivation ranked as corn silage > wheat >
   alfalfa > sugar beet > tomato > potato. We concluded that the findings
   would help to develop sustainable plans of cultivation based on patterns
   related to soil fertility classes depending on each crop's requirement.},

Abstract = {The ``dual probe heat pulse{''} (DPHP) method using actively heated
   fiber optic (AHFO) cables combined with distributed temperate sensing
   (DTS) technology has been developed for monitoring thermal properties
   and soil water content at the field scale. Field scale application,
   however, requires the use of robust and thicker fiber optic cables,
   corroborating the assumption of an infinite thin heat source in the
   evaluation process. We therefore included a semi-analytical solution of
   the heat transport equation into the evaluation procedure in order to
   consider the finite thermal properties of the heating cable without a
   calibration procedure to estimate effective thermal properties of the
   soil. To test this new evaluation procedure, we conducted a laboratory
   experiment and tested different heating scenarios to infer soil moisture
   from volumetric heat capacity. Estimates were made by analyzing the
   shift of the temperature amplitude at the sensing cable and the
   characteristics of the response heating curve. The results were compared
   with results from the calibrated infinite line source solution and in
   situ water content point measurements and showed a good approximation of
   thermal properties for strong and short heat pulses. Volumetric water
   content estimates are similarly accurate to the results of the
   calibrated infinite line source solution. Problems arose with the cable

Title = {Optimising landslide initiation modelling with high-resolution
   saturation prediction based on soil moisture monitoring data},
Journal = {LANDSLIDES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 4},
Abstract = {It has been widely recognised that the degree of soil wetness before
   precipitation events can be decisive for whether or not shallow
   rainfall-induced landslides occur. While there are methods to measure
   and/or model soil wetness in complex topography, they often exhibit
   limitations in spatial or temporal resolution, hindering their
   application in regional landside initiation modelling. In this study, we
   address the need for high-resolution predictions of initial saturation
   before rainfall events by employing data-driven linear regression
   models. The models were trained using in-situ soil moisture data
   collected from six measurement stations located in a landslide-prone
   region in Switzerland. Various topographic attributes, along with
   multiple antecedent rainfall and evapotranspiration variables were
   tested as input for the models. The final model consisted of five
   measurable variables, including cumulative antecedent rainfall,
   cumulative evapotranspiration, and the topographic wetness index (TWI).
   The model effectively reproduced the observed spatial and temporal
   variability of the in-situ measurements with a coefficient of
   determination R2 = 0.62 and a root mean square error RMSE = 0.07.
   Subsequently, we applied the regression model to predict the spatial
   soil saturation at the onset of actual landslide triggering rainfall
   events and integrated these patterns into the hydromechanical model
   STEP-TRAMM. The results demonstrate improvements in predicting observed
   landslide occurrences compared to simulations assuming spatially uniform
   initial saturation conditions, highlighting the importance of in-situ
   measurements and a realistic extrapolation of such data in space and
   time for accurate modelling of shallow landslide initiation.},

Title = {Advancements in the Temperature-Soil Moisture Dryness Index (TMDI) for
   Drought Monitoring in Southwestern Taiwan},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Abstract = {Drought, a destructive natural disaster, poses a significant threat to
   vulnerable areas worldwide. Its occurrence in Taiwan brings up concerns,
   particularly for vital sectors, such as the high-end semiconductor chip
   industry. Many satellite-based indexes have been developed to monitor
   the drought. The temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), a commonly
   used drought index, uses an empirical simplification of land surface
   temperature (LST) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The newly
   developed temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) using the
   LST-normalized difference latent heat index (NDLI) space is regarded as
   an alternative to TVDI due to its improved ability in vegetation-sparse
   areas. This article presents advancements in the TMDI using the novel
   fractional surface water availability (FSWA) derived from the NDLI, with
   an emphasis on enhanced edge selection in the LST-FSWA trapezoidal space
   for observing drought states. An effective method has been used to
   select the dry and wet edges within this trapezoid. The ability of the
   indexes was evaluated using indicators, including the surface energy
   balance algorithm for land (SEBAL)-based crop water stress index (CWSI)
   and evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), and in
   situ precipitation. The results show high correlations (r) between the
   TVDI and both CWSI and ET, with r values of 0.85 and -0.83,
   respectively. The TMDI reveals even stronger relationships with CWSI (r
   = 0.93) and ET (r = -0.94) and is more sensitive than individual
   variables (FVC, FSWA, and LST) and TVDI. It also indicates a high
   correlation between the TVDI and GPP (r = -0.69), while the TMDI
   displays a higher correlation with GPP (r = -0.75). Based on the
   spatiotemporal analysis, the TMDI was spatially well-matched with CWSI
   and GPP across most of the study area. Compared to other indexes, the
   TMDI exhibits the highest sensitivity to precipitation (r = -0.60). By
   leveraging the CWSI classification, a new TMDI threshold is proposed to
   assess drought status in southwestern Taiwan during the fourth quarter
   of the years 2014-2021. Overall, the TMDI accurately captures
   spatiotemporal variations in drought status, providing valuable insights
   for irrigation managers to effectively manage limited water resources.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to develop a horizontally elongated time
   domain reflectometry (HETDR) system to evaluate the water content in
   nonuniformly wetted soils. The HETDR probe consists of three rods of
   stainless steel and a cuboid head: A center electrode and two outer
   electrodes are connected to the inner and outer conductors of a coaxial
   cable, respectively. An acrylic container divided into several segments
   was used to prepare nonuniformly wetted soils with different water
   contents for a series of model tests. The HETDR probe was placed
   horizontally at the middle height of each soil specimen, while a
   conventional time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe was applied
   vertically on the surface of the specimen. The experimental results show
   that as the soil water content (SWC) at a segment increases, the average
   amplitude decreases and the duration increases. The estimated SWC
   increases with the measured SWC, and especially, the difference between
   actual segment length and the segment length estimated from the HETDR
   probes is significant under dry conditions. This study demonstrates that
   HETDR may be a promising field-testing method for evaluating the average
   water content in nonuniformly wetted soils.},

Title = {An Enhanced Saline Soil Dielectric Constant Model Used for Remote
   Sensing Soil Moisture and Salinity Retrieval},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The soil dielectric constant model is essential for retrieving soil
   properties based on microwave remote sensing. However, the existing
   saline soil dielectric constant models perform poorly in simulating the
   dielectric constant of soil with high water content and salinity. In
   this study, the Wang Yueru (WYR) saline soil dielectric constant model,
   which was demonstrated to perform well in describing the effect of
   salinity and moisture on the dielectric constant, was validated based on
   experimental measurements of soil samples under different water content
   and salinity degrees. Furthermore, we adjusted the model form, refitted
   the empirical coefficient in the model, and finally acquired a two-stage
   model for simulating the soil dielectric constant. The enhanced model
   was validated under different soil moisture and salinity ranges using
   experimental measurements of soil samples. Compared to the original
   model, the proposed model exhibits a larger improvement in simulating
   the soil dielectric constant, and the RMSE of the simulated results
   dramatically decreased from 7.3 to 1.6, especially for soil with high
   salinity and water content. On this basis, a model suitable for L-band
   microwave was established. This model is of great significance for
   studying soil dielectric characteristics and retrieving soil parameters
   based on L-band data. Furthermore, this model can be used to retrieve
   soil salinity and water content using microwave remote sensing under a
   broadened application situation, such as in saline-alkali soils,
   wetlands, and salt marshes.},

Title = {Remote Sensing-Informed Zonation for Understanding Snow, Plant and Soil
   Moisture Dynamics within a Mountain Ecosystem},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {In the headwater catchments of the Rocky Mountains, plant productivity
   and its dynamics are largely dependent upon water availability, which is
   influenced by changing snowmelt dynamics associated with climate change.
   Understanding and quantifying the interactions between snow, plants and
   soil moisture is challenging, since these interactions are highly
   heterogeneous in mountainous terrain, particularly as they are
   influenced by microtopography within a hillslope. Recent advances in
   satellite remote sensing have created an opportunity for monitoring snow
   and plant dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions that can capture
   microtopographic effects. In this study, we investigate the
   relationships among topography, snowmelt, soil moisture and plant
   dynamics in the East River watershed, Crested Butte, Colorado, based on
   a time series of 3-meter resolution PlanetScope normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) images. To make use of a large volume of
   high-resolution time-lapse images (17 images total), we use unsupervised
   machine learning methods to reduce the dimensionality of the time lapse
   images by identifying spatial zones that have characteristic NDVI time
   series. We hypothesize that each zone represents a set of similar
   snowmelt and plant dynamics that differ from other identified zones and
   that these zones are associated with key topographic features, plant
   species and soil moisture. We compare different distance measures (Ward
   and complete linkage) to understand the effects of their influence on
   the zonation map. Results show that the identified zones are associated
   with particular microtopographic features; highly productive zones are
   associated with low slopes and high topographic wetness index, in
   contrast with zones of low productivity, which are associated with high
   slopes and low topographic wetness index. The zones also correspond to
   particular plant species distributions; higher forb coverage is
   associated with zones characterized by higher peak productivity combined
   with rapid senescence in low moisture conditions, while higher sagebrush
   coverage is associated with low productivity and similar senescence
   patterns between high and low moisture conditions. In addition, soil
   moisture probe and sensor data confirm that each zone has a unique soil
   moisture distribution. This cluster-based analysis can tractably analyze
   high-resolution time-lapse images to examine plant-soil-snow
   interactions, guide sampling and sensor placements and identify areas
   likely vulnerable to ecological change in the future.},

Title = {Soil moisture content estimation in winter wheat planting area for
   multi-source sensing data using CNNR},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {193},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Rapid and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is an
   important part of precision agriculture, and it is also one of the key
   problems to be solved in field real-time monitoring and precision
   irrigation. Most of the existing studies are limited to SMC monitoring
   of bare soil, which can be obtained by optical remote sensing (e.g.,
   multispectral, hyperspectral) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR).
   However, for the soil covered by vegetation, such as farmland, there are
   some theoretical defects with only one of the measuring methods.
   Meanwhile, in order to break through the limitations of low spatial and
   temporal resolutions of satellite remote sensing, it is of great
   significance to study SMC retrieval based on multi-source remote sensing
   data for the near earth UAV remote sensing systems. Based on this, this
   paper, taking the winter wheat planting area in Guanzhong plain of China
   as the research area, combines the advantages of ultra-wideband (UWB)
   radar, and multispectral remote sensing data, to reduce the influences
   of vegetation coverage on the estimation accuracy. A one-dimensional
   regression convolution neural network model is constructed to realize
   the quantitative prediction and estimation of SMC in farmland. The
   carried out experiments show that the proposed CNNR model has a better
   performance than traditional SVR and GRNN models and the R-2, RMSE and
   RPD are 0.7453, 0.0140 cm(3)/cm(3) and 1.9246, respectively. After
   introducing NDVI, MSAVI and DVI vegetation indices generated from
   multispectral images, the accuracy of the three models increased
   significantly. Among the three models, the constructed CNNR model has
   the best performance, and its R-2, RMSE and RPD reach 0.9168, 0.0089
   cm(3)/cm(3), and 3.0201. Furthermore, after adding different levels of
   Gaussian noise to the original radar echoes, the CNNR model constructed
   in this paper still has the highest prediction accuracy and the
   strongest noise robustness.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to retrieve daily composite soil
   moisture by jointly using brightness temperature observations from
   multiple operating satellites for near real-time application with better
   coverage and higher accuracy. Our approach was to first apply the
   single-channel brightness radiometric algorithm to estimate soil
   moisture from the respective brightness temperature observations of the
   SMAP, SMOS, AMSR2, FY3B, and FY3C satellites on the same day and then
   produce a daily composite dataset by averaging the individual
   satellite-retrieved soil moisture. We further evaluated our product, the
   official soil moisture products of the five satellites, and the ensemble
   mean (i.e., arithmetic mean) of the five official satellite soil
   moisture products against ground observations from two networks in
   Central Tibet and Anhui Province, China. The results show that our
   product outperforms the individual released products of the five
   satellites and their ensemble means in the two validation areas. The
   root mean square error (RMSE) values of our product were 0.06 and 0.09
   m(3)/m(3) in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. Relative to
   the ensemble mean of the five satellite products, our product improves
   the accuracy by 9.1\% and 57.7\% in Central Tibet and Anhui Province,
   respectively. This demonstrates that jointly using brightness
   temperature observations from multiple satellites to retrieve soil
   moisture not only improves the spatial coverage of daily observations
   but also produces better daily composite products. (C) 2019 Hohai

Abstract = {Soil moisture controls the exchange of energy between the land surface

   content (SMC) could provide a theoretical basis for the real-time

   this study, we have developed SMC prediction models in different soil
   moisture ranges by using the combination of spectral preprocessing
   methods and optimized spectral indices. Results indicated that
   first-order derivative (FD) preprocessing method can highlight the
   effective information of the spectra and improve the correlation between
   spectral reflectance and SMC. The spectral reflectance exhibited a
   strong correlation with SMC near 1400, 1700, 1900, and 2200 nm. The
   FD-NDSI-W0-model had the best SMC prediction and applicability (R-2 =
   0.977, root mean square error = 3.413\%, relative percent deviation =
   6.171) to predict SMCs. Overall, pretreatment methods, combined with the

Abstract = {The `effective' root depth of perennial ryegrass used for irrigation

   lysimeters with diameters and heights of 500 and 900 mm, respectively,

   evapotranspiration (ETr) was estimated based on the CropWat 8 model.
   Perennial ryegrass height (h cm) was measured for each lysimeter. Among
   the three soil depths, 500 mm produced the highest regression
   coefficient for the crop coefficient (K-c = ETa/ETr) and h relationship.
   The results indicate the need to consider a 500 mm root depth to
   estimate irrigation requirements on this farm to achieve optimal water
   productivity. A noticeable fluctuation in daily soil water content for

   duration, severity, and frequency were appraised on a grid basis using
   the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI). The results show that the
   SSI values calculated based on these two SM products are significantly
   correlated (p < 0.05) over most parts (70\%) of China, with similar
   patterns of average drought duration, severity, and frequency. The
   duration and severity at the arid and semiarid regions (with duration
   over 3 months; with an average severity of -3.1) are generally higher
   than those over humid regions (with the duration of 2 months; with an
   average severity of -2.7), but both SM datasets show higher drying
   trends in humid regions. However, the two SM datasets exhibit large
   discrepancies in the spatial patterns of drought duration, severity, and
   frequency trends, especially in arid and cold regions. Both SM products
   are capable of monitoring extreme drought events reported in
   southwestern, southern, and northern China compared with the

Abstract = {New sensing technologies are at the cusp of providing state-of-the-art

   project aimed to develop a new smart irrigation system that uses an

   moisture information. A potato farm was selected due to its sensitivity
   to water and an existing irrigation system where the radiometer could be
   mounted. A field experiment was conducted to capture the soil moisture
   variation across the farm using the radiometer. A greenhouse trial was
   also conducted to mimic the actual growth of potatoes by controlling the
   soil moisture and exploring the impact on their growth. It was found
   that 0.3 cm(3)/cm(3) was the optimal moisture level in terms of
   productivity. Moreover, it was demonstrated that on-farm soil moisture
   maps could be generated with an RMSE of 0.044 cm(3)/cm(3). It is
   anticipated that through such technology, a real-time watering map will
   be generated, which will then be passed to the irrigation software to

Title = {Error Estimation for Soil Moisture Measurements With Cosmic Ray Neutron
   Sensing and Implications for Rover Surveys},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) sensing allows for non-invasive soil moisture
   measurements at the field scale and relies on the inverse correlation
   between aboveground measured epithermal neutron intensity (1 eV-100 keV)
   and environmental water content. The measurement uncertainty follows
   Poisson statistics and thus increases with decreasing neutron intensity,
   which corresponds to increasing soil moisture. In order to reduce
   measurement uncertainty, the neutron count rate is usually aggregated
   over 12 or 24 h time windows for stationary CRN probes. To obtain
   accurate soil moisture estimates with mobile CRN rover applications, the
   aggregation of neutron measurements is also necessary and should
   consider soil wetness and driving speed. To date, the optimization of
   spatial aggregation of mobile CRN observations in order to balance
   measurement accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture patterns
   has not been investigated in detail. In this work, we present and apply
   an easy-to-use method based on Gaussian error propagation theory for
   uncertainty quantification of soil moisture measurements obtained with
   CRN sensing. We used a 3(rd) order Taylor expansion for estimating the
   soil moisture uncertainty from uncertainty in neutron counts and
   compared the results to a Monte Carlo approach with excellent agreement.
   Furthermore, we applied our method with selected aggregation times to
   investigate how CRN rover survey design affects soil moisture estimation
   uncertainty. We anticipate that the new approach can be used to improve
   the strategic planning and evaluation of CRN rover surveys based on
   uncertainty requirements.},

   model. Time-lapse sections of percentage resistivity changes show
   spatial and temporal overall consistency with seasonal variations of
   soil temperature. Discrepancies are likely due to the pavement layer
   that is not well considered in the inversion process as well as to
   time-lapse inversion pitfalls. Furthermore, a detailed estimation of
   seasonal moisture content variations could not be given as an accurate
   calibration of the employed suction probes was not achievable.
   Nevertheless, the levee appears to have spatially consistent time
   variations in soil moisture, clearly influenced by both rainfall and
   water table and river levels. Future work on developing 3D acquisitions
   and adding embedded moisture content probes should prove effective to
   our monitoring design and give a more detailed understanding of the soil
   moisture seasonal behaviour in the studied stretch of levee. (C) 2019

Abstract = {The change in Soil Moisture Content (SMC) is one of the most crucial
   variables for regulating and analyzing basic hydrological processes,
   including runoff, evaporation, carbon and energy cycles, infiltration of
   water resources, droughts and floods, and desertification. This study
   aimed to detect and map the global SMC change using microwave remote
   sensing observations. Monthly SMC data from the Soil Moisture Ocean
   Salinity (SMOS) with a spatial resolution of 25 km were used to assess
   the SMC change from January 2010 to December 2021. Various trend
   patterns, including linear, quadratic, cubic, and concealed, were
   examined by applying a parametric polynomial fitting-based algorithm
   (Polytrend). In particular, approximately 16.93\% of global land is
   subjected to soil moisture dynamics, of which 8.33\% has become drier
   and 8.60\% has become wetter. Both linear and nonlinear trends were
   observed in the global land areas that have experienced statistically
   significant changes. The concealed and linear trends were however the
   dominant trend patterns globally. The obtained trend results were
   further investigated using a well-known non-parametric trend test,
   Mann-Kendall, which showed 93.20\% agreement, demonstrating the
   robustness and reliability of the observed trends.},

Abstract = {The multisatellite-retrieved soil moisture (SM) products released by the
   Europe Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) program have
   been widely used in numerous fields, including drought monitoring. In
   this article, a cumulative distribution function is applied to match the
   simulated SM from the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model and
   fill in the missing records of ESA CCI SM. The weekly standard SM index
   (SSI) calculated from the ESA CCI SM dataset is utilized to monitor the
   agricultural drought over the Yellow River Basin (YRB) during 2000-2012.
   The performance of the ESA CCI SSI is compared with the Standard
   Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration
   Index (SPEI), the self-calibrating Palmer Drought Severity Index based
   on VIC model (VIC-scPDSI) and the anomalies of ESA CCI SM and Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The results show that the
   interpolated ESA CCI SM is significantly (p < 0.05) correlated with the
   observed SM, and more than 84\% of the grids in the YRB display strong
   correlations with the global reanalysis SM. ESA CCI SSI presents a
   similar spatiotemporal pattern as VIC-scPDSI, while exhibiting a
   significantly delayed response to SPI and SPEI. The average residence
   time of drought reflected by ESA CCI SSI from short periods of extreme
   drought and long periods of less extreme drought are above 1 week and 3
   weeks later than that represented by SPI and SPEI. Severe and extreme
   drought areas detected by ESA CCI SSI are generally larger than that
   captured by SPI, SPEI, and VIC-scPDSI.},

   Using MODIS and Landsat-8 Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {MAY 29},
Abstract = {As the fundamental regulator of energy exchange in the
   vegetation-soil-atmosphere circulation system, soil moisture is a key
   parameter for drought monitoring and is indispensable to the land
   surface hydrological processes. In order to overcome the constraints of
   the Perpendicular Drought Index, PDI (performs poorly over the fields
   with dense vegetation and hard to construct the soil line), and the
   Temperature Vegetation Drought Index, TVDI (requires similar atmospheric
   forcing and large enough dimension of mapping area), in soil moisture
   monitoring, a new drought index (Normalized Temperature Drought Index,
   NTDI) is proposed to explore the spatiotemporal changes of soil moisture
   by substituting red and near-infrared reflectances with vegetation index
   and normalized land surface temperature on the basis of the PDI
   framework. Victoria, Australia, was selected as the study area as it
   experiences many severe droughts and has been affected for more than ten
   years. Time series of satellite-based data were applied to evaluate the
   effectiveness and applicability of the NTDI at the regional scale.
   Results indicated that the expression of the soil line representing the
   water condition of the bare soil is easier to obtain in the new
   trapezoid framework and has good fits with the coefficients of
   determination (R-2) of more than 0.8. Compared with PDI, TVDI and
   Modified PDI (MPDI) at the cropping sites, NTDI exhibits a relatively
   better performance in soil moisture monitoring for most days where the
   R-2 achieved can reach to more than 0.7 on DOY 242, 254 and 272.
   Meanwhile, spatial-temporal mappings of the four drought indices from
   satellite data were conducted, and the NTDI presented the slightly
   seasonal variation and effectively described the real spatial
   characteristics of regional drought. Overall, the NTDI seems to a viable
   approach and can provide insight into spatial and temporal soil moisture
   monitoring at different scales.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at three depths (15, 25, and 30 cm), derived from the
   optical trapezoidal model (OPTRAM), was used for multiyear, multisite
   monitoring of agricultural droughts over two agricultural crops (Maize
   and Soybean) in southern Mozambique. The OPTRAM was implemented using
   satellite data from Sentinel-2 and was validated against field SM
   assessed by gravimetric methods and by Watermark Sensors in sandy-soils
   with very low water holding capacity (0.13 cm(3)/cm(3)). The OPTRAM
   model estimated the SM at 15 and 25 cm yielding a R-2 >= 0.79 and RMSE
   <= 0.030 cm(3)/cm(3). The OPTRAM-derived SM was successfully used as
   input to compute and map the soil water deficit index, an indicator of
   agricultural drought. The results indicate that OPTRAM can provide
   useful information to improve water productivity in cropland under the
   specific conditions of Mozambique agricultural systems and for early

   Root-Zone SMAR Model},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Monitoring Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) and Root Zone Soil Moisture
   (RZSM) dynamics at the regional scale is of fundamental importance to
   many hydrological and ecological studies. This need becomes even more
   critical in arid and semi-arid regions, where there are a lack of in
   situ observations. In this regard, satellite-based Soil Moisture (SM)
   data is promising due to the temporal resolution of acquisitions and the
   spatial coverage of observations. Satellite-based SM products are only
   able to estimate moisture from the soil top layer; however, linking SSM
   with RZSM would provide valuable information on land surface-atmosphere
   interactions. In the present study, satellite-based SSM data from Soil
   Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are first
   compared with the few available SM in situ observations, and are then
   coupled with the Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) model to
   estimate RZSM in Iran. The comparison between in situ SM observations
   and satellite data showed that the SMAP satellite products provide more
   accurate description of SSM with an average correlation coefficient (R)
   of 0.55, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.078 m(3) m(-3) and a Bias of
   0.033 m(3)( )m(-3). Thereafter, the SMAP satellite products were coupled
   with SMAR model, providing a description of the RZSM with performances
   that are strongly influenced by the misalignment between point and pixel
   processes measured in the preliminary comparison of SSM data.},

Volume = {41},
Number = {20},
Pages = {8034-8047},

Abstract = {Optical remote sensing of earth surface processes commonly relies on the
   red, green, blue (RGB), near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared
   (SWIR) electromagnetic bands. Most of the optical sensors mounted on
   unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites provide the RGB and NIR bands,
   but only a few offer SWIR output. The Red-NIR reflectance space has been
   widely applied for remote sensing of various land surface variables
   including soil moisture. The linear relationship between the Red-NIR
   reflectance of bare soil is established as the base and then moisture
   isolines are assumed perpendicular to the soil line. In this study, we
   show that this assumption is not consistent with the actual Red-NIR
   space geometry, which in many cases introduces soil moisture estimation
   errors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new mathematical
   transformation to the original Red-NIR space followed by newly defined
   soil moisture isolines that are more consistent with the actual
   observations. This new Transformed Red-NIR (TRN) model is compared with
   the Conventional Red-NIR (CRN) model using data from a sugarcane field
   located in southwestern Iran. Twelve Land Remote-Sensing Satellite
   (Landsat)-8 images were acquired during the sugarcane growth season. For
   validation of the remotely sensed data, ground reference soil moisture
   was determined at 22 locations at five different depths via core
   sampling and oven-drying. Our results indicate that the TRN model
   significantly improves the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture.},

Title = {Exploiting High-Resolution Remote Sensing Soil Moisture to Estimate
   Irrigation Water Amounts over a Mediterranean Region},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Despite irrigation being one of the main sources of anthropogenic water
   consumption, detailed information about water amounts destined for this
   purpose are often lacking worldwide. In this study, a methodology which
   can be used to estimate irrigation amounts over a pilot area in Spain by
   exploiting remotely sensed soil moisture is proposed. Two
   high-resolution DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And
   Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled soil moisture products have been
   used: SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity) at 1 km. The irrigation estimates have been obtained
   through the SM2RAIN algorithm, in which the evapotranspiration term has
   been improved to adequately reproduce the crop evapotranspiration over
   irrigated areas according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization)
   model. The experiment exploiting the SMAP data at 1 km represents the
   main work analyzed in this study and covered the period from January
   2016 to September 2017. The experiment with the SMOS data at 1 km, for
   which a longer time series is available, allowed the irrigation
   estimates to be extended back to 2011. For both of the experiments
   carried out, the proposed method performed well in reproducing the
   magnitudes of the irrigation amounts that actually occurred in four of
   the five pilot irrigation districts. The SMAP experiment, for which a
   more detailed analysis was performed, also provided satisfactory results
   in representing the spatial distribution and the timing of the
   irrigation events. In addition, the investigation into which term of the
   SM2RAIN algorithm plays the leading role in determining the amount of
   water entering into the soil highlights the importance of correct
   representation of the evapotranspiration process.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time, and deficits (i.e.,
   droughts) play an important role in modulating crop yields. Limited
   hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring
   and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the
   potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support
   high-resolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at
   the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling
   approach that combines HydroBlocks - a physically based hyper-resolution
   land surface model (LSM) - with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to
   simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h
   30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed
   vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical
   landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined
   with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to
   predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model
   predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination
   (R-2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kg ha(-1) using
   year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the
   2015-2016 El Nino drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food
   and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil
   moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield,
   driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a
   more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation,
   soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices. This study demonstrates
   how field-scale modeling can help bridge the spatial-scale gap between
   drought monitoring and agricultural impacts.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING APPLICATIONS-SOCIETY AND ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {33},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The Northeast region of Brazil, particularly the Brazilian semiarid
   region (BSR), is frequently affected by drought events, such as the
   great drought that started in 2012 and is considered one of the most
   severe droughts in recent decades. Monitoring and quantifying this type
   of event is essential for decision-making and the adoption of impact
   mitigation strategies. In this study, re-motely sensed soil moisture
   (SM) data from three products derived from Soil Moisture and Ocean
   Salinity (SMOS-CATDS and SMOS-IC) and Soil Moisture Active Passive
   (SMAP) were validated in the BSR using a dense network of in situ
   stations (N = 120) from 2015 to 2020. Subsequently, the best product was
   selected for the evaluation of agricultural drought, based on the Soil
   Water Deficit Index (SWDI), which was compared with the Atmospheric
   Water Deficit (AWD) obtained from in situ data (N = 50). After
   validation, SMAP was selected as the best product for estimating SM in
   the BSR, and SWDI-SMAP showed a strong temporal correlation with AWD.
   Based on these two indices, the results indicate the severity of drought
   in the BSR during the evaluated period, with significant social and
   economic impacts, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring,
   especially to support family farming, which is predominant in the
   region.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an essential role in geoscience
   research. The SMC can be retrieved using an artificial neural network
   (ANN) based on remote sensing data. The quantity and quality of samples
   for ANN training and testing are two critical factors that affect the
   SMC retrieving results. This study focused on sample optimization in
   both quantity and quality. On the one hand, a sparse sample exploitation
   (SSE) method was developed to solve the problem of sample scarcity,
   resultant from cloud obstruction in optical images and the malfunction
   of in situ SMC-measuring instruments. With this method, data typically
   excluded in conventional approaches can be adequately employed. On the
   other hand, apart from the basic input parameters commonly discussed in
   previous studies, a couple of new parameters were optimized to improve
   the feature description. The Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat-8 images were
   adopted to retrieve SMC in the study area in eastern Austria. By the SSE
   method, the number of available samples increased from 264 to 635 for
   ANN training and testing, and the retrieval accuracy could be markedly
   improved. Furthermore, the optimized parameters also improve the
   inversion effect, and the elevation was the most influential input
   parameter.},

Title = {The Indian COSMOS Network (ICON): Validating L-Band Remote Sensing and
   Modelled Soil Moisture Data Products},

Abstract = {Availability of global satellite based Soil Moisture (SM) data has
   promoted the emergence of many applications in climate studies,
   agricultural water resource management and hydrology. In this context,
   validation of the global data set is of substance. Remote sensing
   measurements which are representative of an area covering 100 m2 to tens
   of km2 rarely match with in situ SM measurements at point scale due to
   scale difference. In this paper we present the new Indian Cosmic Ray
   Network (ICON) and compare it's data with remotely sensed SM at
   different depths. ICON is the first network in India of the kind. It is
   operational since 2016 and consist of seven sites equipped with the
   COSMOS instrument. This instrument is based on the Cosmic Ray Neutron
   Probe (CRNP) technique which uses non-invasive neutron counts as a
   measure of soil moisture. It provides in situ measurements over an area
   with a radius of 150-250 m. This intermediate scale soil moisture is of
   interest for the validation of satellite SM. We compare the COSMOS
   derived soil moisture to surface soil moisture (SSM) and root zone soil
   moisture (RZSM) derived from SMOS, SMAP and GLDAS\_Noah. The comparison
   with surface soil moisture products yield that the SMAP\_L4\_SSM showed
   best performance over all the sites with correlation (R) values ranging
   from 0.76 to 0.90. RZSM on the other hand from all products showed
   lesser performances. RZSM for GLDAS and SMAP\_L4 products show that the
   results are better for the top layer R = 0.75 to 0.89 and 0.75 to 0.90
   respectively than the deeper layers R = 0.26 to 0.92 and 0.6 to 0.8
   respectively in all sites in India. The ICON network will be a useful
   tool for the calibration and validation activities for future SM
   missions like the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR).},

Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {213},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study aims to improve the accuracy and applicability of traditional
   linear regression and machine learning algorithms for monitoring soil
   moisture content by satellite remote sensing. Shahaoqu Experimental
   Station within Jiefangzha Irrigation District of Hetao Irrigation Area
   is selected as the study area. The dataset includes GF-1 satellite
   remote sensing images and measured soil moisture content. The study
   employs the best subset selection to determine the combination of
   sensitive variables for soil moisture content at different soil depths.
   Additionally, robust regression theory is introduced to traditional
   linear regression and machine learning algorithms to construct soil
   moisture content inversion models at different soil depths. The results
   show that all three improved robust algorithms effectively reduce the
   influence of outliers, improve the accuracy and stability of these
   inversion models. The improved robust nonlinear algorithm outperforms
   the improved robust linear algorithm. Compared with the unprocessed
   algorithm, at the soil depth of 0-20 cm, Robust Extreme Learning Machine
   (RELM) algorithm is the most optimal, with the validation set's R-adj(2)
   increasing from 0.555 to 0.696 (approximately 25.33\%) and the RMSE
   decreasing from 0.025 to 0.018 (approximately 26.54\%). Robust Least
   Squares Support Vector Machine (RLSSVM) algorithm is the second best,
   with the validation set's R-adj(2) increasing from 0.502 to 0.641
   (approximately 27.75\%) and the RMSE decreasing from 0.026 to 0.020
   (approximately 24.59\%). Robust Linear Regression (LMS-RLS) algorithm is
   relatively the worst, with the validation set's R-adj(2) increasing from
   0.491 to 0.659 (approximately 34.05\%) and the RMSE decreasing from
   0.026 to 0.019 (approximately 27.21\%). The sensitivity of the five soil
   depths to soil moisture content follows the order of 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm,
   0-60 cm, 0-40 cm, and 40-60 cm. The improved robust regression
   algorithms can improve the accuracy and applicability of soil moisture
   content estimation and provide a reference for monitoring soil moisture
   content using GF-1 satellite.},

Title = {Using regional characteristics to improve uncalibrated estimation of
   rootzone soil moisture from optical/thermal remote-sensing},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {273},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Remote-sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery
   have been proposed to estimate fine-resolution (30 m) rootzone soil
   moisture (theta) over bar. In these methods (theta) over bar. is most
   commonly estimated using a single empirical relationship with
   evaporative fraction Lambda(SEB) or evaporative index Lambda(PET).
   Methods have been proposed recently to estimate these relationships
   based on regional climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics, but
   those methods have not yet been applied to estimate (theta) over bar
   from remote sensing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate
   the. estimates from remote sensing when the Lambda(SEB) vs. (theta) over
   bar and Lambda(PET) vs. (theta) over bar relationships are inferred from
   regional characteristics using the previously proposed methods. Four
   study regions are considered including the Walnut Gulch Experimental
   Watershed in Arizona, the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site and Lower Arkansas
   River Valley in Colorado, the Little Washita and Fort Cobb Experimental
   Watersheds in Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Delta region in Mississippi.
   The (theta) over bar estimates from the regionally adapted relationships
   are compared to (theta) over bar estimates from the single empirical
   relationship and to in situ (theta) over bar measurements. The estimates
   from the regionally adapted relationships consistently outperform the
   estimates form the single empirical relationship. The performance
   typically improves as more regional information is used in the
   relationships and reduces the root mean squared error of (theta) over
   bar by an average of 45\% among the four regions. The regional method
   typically performs better for the arid and semiarid regions with root
   mean squared errors of 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3),
   respectively. The regionally adapted relationships better capture both
   spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture than the single
   empirical relationship.},

Title = {A soil moisture monitoring network to assess controls on runoff
   generation during atmospheric river events},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key modifier of runoff generation from rainfall
   excess, including during extreme precipitation events associated with
   Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This paper presents a new, publicly available
   dataset from a soil moisture monitoring network in Northern California's
   Russian River Basin, designed to assess soil moisture controls on runoff
   generation under AR conditions. The observations consist of 2-min
   volumetric soil moisture at 19 sites and 6 depths (5, 10, 15, 20, 50,
   and 100 cm), starting in summer 2017. The goals of this monitoring
   network are to aid the development of research applications and
   situational awareness tools for Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations
   at Lake Mendocino. We present short analyses of these data to
   demonstrate their capability to characterize soil moisture responses to
   precipitation across sites and depths, including time series analysis,
   correlation analysis, and identification of soil saturation thresholds
   that induce runoff. Our results show strong inter-site Pearson's
   correlations (>0.8) at the seasonal timescale. Correlations are strong
   (>0.8) during events with high antecedent soil moisture and during
   drydown periods, and weak (<0.5) otherwise. High event runoff ratios are
   observed when antecedent soil moisture thresholds are exceeded, and when
   antecedent runoff is high. Although local heterogeneity in soil moisture
   can limit the utility of point source data in some hydrologic model
   applications, our analyses indicate three ways in which soil moisture
   data are valuable for model design: (1) sensors installed at 6 depths
   per location enable us to identify the soil depth below which
   evapotranspiration and saturation dynamics change, and therefore choose
   model soil layer depths, (2) time series analysis indicates the role of
   soil moisture processes in controlling runoff ratio during
   precipitation, which hydrologic models should replicate, and (3) spatial
   correlation analysis of the soil moisture fluctuations helps identify
   when and where distributed hydrologic modelling may be beneficial.},

Title = {Micro-ridge-furrow soil moisture regulation technology improves seedling
   quality and yield of winter rapeseed},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {237},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop worldwide, and the
   Yangtze River Basin (YRB) region is one of the most vital rapeseeds
   producing areas in China. However, the uneven distribution of annual
   precipitation during the rapeseed seedling stage in this region often
   leads to droughts and waterlogging, resulting in declined rapeseed
   seedling quality and yield. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the
   impact of micro-ridge-furrow planting (MR) and conventional flat
   cropping planting (FC) under straw returning on rapeseed seedling growth
   and yield during two growing seasons: wet year (WY) and dry year (DY).
   In MR planting, rapeseed was sown either on the ridge surface (RS) or in
   the ridge furrow (RF). We found that MR planting had stronger regulation
   of soil temperature and humidity compared to FC. The average soil volume
   water content in RS was 19.2 \% lower than FC, while in RF, it was 9.0
   \% higher than FC. Under MR planting, the daily temperature fluctuations
   in RF were smaller than in FC, whereas in RS, they were larger than in
   FC. Through the adjustment of temperature and humidity, MR increased the
   activities of beta-glucosidase (beta-Glu) and cellulose disaccharide
   hydrolase (CBH) in the soil, thereby accelerating rice straw
   decomposition. Importantly, MR led to improved root growth, seedling
   quality, precipitation water use efficiency (WUEP), and yield of
   rapeseed during both the WY and DY seasons. Notably, root morphological
   traits were significantly altered under straw returning (RT) in MR,
   particularly with an 11.0 \% increase in root surface area, which showed
   a significant correlation with the indoleacetic acid and jasmonic acid
   contents in the root system. Furthermore, RT increased antioxidant
   enzymes activity in rapeseed roots. The H2O2 and center dot OH contents
   in MR were lower than in FC, indicating that the roots of MR were
   capable of self-protection and reducing the accumulation of superoxide
   radicals and peroxides by adapting actively to the soil water
   environment under straw returning. The yield and WUEP of MR were higher
   by 11.9 \% and 21.0 \%, respectively, compared to FC. In conclusion, MR
   planting has the potential to enhance seedling quality and increase
   rapeseed yield when combined with rice straw returning. This finding
   provides technical support for realizing the full and strong seedling
   establishment and improving the cultivation of directseeded rapeseed in
   the YRB region.},

Abstract = {Water and soil moisture management are very important factors in

   In addition, adequate moisture and suitable soil moisture can make the
   strawberry grow more healthily, thus improving its quality and reducing
   the occurrence of hollow fruit. Therefore, in strawberry cultivation,
   reasonable water and soil moisture management is very important, growers
   need to carry out timely irrigation and drainage according to the growth
   of strawberry, to ensure the growth and yield of strawberry. Its
   disadvantages include the following: vulnerable to diseases and pests,
   high requirements for climatic conditions, high requirements for
   climatic conditions and high production costs. As a new agricultural

Abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a remote sensing technique for mapping
   of soil moisture with high spatial resolution. C-band SAR can resolve
   features at field scale, or better, but responds to moisture only within
   the top 1 to 2 cm of the soil. When validating SAR-derived soil moisture
   products against standard in situ measurements at 5 to 10 cm depth, the
   greater moisture variability at the soil surface may be inaccurately
   categorized as measurement error. An alternative method was developed
   where the C-band SAR product is validated against soil moisture
   simulated at 2 cm depth by the HYDRUS-1D model. This reproduces soil
   moisture depth profiles from daily meteorological observations, leaf
   area index, and soil hydraulic parameters. The model was fitted at 13
   COSMOS-UK sites so that the model output at 10 cm depth closely
   reproduced the cosmic ray neutron sensor data. At ten of the sites
   studied, there was an improvement of up to 8\% in root-mean-squared
   difference by validating the Copernicus surface soil moisture (SSM)
   product at 2 cm compared to 10 cm. This suggests that Copernicus SSM and
   other C-band SAR surface soil moisture algorithms may be more accurate
   than have hitherto been acknowledged.},

Title = {Soil Moisture Inversion in Grassland Ecosystem Using Remote Sensing
   Considering Different Grazing Intensities and Growing Seasons},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Although vegetation community information such as grazing gradient,
   biomass, and density have been well characterized in typical grassland
   communities with Stipa grandis and Leymus chinensis as dominant species,
   their impact on the soil moisture (SM) inversion is still unclear. This
   study investigated the characteristics of a grassland vegetation
   community at different grazing gradients and growing seasons and its
   impact on SM inversion using remote sensing data. The water cloud model
   (WCM) was used for SM inversion, and both field and remote sensing data
   collected from 2019 to 2021 were used for calibration and prediction.
   The study found that the calibrated WCM achieved prediction results of
   SM inversion with average R-2 values of 0.41 and 0.38 at different
   grazing gradients and growing seasons, respectively. Vegetation biomass
   and height were significantly correlated with vegetation indexes, and
   the highest model prediction accuracy was achieved for biomass and
   height around 121.1 g/m(2) {[}102.3-139.9] and 18.6 cm {[}17.3-19.8],
   respectively. Generally, NDWI1 produced higher SM estimation accuracy
   than NDWI2. The growing season of vegetation also affects the accuracy
   of the WCM to retrieve SM, with the highest accuracy achieved in
   mid-growing season I. Therefore, the developed WCM with optimal height
   and biomass of vegetation communities can enhance the SM prediction
   capacity; it thus can be potentially used for SM prediction in typical
   grasslands.},

   Comparative Study of Interpolation Techniques},
Journal = {RESOURCES-BASEL},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soil moisture represents a vital component of the ecosystem, sustaining
   life-supporting activities at micro and mega scales. It is a highly
   required parameter that may vary significantly both spatially and
   temporally. Due to this fact, its estimation is challenging and often
   hard to obtain especially over large, heterogeneous surfaces. This study
   aimed at comparing the performance of four widely used interpolation
   methods in estimating soil moisture using GPS-aided information and
   remote sensing. The Distance Weighting (IDW), Spline, Ordinary Kriging
   models and Kriging with External Drift (KED) interpolation techniques
   were employed to estimate soil moisture using 82 soil moisture
   field-measured values. Of those measurements, data from 54 soil moisture
   locations were used for calibration and the remaining data for
   validation purposes. The study area selected was Varanasi City, India
   covering an area of 1535 km(2). The soil moisture distribution results
   demonstrate the lowest RMSE (root mean square error, 8.69\%) for KED, in
   comparison to the other approaches. For KED, the soil organic carbon
   information was incorporated as a secondary variable. The study results
   contribute towards efforts to overcome the issue of scarcity of soil
   moisture information at local and regional scales. It also provides an
   understandable method to generate and produce reliable spatial
   continuous datasets of this parameter, demonstrating the added value of
   geospatial analysis techniques for this purpose.},

Title = {A Remote Sensing Driven Soil Moisture Estimator: Uncertain Downscaling
   With Geostatistically Based Use of Ancillary Data},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In recent years, remote sensing satellites, including Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP), continuously monitor SM of the earth. However,
   the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed SM is insufficient for
   some hydrological applications. In this paper, a data-driven model is
   proposed based on a hybrid approach called artificial neural network
   kriging (ANNK) to capture the interaction between SM and ancillary data
   (AD), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), altitude,
   slope, Antecedent Moisture Condition, AMC (5-day cumulative
   precipitation), and daily air temperature (DAT)/land surface temperature
   (LST). By co-regionalization of the estimated SM from the ANNK and SMAP
   36-km product, SM in any part of the study area is estimated more
   accurately and on a finer resolution (1-km). Finally, through a linear
   relationship between in-situ SM with the up-to-date AD including AMC
   (previous 5-day cumulative precipitation), LST or DAT, slope, NDVI, and
   the downscaled satellite SM, the soil moisture estimates are adjusted by
   also adding an error term. Estimation of the final SM product in terms
   of the Unbiased Root Mean Square Error of less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3) meets

Title = {Novel Weighting Method for Evaluating Forest Soil Fertility Index: A
   Structural Equation Model},
Journal = {PLANTS-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Understanding nutrient quantity and quality in forest soils is important
   for sustainable management of forest resources and maintaining forest
   ecosystem services. In this study, six soil nutrient indicators,
   including soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total
   phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and
   available potassium (AK) were measured in five different aged stands of
   Chinese fir forests in subtropical China. A structural equation model
   (SEM) was developed based on these soil nutrients indicators in order to
   better evaluate the soil fertility index (SFI) in these studied forests.
   The results show that soil nutrient contents changed with the soil depth
   in different age groups. The SOM decreased in a specific order: over
   mature > mature > near mature > middle > young stands. The TN content of
   the soil gradually decreased with increased soil depth throughout all
   age groups. The SEM indicated that the TN had the highest weight of
   0.4154, while the TP had the lowest weight at 0.1991 for estimating the
   SFI. The weights of other indicators (AN, SOM, AP, and AK) ranged
   0.2138-0.3855 in our study. The established SEM satisfied the fitness
   reference values and was able to accurately describe the forest soil
   nutrient status through the SFI. The overall SFI values were
   significantly higher in over mature stands than in young-aged stands and
   in topsoil than in deeper soil in all examined forests. Soil TN, AP, and
   AK were the most important nutrient indicators to the evaluation of the
   SFI in the study sites. The results confirmed that the SEM was suitable
   to estimate the weights of the SFI and better describe the soil nutrient
   status in forests. Our research provides an innovative approach to
   assess a soil nutrient status and soil fertility and provides a
   scientific basis for accurate implementation of soil nutrient assessment
   in forest ecosystems.},

Title = {Estimating catchment scale soil moisture at a high spatial resolution:
   Integrating remote sensing and machine learning},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {776},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Soil moisture information is important for a wide range of applications
   including hydrologic modelling, climatic modelling and agriculture.
   L-band passivemicrowave satellite remote sensing is themost feasible
   option to estimate near-surface soil moisture (similar to 0-5 cmsoil
   depth) over large extents, but its coarse resolution (similar to 10s of
   km) means that it is unable to capture the variability of soil moisture
   in detail. Therefore, different downscaling methods have been tested as
   a solution tomeet the demand for high spatial resolution soil moisture.
   Downscaling algorithms based on the soil thermal inertia relationship
   between diurnal soil temperature difference (Delta T) and dailymean soil
   moisture content (mu(SM)) have shown promising results over arid and
   semi-arid landscapes. However, the linearity of these algorithms is
   affected by factors such as vegetation, soil texture and meteorology in
   a complex manner. This study tested a (i) Regression Tree (RT), an
   Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR)
   model based on the soil thermal inertia theory over a semi-arid
   agricultural landscape in Australia, given the ability of machine
   learning algorithms to capture complex, non-linear relationships between
   predictors and responses. Downscaled soil moisture from the RT, ANN and
   GPR models showed root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.03, 0.09 and 0.07
   cm(3)/cm(3) compared to airborne retrievals and unbiased RMSEs (ubRMSEs)
   of 0.07, 0.08 and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) compared to in-situ observations,
   respectively. The study showed encouraging results to integrate machine
   learning techniques in estimating near-surface soil moisture at a high
   spatial resolution. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Crop Growing Season},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is an indispensable basic element for crop
   growth and development in agricultural production. Obtaining accurate
   information on SMC in real time over large agricultural areas has
   important guiding significance for crop yield estimation and production
   management. In this study, the paper reports on the retrieval of SMC
   from RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data. The proposed SMC retrieval
   algorithm includes vegetation correction based on a ratio method and
   roughness correction based on the optimal roughness method. Three
   vegetation description parameters (i.e., RVI, LAI, and NDVI) serve as
   vegetation descriptors in the parameterization of the algorithm. To
   testify the vegetation correction result of the algorithm, the water
   cloud model (WCM) was compared with the algorithm. The calibrated
   integrated equation model (CIEM) was employed to describe the
   backscattering from the underlying soil. To improve the accuracy of SMC
   retrieval, the CIEM model was optimized by using the optimal roughness
   parameter and the normalization method of reference incidence angle.
   Validation against ground measurements showed a high correlation between
   the measured and estimated SMC when the NDVI serves as vegetation
   descriptor (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 4.15 vol.\%, p < 0.01). The overall
   estimation performance of the proposed SMC retrieval algorithm is better
   than that of the WCM. It demonstrates that the proposed algorithm has an
   operational potential to estimate SMC over wheat fields during the
   growing season.},

Title = {Evaluating Satellite Soil Moisture Datasets for Drought Monitoring in
   Australia and the South-West Pacific},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {16},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is critical in monitoring the time-lagged impacts of
   agrometeorological drought. In Australia and several south-west Pacific
   Small Island Developing States (SIDS), there are a limited number of in
   situ SM stations that can adequately assess soil-water availability in a
   near-real-time context. Satellite SM datasets provide a viable
   alternative for SM monitoring and agrometeorological drought provision
   in these regions. In this study, we investigated the performance of Soil
   Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS),
   Soil Moisture Operational Products System (SMOPS), SM from the Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR-2) and SM from the Advanced
   Scatterometer (ASCAT) over Australia and south-west Pacific SIDS.
   Products were first evaluated in Australia, given the presence of
   several in-situ SM monitoring stations and a state-of-the-art
   hydrological model-the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape
   modelling system (AWRA-L). We further investigated the accuracy of SM
   satellite datasets in Australia and the south-west Pacific through
   Triple Collocation analysis with two other SM reference datasets-ERA5
   reanalysis SM data and model data from the Global Land Data Assimilation
   System (GLDAS) dataset. All datasets have differing observation periods
   ranging from 1911-now, with a common period of observations between
   2015-2021. Results demonstrated that ASCAT and SMOS were consistently
   superior in their performance. Analysis in the six south-west Pacific
   SIDS indicated reduced performance for all products, with ASCAT and SMOS
   still performing better than others for most SIDS with median R values
   ranging between 0.3-0.9. We conducted a case study of the 2015 El Nino
   and Positive Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought in Papua New Guinea. It
   was shown that ASCAT is a valuable dataset indicative of
   agrometeorological drought for the nation, highlighting the value of
   using satellite SM products to provide early warning of drought in
   data-sparse regions in the south-west Pacific.},

Title = {A rapid fractionation method for assessing key soil phosphorus
   parameters in agroecosystems},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {385},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {A wide variety of soil phosphorus (P) fractionation schemes have been
   developed and used extensively for over 60 years, however, most are
   laborious and provide limited information on key parameters such as P
   mobility and adsorption. We propose an alternative multi-stage
   extraction technique that it is possible to complete in one day. This
   involves separate analysis of three subsamples, including assessment of
   inorganic P (Pi) adsorption capacity, P fractions (sequential extraction
   with 1 M CaCl2, Mehlich-3, 0.5 M NaOH, 1 M HCl, and total P (H2SO4-H2O2
   digestion)). This provides data on potentially mobile Pi,
   plant-available Pi, moderately plant-available Pi, organic P, occluded
   P, the degree of P saturation, together with a ``legacy P index{''}.
   Assessment of these parameters involved comparing two contrasting soils
   that had received similar P inputs as pig manure over two years. Results
   showed that P inputs significantly increased all soil P fractions, with
   concomitant significant increases in P saturation and legacy P. The
   findings of this study demonstrated the potential value in using the
   proposed methodology to provide a comprehensive suite of
   physico-chemical soil P data. This information may facilitate
   investigation and quantification of the impacts of land management and
   inputs on the dynamics and bioavailability of soil P in agroecosystems,
   although further assessment and validation is required.},

Abstract = {Downscaling microwave remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) is an effective
   way to obtain spatial continuous SM with fine resolution for
   hydrological and agricultural applications on a regional scale.
   Downscaling factors and functions are two basic components of SM
   downscaling where the former is particularly important in the era of big
   data. Based on machine learning method, this study evaluated Land
   Surface Temperature (LST), Land surface Evaporative Efficiency (LEE),
   and geographical factors from Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products for downscaling SMAP (Soil Moisture
   Active and Passive) SM products. This study spans from 2015 to the end
   of 2018 and locates in the central United States. Original SMAP SM and
   in-situ SM at sparse networks and core validation sites were used as
   reference. Experiment results indicated that (1) LEE presented
   comparative performance with LST as downscaling factors; (2) adding
   geographical factors can significantly improve the performance of SM
   downscaling; (3) integrating LST, LEE, and geographical factors got the
   best performance; (4) using Z-score normalization or hyperbolic-tangent
   normalization methods did not change the above conclusions, neither did
   using support vector regression nor feed forward neural network methods.
   This study demonstrates the possibility of LEE as an alternative of LST
   for downscaling SM when there is no available LST due to cloud
   contamination. It also provides experimental evidence for adding
   geographical factors in the downscaling process.},

   Forest},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Soil water content is an important hydrological parameter, which is
   difficult to measure at a field scale due to its spatial and temporal
   heterogeneity. The Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) is a novel and
   innovative approach to estimate area-averaged soil water content at an
   intermediate scale, which has been implemented across the globe. The
   CRNS is moderated by all hydrogen sources within its measurement
   footprint. In order to isolate the soil water content signal from the
   neutron intensity, the other sources of hydrogen need to be accounted
   for. The CRNS's applications are not only limited to soil water content
   estimation, as it can potentially be used to monitor biomass. The
   Two-Streams clear-felling provided the unique opportunity to monitor the
   cosmic ray neutron intensities before, during, and after the
   clear-felling. The cadmium-difference method was used to obtain the pure
   thermal and epithermal neutron intensities from the bare and moderated
   detectors. The study concluded that the presence of biomass within the
   site reduced the epithermal neutron intensity by 12.43\% and
   theN(0)value by 13.8\%. The use of the neutron ratio to monitor biomass
   was evaluated and changes in the neutron ratio coincided with biomass
   changes and resulted in a high correlation (R(2)of 0.868) with the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and (R(2)of 0.817) leaf
   area index (LAI). The use of the CRNS to simultaneously monitor soil
   water content and biomass will be beneficial in providing more reliable
   soil water content estimates, provide biomass estimates at a field
   scale, and aid in understanding the dynamics between soil water content
   and vegetation.},

Abstract = {Mapping the soil moisture is a key activity in water management and
   sustainable agriculture, especially in regions characterised by fragile
   agri-food systems and water scarcity. Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensors (CRNS)
   is a contactless nuclear technology used for estimating soil moisture
   (SM) content on a 20-30 m scale at the landscape level. Very
   interestingly, this corresponds to the so-called intermediate scale gap
   between the local probes, operating on the meter scale, and the
   satellite-based technologies, working on the kilometre scale and above.
   In state-of-art CRNS, the cosmic neutrons degraded by the soil are
   simply counted by a slightly moderated thermal neutron counter. After a
   calibration procedure, the SM is inferred by combining this count rate
   with environmental parameters: the atmospheric pressure, temperature and
   the air humidity. As the SM affects not only the environmental neutron
   fluence rate but also its energy distribution, this study was organised
   in such a way to understand if a CRNS with spectrometric capabilities
   could provide improved information on the SM distribution. To this aim,
   an environmental neutron spectrometer was designed by extending the

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an essential component for the planetary balance
   between land surface water and energy. Obtaining long-term global soil
   moisture data is important for understanding the water cycle changes in
   the warming climate. To date several satellite soil moisture products
   are being developed with varying retrieval algorithms, however with
   considerable missing values. To resolve the data gaps, here we have
   constructed two global satellite soil moisture products, i.e., the CCI
   (Climate Change Initiative soil moisture, 1989-2021; CCIori hereafter)
   and the CM (Correlation Merging soil moisture, 2006-2019; CMori
   hereafter) products separately using a Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN) with autoencoding approach, which considers soil moisture
   variability in both time and space. The reconstructed datasets, namely
   CCIrec and CMrec, are cross-evaluated with artificial missing values,
   and further againt in-situ observations from 12 networks including 485
   stations globally, with multiple error metrics of correlation
   coefficients (R), bias, root mean square errors (RMSE) and unbiased root
   mean square error (ubRMSE) respectively. The cross-validation results
   show that the reconstructed missing values have high R (0.987 and 0.974,
   respectively) and low RMSE (0.015 and 0.032 m(3)/m(3), respectively)
   with the original ones. The in-situ validation shows that the global
   mean R between CCIrec (CCIori) and in-situ observations is 0.590
   (0.581), RMSE is 0.093 (0.093) m(3)/m(3), ubRMSE is 0.059 (0.058)
   m(3)/m(3), bias is 0.032 (0.037) m(3)/m(3) respectively; CMrec (CMori)
   shows quite similar results. The added value of this study is to provide
   long-term gap-free satellite soil moisture products globally, which
   helps studies in the fields of hydrology, meteorology, ecology and
   climate sciences.},

Abstract = {A dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensor is a robust tool that can measure
   soil thermal properties and associated soil physical properties and
   processes. A new DPHP based sensor was developed to simultaneously
   measure soil thermal properties, soil water content and soil water
   matric potential. A series of experiments were performed to evaluate the
   sensor performance. The new sensor was able to measure each soil
   property with acceptable accuracy. The accuracy of the matric potential
   determinations was approximately 10\% in log scale. The effective range
   for w measurements was -1000 to -2.5 m of water, and the accuracy of the
   w determinations was best between -350 and -2.5 m of water, which
   included values of field capacity and wilting point for most soils and
   crops. The sensor design included a single heater wire to provide
   simultaneous heat inputs to two different materials, i.e., the soil and
   the sensor porous medium. The single heater wire did not influence
   sensor accuracy as long as the soil and the sensor porous medium thermal
   conductivity values were not significantly different. The new DPHP based
   sensor effectively measured various soil properties, including soil
   water matric potential, soil water content, and soil thermal property

Title = {Improving CYGNSS-Based Soil Moisture Coverage Through Autocorrelation
   and Machine Learning-Aided Method},

Abstract = {Global Navigation System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a microwave remote
   sensing technology that enables Earth observation by receiving GNSS
   signals reflected from the Earth's surface. The Cyclone Global
   Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation is a satellite system
   that uses GNSS-R technology with high temporal resolution and has been a
   popular data source in soil moisture retrieval in recent years. However,
   the constant movement of GNSS transmitters and GNSS-R satellites results
   in potentially chaotic and random observations of the Earth's surface,
   with many unevenly distributed gaps in the observed data. In this paper,
   a gap-filling method based on spatial autocorrelation is proposed to
   interpolate the gaps within these observation datasets, with SM being
   estimated post-interpolation. The sample set for the model comprises
   points surrounding the interpolation target, with modeling conducted
   considering factors of spatial weighting to estimate values at the
   interpolation target. Different autocorrelation-based gap-filling
   methods using CYGNSS data can achieve good estimation accuracy, and the
   data coverage after interpolation is on average 1.8 times greater than
   before interpolation. The gap-filling method using XGBoost achieves the
   best performance and offers the highest accuracy in SM estimation, with
   an average correlation coefficient of 0.8445, and an average RMSE of
   0.0457 m(3)/m(3). The gap-filling approach can significantly enhance
   data coverage and facilitate the filling of daily gaps in CYGNSS data
   with all maintaining high SM estimation accuracy. The estimation of
   daily missing values using CYGNSS data can fully exploit the embedded
   surface features in the data's fine resolution and can provide
   high-resolution SM retrieval.},

   Moisture in Agricultural Fields},

Year = {2021},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Soil is an important element in the agricultural domain because it
   serves as the media that bridges the water consumption and supply
   processes. In this study, a neural network ensemble (NNE) method was
   employed to predict the soil moisture to eliminate the effects of random
   initial parameters of neural network (NN) on model accuracy. The
   constructed NNE model predicts daily root zone soil moisture
   continuously for the whole crop growing season and the water consumption
   and supply processes were separately modeled. The soil profile was
   divided into multiple layers and modeled separately. Weather data
   (including air temperature, humidity, wind speed, net radiation, and
   precipitation), rooting depth, and the hesternal soil moisture of each
   layer were used as the input. A calibrated root zone water quality model
   for maize (Zea mays L.) was used to generate training and evaluation
   data. The result showed that with 100 randomly initialized NN models,
   the NNE model achieved an average R-2 of 0.96 and nRMSE of 5.93\%,
   suggesting that the NNE model learned the soil moisture dynamics well
   and sufficiently improved the robustness of soil moisture prediction
   with high accuracy.},

Title = {A Machine Learning-Based Geostatistical Downscaling Method for
   Coarse-Resolution Soil Moisture Products},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},
Pages = {1025-1037},
Abstract = {The surface soil moisture (SSM) products derived from microwave remote
   sensing have a coarse spatial resolution; therefore, downscaling is
   required to obtain accurate SSM at high spatial resolution. An effective
   way to handle the stratified heterogeneity is to model for various
   stratifications; however, the number of samples is often limited under
   each stratification, influencing the downscaling accuracy. In this
   study, a machine learning-based geostatistical model, which combines
   various kinds of ancillary information at fine spatial scale, is
   developed for spatial downscaling. The proposed support vector
   area-to-area regression kriging (SVATARK) model incorporates support
   vector regression and area-to-area kriging by considering the nonlinear
   relationships among variables for various stratifications. SVATARK also
   considers the change of support problem in the downscaling interpolation
   process as well as for solving the small sample size in trend
   prediction. The SVATARK method is evaluated in the Naqu region on the
   Tibetan Plateau, China, to downscale the European Space Agency's (ESA)
   25-km-resolution SSM product. The 1-km-resolution SSM predictions have
   been produced every eight days over a six-year period (2010-2015).
   Compared with five other downscaling methods, the downscaled predictions
   from the SVATARK method performs the best with in situ observations,
   resulting in a 24.4\% reduction in root-mean-square error with 0.08
   m(3)center dot m(-3) and a 8.2\% increase in correlation coefficient
   with 0.72, on average. Additionally, anomalously low SSM values, an
   indicator of drought, had a record low anomaly in mid-July for 2015, as
   noted by previous studies, indicating that SVATARK could be utilized for
   drought monitoring.},

Title = {Effect of X-Ray Tube Configuration on Measurement of Key Soil Fertility
   Attributes with XRF},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The successful use of energy-dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF)
   sensors for soil analysis requires the selection of an optimal procedure
   of data acquisition and a simple modelling approach. This work aimed at
   assessing the performance of a portable XRF (XRF) sensor set up with two
   different X-ray tube configurations (combinations of voltage and
   current) to predict nine key soil fertility attributes: (clay, organic
   matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V),
   and extractable nutrients (P, K, Ca, and Mg). An XRF, operated at a
   voltage of 15 kV (and current of 23 mu A) and 35 kV (and current of 7 mu
   A), was used for analyzing 102 soil samples collected from two
   agricultural fields in Brazil. Two different XRF data analysis scenarios
   were used to build the predictive models: (i) 10 emission lines of 15
   keV spectra (EL-15), and (ii) 12 emission lines of 35 keV spectra
   (EL-35). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used for model
   calibration, and the models' prediction performance was evaluated using
   different figures of merit. The results show that although X-ray tube
   configuration affected the intensity of the emission lines of the
   different elements detected, it did not influence the prediction
   accuracy of the studied key fertility attributes, suggesting that both
   X-ray tube configurations tested can be used for future analyses.
   Satisfactory predictions with residual prediction deviation (RPD) >=
   1.54 and coefficient of determination (R-2) >= 0.61 were obtained for
   eight out of the ten studied soil fertility attributes (clay, OM, CEC,
   V, and extractable K, Ca, and Mg). In addition, simple MLR models with a
   limited number of emission lines was effective for practical soil
   analysis of the key soil fertility attributes (except pH and extractable
   P) using XRF. The simple and transparent methodology suggested also
   enables future researches that seek to optimize the XRF scanning time in
   order to speed up the XRF analysis in soil samples.},

Title = {Can spectral analyses improve measurement of key soil fertility
   parameters with X-ray fluorescence spectrometry?},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {350},
Pages = {29-39},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {While laboratory methods of elemental analysis of soil nutrients are
   used frequently to support soil studies, the implementation of more
   portable and cost-efficient methods lingers behind. The portable
   (handheld) X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) is one such tool
   enabling onsite elemental analysis in a straightforward manner. However,
   in soil studies the use of XRF often remains cumbersome, following the
   poor performance of the method for low-Z elemental analysis and the
   complex nature of the soil matrix, introducing background noise. Here,
   we therefore evaluate how the potential use of a portable XRF for
   predicting potassium (K), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and calcium
   (Ca) can be improved through the analysis of XRF spectral data with the
   Random Forest (RF) machine learning method. A total of 105 soil samples
   from a wide range of soils collected from 10 different countries (D.R.
   Congo, Belgium, Ivory Coast, Italy, The Netherlands, Saudi-Arabia, South
   Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe) were scanned using an Oxford
   XMET8000 XRF spectrometer (Oxford Instruments, UK). Spectral data of the
   calibration set (n = 74) were pulled in one matrix alongside measured
   elemental concentrations and subjected to RF analysis. Resulting models
   were validated using an independent validation set (n = 31). The best RF
   prediction result was obtained for K followed successively by Ca, Mg and
   P with coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.69,
   and 0.47, and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2283.8,
   6818.7, 1511.8, and 538.08 mg kg(-1), respectively. The RF modelling
   procedure provided improved prediction performance compared to the
   calibration models provided by the manufacturer (R-2 = 0.65, 0.75, 0.65,
   and 0.22, for K, Ca, Mg and P, respectively). Our results suggest that
   portable XRF instruments coupled with spectral data analysis by RF
   allows for rapid and low-cost analysis of soil K and Ca with remarkable
   accuracy. Still, the lower measurement accuracy for P and Mg suggests
   further work is needed to test whether the prediction can be improved by
   better calibration models, and how such approaches can help overcoming
   instrumental limitations.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an important variable in mediating the
   land-atmosphere interactions. Earth System Models (ESMs) are the key
   tools for predicting the response of SM to future climate change. Many
   ESMs provide outputs for SM; however, the estimated SM accuracy from
   different ESMs varies geographically as each ESM has its advantages and
   limitations. This study aimed to develop a merged SM product with
   improved accuracy and spatial resolution in China for 2015-2100 through
   data fusion of 25 ESMs with a deep-learning (DL) method. A DL model that
   can simultaneously perform data fusion and spatial downscaling was used
   to analyze SM's future trend in China. Through the model, monthly SM
   data in four future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5)
   from 2015 to 2100, with a high resolution at 0.25 degrees, was obtained.
   The evaluation metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean
   square difference (RMSD), unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD),
   and coefficient of correlation (r). The evaluation results showed that
   our merged SM product is significantly better than each of the ESMs and
   the ensemble mean of all ESMs in terms of accuracy and spatial
   distribution. In the temporal dimension, the merged product is
   equivalent to the original data after deviation correction and
   equivalent to reconstructing the fluctuation of the whole series in a
   high error area. By further analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM
   with the merged product in China, we found that northeast China will
   become wetter whereas South China will become drier. Northwest China and
   the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau would change from wetting to drying under a
   medium emission scenario. From the temporal scale of the results, the
   rate of SM variations is accelerated with time in the future under
   different scenarios. This study demonstrates the feasibility and
   effectiveness of the proposed procedure for simultaneous data fusion and
   spatial downscaling to generate improved SM data. The merged data have
   great practical and scientific implications.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture content is an important parameter in hydrological,
   meteorological, and agricultural applications. Balenzano et al. proposed
   the alpha approximation method in 2011 for solving some complex issues
   during the retrieval of soil moisture over agricultural crops with
   synthetic aperture radar data. However, determining the constraints and
   solving the underdetermined system of equations in this method add new
   challenges. Considering the questions of constraints and underdetermined
   system of equations, the alpha approximation method is used to augment
   the measured data, and can avoid solving the underdetermined system of
   equations with constraints directly. Then, these data are applied in a
   support vector regression machine for soil moisture estimation. It is
   found that when an optimal model is determined, the method proposed in
   this article is superior to the direct use of the alpha approximation
   method, and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) decreased from 0.0775 to
   0.0339 and R-2 increased from 0.0467 to 0.6491. In addition, the method
   obtained a good result from a data set collected that included a
   different growing period of crops by changing the standardized method
   from StandardScaler to Scale, where the RMSE is 0.0501 and R-2 is
   0.3204. This indicates the good generalization capability of this
   method. In conclusion, the proposed method solves the two questions
   effectively and provides a potential way for long-time or large-scale
   soil moisture monitoring with much less in situ measurements.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture prediction is of great importance in crop yield
   forecasting and drought monitoring. In this study, the multi-layer root
   zone soil moisture (0-5, 0-10, 10-40 and 40-100 cm) prediction is
   conducted over an agriculture dominant basin, namely the Xiang River
   Basin, in southern China. The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with
   dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with
   SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil
   moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely
   SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in
   multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF,
   respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance
   of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the
   applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture
   prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil
   moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is
   satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for
   the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM
   can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than
   47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all
   layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its
   performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the
   performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and
   the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the
   reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%.
   However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no
   further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF. (c) The SVM-EnKF can
   eliminate the influence of remote sensing soil moisture extreme values
   in soil moisture prediction, therefore, improve its accuracy.},

Title = {Estimation and evaluation of high spatial resolution surface soil
   moisture using multi-sensor multi-resolution approach},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {378},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Various soil moisture products (AMSR-E at 25 km, SMAP at 9 km, CCI at 25
   km) available from different space agencies, derived using the active
   microwave remote sensing, may not be suitable for studies at a local
   level due to their coarse spatial resolution. Hence, an attempt has been
   made in this study to estimate the surface soil moisture at high spatial
   resolution using different high-resolution multispectral imageries from
   Landsat 8 OLI (Optical Land Imager) and Sentinel 2A MSI (Multi Spectral
   Instrument), of similar date. The thermal (10.9 mu m) and short wave
   infra-red (SWIR) (2.2 mu m) bands of the Landsat image and the SWIR band
   (2.19 mu m) of Sentinel image were used to estimate the soil moisture at
   a spatial resolution of 30 m and 20 m respectively, whereas the red and
   near infrared (NIR) bands of both the images were used to estimate the
   dryness. As the thermal band at high spatial resolution (at 20 m or
   below) is not available, this study attempted to bridge the gap and
   integrate mull-sensor and multi-resolution feature space utilizing
   various scalable procedures so as to estimate soil moisture and dryness.
   Limitation due to unavailability of the thermal bands in Sentinel
   multispectral image was overcome through a bridging procedure using
   Landsat thermal bands derived LST and Sentinel derived NDVI to estimate
   Sentinel LST at 20 m. The distribution pattern of high-resolution
   estimated soil moisture in each coarse spatial resolution grid (1 km)
   was taken into consideration to downscale the available CCI and SMAP
   soil moisture data. The estimated soil moisture and dryness were
   upscaled to 1 km and then validated using the downscaled soil moisture
   products (SMAP and CCI), and a significant correlation having R-2
   greater than 0.8, 0.5 and 0.4 was observed for the thermal band derived
   soil moisture, short wave band derived soil moisture, and the red and
   NIR band derived dryness, respectively. To understand the temporal
   variability of the soil moisture, data from three different seasons
   representing extreme soil moisture conditions (winter, summer and
   monsoon) were analyzed and found that the independently estimated soil
   moisture had errors in temporal continuity and spatial spread. Hence,
   the estimated soil moisture was standardized using annual information
   which resulted in more accurate products, and the SWIR Transformed
   Reflectance (STR) derived soil moisture was more accurate than LST
   derived product.},

Abstract = {dos Santos Teixeira et al. evaluated the effectiveness of three
   different sensors, portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry,
   visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR), and NixProTM color sensor, in
   predicting six soil properties including sum of bases (SB), effective
   cation exchange capacity (eCEC), potential cation exchange capacity
   (CEC), base saturation (BS), soil organic matter (SOM) content, and soil
   pH, and compared their performance when used alone or in combination.
   Preprocessing methods and other variables were also analyzed. In this
   comment paper, some misuses of Kappa statistic in the original paper by
   dos Santos Teixeira et al. are discussed. The authors calculated Cohen's
   kappa coefficient to make categorical predictions for soil fertility
   classes. However, using Cohen's Kappa to estimate the intra-rater
   reliabilities (IRRs) is not appropriate on the condition of ordinal
   categorical variables in four or five categories in the original paper.
   We briefly introduce the Kappa statistic for evaluation of IRR between
   two raters and propose to use weighted Kappa to compute IRRs under such
   conditions. To conclude, we recognize that this does not significantly
   alter the conclusions of this paper, but it is necessary to ensure that
   the appropriate statistical tools are used.},

Abstract = {The conceptual design of a soil-moisture measurement instrument using a
   rectangular soil sample and an almost collimated Am-241-Be-9 source was
   proposed. Unlike previous studies and in a different simulation
   approach, the soil moisture was determined using the angular
   distribution of thermal neutrons using MCNPX2.6 Monte Carlo code, where
   a cylindrical BF3 proportional counter located at different polar angles
   was responsible for thermal neutron detection. Both Monte Carlo library
   least-squares method (MCLLS) and artificial neural networks (ANN) were
   used to calculate the soil moisture based on BF3 count rates with small
   relative error, about 2\% and 10\% maximum relative errors,
   respectively.},

Title = {Novel Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor Accurately Captures Field-Scale Soil
   Moisture Trends under Heterogeneous Soil Textures},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical variable influencing plant water uptake,
   rainfall-runoff partitioning, and near-surface atmospheric conditions.
   Soil moisture measurements are typically made using either in-situ
   sensors or by collecting samples, both methods which have a small
   spatial footprint or, in recent years, by remote sensing satellites with
   large spatial footprints. The cosmic ray neutron sensor (CRNS) is a
   proximal technology which provides estimates of field-averaged soil
   moisture within a radius of up to 240 m from the sensor, offering a much
   larger sensing footprint than point measurements and providing
   field-scale information that satellite soil moisture observations cannot
   capture. Here we compare volumetric soil moisture estimates derived from
   a novel, less expensive lithium (Li) foil-based CRNS to those from a
   more expensive commercially available He-3-based CRNS, to measurements
   from in-situ sensors, and to four intensive surveys of soil moisture in
   a field with highly variable soil texture. Our results indicate that the
   accuracy of the Li foil CRNS is comparable to that of the commercially
   available sensors (MAD = 0.020 m(3) m(-3)), as are the detection radius
   and depth. Additionally, both sensors capture the influence of soil
   textural variability on field-average soil moisture. Because novel Li
   foil-based CRNSs are comparable in accuracy to and much less expensive
   than current commercially available CRNSs, there is strong potential for
   future adoption by land and water managers and increased adoption by
   researchers interested in obtaining field-scale estimates of soil
   moisture to improve water conservation and sustainability.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the global water crisis poses a great challenge to humanity
   and a risk to be managed by future generations. In order to use this
   resource consciously, it is known in the area of agricultural irrigation
   the need to evaluate the amount of water to be used. Among the soil
   moisture content determination methods, sensors, coupled to a
   programmable logic controller, emerge as an alternative to conventional
   laboratory methods, making the procedure faster and less labor
   intensive. In this sense, the present work aimed to evaluate the
   reliability and precision of a low-cost sensor to determine soil
   moisture content. It was concluded that the evaluated sensors did not
   present a known precision to estimate the level of soil moisture
   content. A FC-28 sensor coupled with a Arduino platform was used with
   three different soils (texture: low, medium and heavy), moisture ranging
   from 15 to 50\%. The results indicated that soil texture influenced the
   readings, even at the same humidity. In addition, the evaluated sensors
   did not present replicability nor accuracy for less them 10\% moisture
   differences. Therefore, there is need to calibrate each sensor
   individually.},

   Moisture Sensor Applied in Subgrade Engineering},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MATERIALS SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {AUG 12},
Abstract = {The soil is an important natural resource, and its moisture status plays
   a key role in the strength and stability of the soil structure. In civil
   industries including the agriculture engineering and the forestry
   engineering, moisture sensors are widely used to test and monitor the
   engineering properties and long-term service performance of soil. The
   influence of multiple factors on the quality and the accuracy of the
   soil moisture sensor should be taken into account. Both laboratory and
   field tests were performed by the time-domain reflectometry (TDR)
   method. The soil dielectric constant and magnetic permeability under
   different moisture contents, different temperatures, and different dry
   densities were comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the
   sensitive factors in the service performance of the TDR sensor have been
   revealed by the real state of tested soil samples. Based on the testing
   principle of TDR, a calibration calculation model has been developed to
   evaluate accurately the moisture content of the subgrade slope. The
   results show that both the moisture content and the dry density had a
   significant influence on the dielectric constant and the magnetic
   permeability of soil. The developed calculation model has a good fitting
   effect and stability. Through the model, the influence of moisture
   content and temperature on the soil dielectric constant has been
   analyzed, and the fitting goodness is above 90\%. After half a year of
   settlement, the soil was gradually drained and consolidated, and the
   moisture content of the subgrade section gradually decreased. It
   verified that the monitoring method determined by the laboratory
   calibration test was effective and accurate.},

Title = {Towards rapid analysis with XRF sensor for assessing soil fertility
   attributes: Effects of dwell time reduction},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The analysis time used for the diagnosis of soil fertility attributes
   using portable X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) sensors (between 30
   and 90 s) is too long for in situ applications. The present study aimed
   at evaluating the trade-off between dwell time and XRF performance for
   assessing soil fertility attributes. A total of 102 soil samples
   acquired in two Brazilian agricultural fields were used, whose spectra
   were obtained using dwell times of 90, 60, 30, 15, 10, 7, 4, and 2 s to
   build and validate calibration models for clay, cation exchange
   capacity, and extractable K and Ca. Results revealed that it is possible
   to make drastic reductions in the XRF dwell time (from 90 to 2 s), while
   keeping excellent prediction performance {[}ratio of performance to
   interquartile distance (RPIQ) between 3.52 and 8.32] for all the studied
   attributes. A dwell time of only 2 s performed satisfactorily and is an
   analysis time suitable for rapid in situ applications. In addition, it
   was shown that data from spectral databases previously collected that
   used long dwell times (e.g., 30, 60, 90 s) can be extrapolated to fast
   applications with shorter dwell times (e.g., 2 and 4 s), once
   standardization by the detector's live time has been performed. Anyhow,
   calibrations using a dwell time similar to the one of the validation set
   tended to show superior results and are therefore recommended. This
   study addresses the need and provides guidelines for optimizing XRF
   sensor analysis time for in situ applications in the context of
   precision agriculture.},

Abstract = {A high-resolution soil moisture prediction method has recently gained
   its importance in various fields such as forestry, agricultural and land
   management. However, accurate, robust and non-cost prohibitive spatially
   monitoring of soil moisture is challenging. In this research, a new
   approach involving the use of advance machine learning (ML) models, and
   multi-sensor data fusion including Sentinel-1(S1) C-band dual
   polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Sentinel-2 (S2)
   multispectral data, and ALOS Global Digital Surface Model (ALOS DSM) to
   predict precisely soil mois-ture at 10 m spatial resolution across
   research areas in Australia. The total of 52 predictor variables
   generated from S1, S2 and ALOS DSM data fusion, including vegetation
   indices, soil indices, water index, SAR transformation indices, ALOS DSM
   derived indices like digital model elevation (DEM), slope, and
   topographic wetness index (TWI). The field soil data from Western
   Australia was employed. The performance capability of extreme gradient
   boosting regres-sion (XGBR) together with the genetic algorithm (GA)
   optimizer for features selection and optimization for soil mois-ture
   prediction in bare lands was examined and compared with various
   scenarios and ML models. The proposed model (the XGBR-GA model) with 21
   optimal features obtained from GA was yielded the highest performance
   (R-2 = 0.891; RMSE = 0.875\%) compared to random forest regression
   (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost gradient boosting
   regression (CBR). Conclusively, the new approach using the XGBR-GA with
   features from combination of reliable free-of-charge remotely sensed
   data from Sentinel and ALOS imagery can effectively estimate the spatial
   variability of soil moisture. The described framework can further
   support precision agriculture and drought resilience programs via water
   use efficiency and smart irrigation management for crop production.},

Abstract = {Inexpensive and no-maintenance biodegradable soil moisture sensors could
   improve existing knowledge on spatial and temporal variability of
   available soil water at field-scale. Such sensors can unlock the full
   potential of variable-rate irrigation (VRI) systems to optimize water
   applications in irrigated cropping systems. The objectives of this study
   were to assess (i) the degradation of soil moisture sensor component
   materials and (ii) the effects of material degradation on maize (Zea
   Mays L.) growth and development. This study was conducted in a
   greenhouse at Colorado State University, Colorado, USA, by planting
   maize seeds in pots filled with three growing media (field soil, silica
   sand, and Promix commercial potting media). The degradation rate of five
   candidate sensor materials (three blends of beeswax and soy wax, balsa
   wood, and PHBV (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate))) was
   assessed by harvesting sensor materials at four maize growth stages (30,
   60, 90, and 120 days after transplanting). All materials under
   consideration showed stability in terms of mass and dimension except
   PHBV. PHBV was degraded entirely within 30 days in soil and Promix, and
   within 60 days in sand. Balsa wood did now show any significant
   reduction in mass and dimensions in all growth media. Similarly, there
   was no significant mass loss across wax blends (p = 0.05) at any growth
   stage, with a few exceptions. Among the wax blends, 3:1 (beeswax:soy
   wax) was the most stable blend in terms of mass and dimension with no
   surface cracks, making it a suitable encapsulant for soil sensor. All
   materials under consideration did not have any significant effect on
   maize growth (dry biomass, green biomass, and height) as compared to
   control plants. These results indicated that 3:1 beeswax:soy wax blend,
   PHBV, and balsa wood could be suitable candidates for various components
   of biodegradable soil moisture sensors.},

Abstract = {Soil harbours innumerable microorganisms, nutrients, and other crucial
   elements, it anchors vegetation and supplies it with the primary factors
   that make agriculture possible. Soil health is determined by quantifying
   nutrients and physical parameters that are required to be in optimum

   work presents an integrated, low-cost, microfluidic-based system for the
   detection of three such parameters namely- nitrite, pH and electrical
   conductivity (EC). A filtration protocol using different grades of
   Whatman filter paper was established to detect the said parameters using
   a suspension of soil. A multiplexed polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device
   was designed and fabricated to test for EC and nitrite. The device
   employed a conductivity cell with copper electrodes, connected in series
   with a resistor, powered using an oscillating power source. Griess
   reaction-based photometric detection using an LED and photodiode was
   used to quantify nitrite. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was
   designed and fabricated to amplify the photodiode output. pH detection
   was achieved using a commercially available pH probe and an Arduino pH
   breakout board. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to
   achieve flow control. Atmega 328P (onboard Arduino Uno) was used to
   integrate the subsystems. A smartphone application was built to control
   the system and store geotagged data. Bluetooth protocol was used to
   communicate between the smartphone application and Arduino. Standards
   and real soil samples were tested using the developed microfluidic

Title = {Accuracy and precision of the cosmic-ray neutron sensor for soil
   moisture estimation at humid environments},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {The accuracy and precision of the cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS)
   neutron count and soil moisture estimate are affected differently by
   distinct neutron moderating factors. Moreover, whereas the accuracy can
   be improved by correcting for different hydrogen pools, the precision
   can only be improved by increasing the surface area of the CRNS sensors
   or by increasing the integration time. To date, the effects of different
   neutron moderating factors on CRNS accuracy and precision are not
   completely understood. We used data from three agricultural and low
   biomass sites located within a few kilometres distance from each other
   in South England. We developed an extended version of the COsmic-ray
   Soil Moisture Interaction Code (COSMIC), which included the effects of
   relevant neutron moderating factors on the neutron counts. With
   sensitivity analysis, we found atmospheric pressure and soil moisture
   content to be most influential on neutron count accuracy and precision.
   These two factors were, respectively, seven and four times more
   important than soil bulk density, lattice water and soil organic matter.
   Above ground biomass was substantially less influential compared to
   these variables. However, because the three sites had similar soil
   organic matter and meteorology, calibration results showed that
   differences between sites could be mostly explained by differences in
   above ground biomass and to a lesser extent intercepted water. The
   neutron count differences due to above ground biomass corresponded with
   substantial soil moisture estimate differences up to 0.07cm3cm-3; a
   significant effect on soil moisture accuracy. The precision of the soil
   moisture estimate was 10 times more sensitive to soil moisture than
   other factors and was therefore mostly a function of soil moisture
   content itself. The neutron count integration times required to obtain a
   soil moisture precision were typically less than a day. Our results are
   indicative for other humid, temperate, agricultural sites.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-Ray Neutron Probes (CRNP) have found application in soil moisture
   (SM) estimation due to their conveniently large (>100 m) footprints.
   Here, we explore the possibility of using high-density polyethylene
   (HDPE) moderator to limit the field of view, and hence, the footprint of
   a SM sensor formed of 12 CRNP mounted on to a mobile robotic platform
   (Thorvald) for better in-field localization of moisture variation. Ultra
   Rapid Adaptable Neutron-Only Simulation neutron scattering simulations
   are used to show that 5 cm of additional HDPE moderator (used to shield
   the upper surface and sides of the detector) is sufficient to (a) reduce
   the footprint of the detector considerably, (b) approximately double the
   percentage of neutrons detected from within 5 m of the detector, and (c)
   does not affect the shape of the curve used to convert neutron counts
   into SM. Simulation and rover measurements for a transect crossing
   between grass and concrete additionally suggest that (d) SM changes can
   be sensed over a length scales of tens of meters or less (roughly an
   order of magnitude smaller than commonly used footprint distances), and
   (e) the additional moderator does not reduce the detected neutron count
   rate (and hence increase noise) as much as might be expected given the
   extent of the additional moderator. The detector with additional HDPE
   moderator was also used to conduct measurements on a stubble field over
   three weeks to test the rover system in measuring spatial and temporal
   SM variation.},

Title = {Topographic Drivers of Soil Moisture Across a Large Sensor Network in
   the Southern Appalachian Mountains (USA)},

Abstract = {Understanding the distribution of soil moisture is notoriously difficult
   in topographically complex regions that are subject to both large-scale
   climate gradients and fine-scale effects of terrain, vegetation, and
   soil structure. Remote sensing approaches capture large-scale moisture
   patterns but are limited in spatial and temporal resolution, while
   commercial field sensors remain too expensive to deploy intensively over
   large spatial extents. Here, we demonstrate the use of low-cost (<20
   USD) custom sensors to create a large monitoring network of surficial
   (0-15 cm depth) volumetric soil moisture content (VMC) across Great
   Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) (NC, TN, USA). In laboratory
   tests, temperature-calibrated VMC values approached the accuracy of
   commercial probes. We deployed over 80 sensors across multiple
   watersheds, topographic positions, and a 1,800-m elevation gradient, and
   created hierarchical models to understand associations of VMC with
   spatial (30-m resolution) and temporal (daily) variables related to
   water supply and demand. Elevation had the strongest association with
   VMC, with a fivefold increase across the gradient reflecting 1.5-fold
   changes in both (increased) precipitation and (decreased)
   evapotranspiration; slope angle was a strong mediating factor. Common
   proxies for moisture including topographic convergence index were not
   associated with VMC, likely due to limited contributions of surface
   drainage to local water balance. Our model predicted daily VMC of a set
   of validation sensors with a root mean square error of 4.8\%, which may
   be improved by site-specific field calibration. Our study indicates that
   spatially extensive, field-based soil moisture networks are practical,
   accurate, and an important component of regional environmental
   monitoring.},

Title = {Temporal Stability of Grassland Soil Moisture Utilising Sentinel-2
   Satellites and Sparse Ground-Based Sensor Networks},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is important for understanding climate, water resources,
   water storage, and land use management. This study used Sentinel-2 (S-2)
   satellite optical data to retrieve surface soil moisture at a 10 m scale
   on grassland sites with low hydraulic conductivity soil in a climate
   dominated by heavy rainfall. Soil moisture was estimated after modifying
   the Optical Trapezoidal Model to account for mixed land cover in such
   conditions. The method uses data from a short-wave infra-red band, which
   is sensitive to soil moisture, and four vegetation indices from optical
   bands, which are sensitive to overlying vegetation. Scatter plots of
   these data from multiple, infrequent satellite passes are used to define
   the range of surface moisture conditions. The saturated and dry edges
   are clearly non-linear, regardless of the choice of vegetation index.
   Land cover masks are used to generate scatter plots from data only over
   grassland sites. The Enhanced Vegetation Index demonstrated advantages
   over other vegetation indices for surface moisture estimation over the
   entire range of grassland conditions. In poorly drained soils, the time
   lag between satellite surface moisture retrievals and in situ sensor
   soil moisture at depth must be part of the validation process. This was
   achieved by combining an approximate solution to the Richards' Equation,
   along with measurements of saturated and residual moisture from soil
   samples, to optimise the correlations between measurements from
   satellites and sensors at a 15 cm depth. Time lags of 2-4 days resulted
   in a reduction of the root mean square errors between volumetric soil
   moisture predicted from S-2 data and that measured by in situ sensors,
   from similar to 0.1 m(3)/m(3) to <0.06 m(3)/m(3). The surface moisture
   results for two grassland sites were analysed using statistical concepts
   based upon the temporal stability of soil water content, an ideal
   framework for the intermittent Sentinel-2 data in conditions of
   persistent cloud cover. The analysis could discriminate between
   different natural drainages and surface soil textures in grassland areas
   and could identify sub-surface artificial drainage channels. The
   techniques are transferable for land-use and agricultural management in
   diverse environmental conditions without the need for extensive and
   expensive in situ sensor networks.},

Title = {Coverage optimization of soil moisture wireless sensor networks based on
   adaptive Cauchy variant butterfly optimization algorithm},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {JUL 8},
Abstract = {Soil moisture wireless sensor networks (SMWSNs) are used in the field of
   information monitoring for precision farm irrigation, which monitors the
   soil moisture content and changes during crop growth and development
   through sensor nodes at the end. The control terminal adjusts the
   irrigation water volume according to the transmitted information, which
   is significant for increasing the crop yield. One of the main challenges
   of SMWSNs in practical applications is to maximize the coverage area
   under certain conditions of monitoring area and to minimize the number
   of nodes used. Therefore, a new adaptive Cauchy variant butterfly
   optimization algorithm (ACBOA) has been designed to effectively improve
   the network coverage. More importantly, new Cauchy variants and adaptive
   factors for improving the global and local search ability of ACBOA,
   respectively, are designed. In addition, a new coverage optimization
   model for SMWSNs that integrates node coverage and network quality of
   service is developed. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is compared
   with other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely, butterfly optimization
   algorithm (BOA), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), fruit fly
   optimization algorithm (FOA), and particle swarm optimization algorithm
   (PSO), under the conditions of a certain initial population size and
   number of iterations for the fairness and objectivity of simulation
   experiments. The simulation results show that the coverage rate of
   SMWSNs after ACBOA optimization increases by 9.09\%, 13.78\%, 2.57\%,
   and 11.11\% over BOA, ABC, FOA, and PSO optimization, respectively.},

Title = {Application of Hyperspectral Technology Combined With Bat
   Algorithm-AdaBoost Model in Field Soil Nutrient Prediction},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {100286-100299},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a hyperspectral soil nutrient estimation method
   based on the bat algorithm (BA)-AdaBoost model. The spectral
   reflectance, the first derivative of the reflectance, and the reciprocal
   logarithm of the reflectance are analyzed based on the 800 field soil
   samples and their hyperspectral data collected. The first derivative of
   the reciprocal logarithm of the reflectance and the sensitive band was
   extracted using the correlation coefficient method, and the correlation
   of the content of soil organic matter, phosphorus, and potassium was
   solved. The BA is used to optimize the two core parameters of the
   AdaBoost model (i.e., the maximum number of iterations (n) and the
   weight reduction coefficient (v) of the weak learner), the
   classification and regression trees(CART) decision tree is selected as
   the weak regression learner of the model, and the coefficient of
   determination is used as parameter optimization. Based on the objective
   function value, a BA-AdaBoost model was constructed to estimate soil
   organic matter and phosphorus and potassium contents. The results show
   that the BA-AdaBoost combined model can better search for globally
   optimal parameters. The AdaBoost model optimized by BA significantly
   improved accuracy and reliability. Among the three elements, soil
   organic matter estimation accuracy is the highest, and the coefficient
   of determination and the root mean square error are 0.867 and 0.151g .
   kg(-1), respectively. Compared with the model before optimization, the
   model accuracy and reliability improved by 29.0\% and 24.1\%,
   respectively. The results indicate that hyperspectral technology
   combined with the BA-AdaBoost model has certain application prospects in
   field soil nutrient estimation.},

Abstract = {Understanding soil moisture dynamics is crucial for crop growth. The
   digital mapping of field soil moisture distribution provides valuable
   information for agricultural water management. The optical satellite
   data provides fine scale soil moisture information for a region.
   However, these data are greatly limited due to cloud contamination and
   revisit period. Despite the reported beneficial effects of
   spatiotemporal fusion methods, the accurate estimates of high-resolution
   soil moisture through spatiotemporal fusion data are still unclear,
   particularly when using Sentinel-2/3 fusion images. This study
   introduces a new soil moisture estimation framework integrating
   spatio-temporal spectral information from Sentinel-2/3 fusion images and
   machine learning algorithm,and thus provide spatiotemporally continuous
   soil moisture estimation. The framework includes four fusion methods
   (ESTARRFM, Fit-FC, FSDAF and STFMF) and four machine learning models
   (PLSR, SVM, RF and GBRT). The feasibility of the framework was validated
   in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia, China. The results
   showed that the Sentinel-2/3 fused image generated by Fit-FC was
   visually the closest to the true image, followed by ESTARFM, FSDAF, and
   STFMF. The spatiotemporal fusion-machine learning estimation framework
   provided reliable estimation for multi-layer (0 20, 20 40 and 40 60 cm)
   soil water in the irrigation area. The dense time series of soil water
   generated by the framework facilitated the detection of irrigation
   events in the irrigated farmland. Our findings highlighted the
   effectiveness of Sentinel-2/3 fused images in providing high- resolution
   continuous daily monitoring of farmland soil water on a large scale.
   These high spatial-temporal resolution time series are valuable for
   monitoring crop growth and water resource management, contributing to
   further expanding the application of satellite remote sensing in
   precision agriculture.},

Abstract = {The estimation of topsoil water content is of primary interest in the
   framework of precision fanning, but, in general, such assessment is
   costly and complicated by several interfering factors which do not allow
   an accurate prediction. Proximal sensing can provide suitable
   technological facilities to support researchers and technicians in this
   task. GPR and EMI sensors are valuable instruments as they can provide
   very informative covariates to be used for improving soil water content
   estimation. In the present work, it was explored the single (EMI or GPR)
   and the combined (EMI + GPR) contribution of these proximal data
   sources. Furthermore, geostatistical (Ordinary Kriging and Kriging with
   external drift) and linear mixed effects models were applied to compare
   their respective predictive capabilities. As a result, GPR demonstrated
   to be more effective in estimating topsoil water content with respect to
   EMI but, combining both the information, an improvement in the
   prediction accuracy was observed. Moreover, adding more covariates in
   the models (GPR outcomes or GPR + EMI outcomes) allowed filtering out
   the structured spatial component of soil water content. Finally, the
   statistical approaches proved to behave very similarly, with a slight
   better performance of Kriging with external drift.},

Title = {Following the cosmic-ray-neutron-sensing-based soil moisture under
   grassland and forest: Exploring the potential of optical and SAR remote
   sensing},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {5},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Deriving soil moisture content (SMC) at the regional scale with
   different spatial and temporal land cover changes is still a challenge
   for active and passive remote sensing systems, often coped with machine
   learning methods. So far, the reference measurements of the data-driven
   approaches are usually based on point data, which entails a scale gap to
   the resolution of the remote sensing data. Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing
   (CRNS) indirectly provides SMC estimates of a soil volume covering more
   than 1 ha and vertical depth up to 80 cm and is thus able to narrow this
   scale gap. So far, the CRNS-based SMC has only been used as validation
   source of remote sensing based SMC products. Its beneficial large
   sensing volume, especially in depth, has not been exploited yet.
   However, the sensing volume of the CRNS, which is changing with
   hydrological conditions, bears challenges for the comparison with remote
   sensing observations. This study, for the fist time, aims to understand
   the direct linkage of optical (Sentinel 2) and SAR (Sentinel 1) data
   with CRNS-based SMC. Thereby, the CRNS-based SMC is obtained by an
   experimental CRNS cluster that covers the high temporal and spatial SMC
   variability of an entire pre-alpine subcatchment. Using different Random
   Forest regressions, we analyze the potentials and limitations of both
   remote sensing sensors to follow the CRNS-based SMC signal. Our results
   show that it is possible to link the CRNS-based SMC signal with SAR and
   optical remote sensing observations via Random Forest modelling. We
   found that Sentinel 2 data is able to separate wet from dry periods with
   a R2 of 0.68. It is less affected by the changing soil volume that
   contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal and it is able to assign a land
   cover specific SMC distribution. However, Sentinel 2 regression models
   are not accurate (R2 < 0.21) in mapping the CRNSbased SMC for the
   frequently mowed grassland areas of the study site. It requires soil
   type and topographical information to accurately follow the CRNS-based
   SMC signal with Random Forest regression. Sentinel 1 data instead is
   affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based
   SMC signal. It has reasonable model performance (R2 = 0.34) when the
   CRNS data correspond to surface SMC. Also for Sentinel 1 the retrieval
   is impacted by the mowing activities at the test site. When separating
   the CRNS data set into dry and wet periods, soil properties and
   topography are the main drivers of SMC estimation. Sentinel 1 or
   Sentinel 2 data add the existing temporal variability to the regression
   models. The analysis underlines the need of combining optical and SAR
   observations (Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2) as well as soil property and
   topographical information to understand and follow the CRNS-based SMC
   signal for different hydrological conditions and land cover types.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, a wide range of applications require near-real-time Surface
   Soil Moisture (SSM) data at high spatial resolution. However,
   operational passive microwave systems like SMOS and SMAP can only
   acquire such information at a relatively coarser resolution. Therefore,
   several downscaling algorithms have been developed to address this issue
   and provide SSM maps at a finer spatial scale. Users may, however, find
   it difficult to implement the downscaling algorithm due to the
   complexity of integrating various data sources. Disaggregation based on
   Physical and Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) is one of the
   algorithms that is widely accepted to downscale passive microwave SSM
   observations. But the complexity of modeling, the variety of data
   sources and formats of input data make it very difficult for users to
   implement the algorithm. Thus, we developed a Satellitebased
   Hydrological Monitoring System (SHMS), which facilitates this gap
   through the implementation of the DisPATCh algorithm to generate
   large-scale SSM maps with high resolution, which is achieved by
   combining SMAP and MODIS products. The System Usability Scale (SUS)
   method was used to evaluate the system's strengths and weaknesses. The
   SUS evaluation results show that 74.75\% of SHMS users are satisfied
   with the system's performance.},

Abstract = {Accurate large-scale soil moisture (SM) maps are crucial for
   catchment-scale hydrological models used for water resource management
   and warning systems for droughts, floods, and wildfires. SM can be
   mapped by mobile cosmic-ray neutron (CRN) systems of moderated detectors
   at homogeneous landscapes of similar soil and vegetation. In this study,
   we present a new approach for mobile CRN detection to perform to its
   full potential, where CRN measurements can also be converted to SM at
   heterogeneous landscapes. The approach is based solely on thermal and
   epithermal neutron datasets obtained from mobile dual-spectra CRN
   detection, combined with theoretical developments using a particle
   transport model. For each measurement point, the land cover type is
   identified using the thermal-to-epithermal (T/E) ratio, and the relevant
   neutron-count-to-soil-moisture conversion function is estimated from CRN
   stations located at the main land cover types in the catchment. With
   this approach, the requirement of collecting 100+ soil samples for each
   point along the survey route is omitted. We use this T/E-dependent
   approach to obtain SM maps from 12 CRN surveys and compare it with a
   simple approach where only the conversion function from the agricultural
   site is used. SM by the simple approach is comparable to the estimates
   of the agricultural stations of a capacitance sensor network, while the
   estimates of the T/E-dependent approach also compare well with the
   heathland and forest stations. With accurate SM estimates for all
   landcover types, the average error is reduced from 0.089 to 0.038 when
   comparing CRN SM with space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission
   estimates.

Title = {Soil phosphorus availability mediates facilitation dynamic in
   maize-grass pea intercropping system},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {234},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The intercropping-led diversified tillage is crucial for sustainable
   development in dryland agriculture. However, the plant-plant interaction
   transition and its effects on soil physiochemical characteristics along
   soil phosphorus (P) levels are not clear. To address this issue,
   maize-grass pea intercropping system was used to investigate the
   variations in plant-plant facilitation along soil P gradients (low- to
   high-P) and their effects on rhizosphere soil N and P availability and
   microbial biomass. The data showed that total net effect (NE) was always
   positive, indicating facilitative effects of intercropping on total
   community productivity. Specifically, the relative yield (RY) for both
   species was greater than 0.5 in the P-deficient soils, representing
   mutually facilitated effects. Yet, under the P-sufficient condition,
   maize and grass pea acted as facilitated species and facilitator
   respectively. Rhizosphere phosphatase activity was significantly
   enhanced in the P-deficient soils, accordingly fostering P
   mineralization for higher P availability and N utilization. The contents
   of microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (i.e., MBC, MBN and
   MBP) were evidently elevated in intercropping systems than those of
   mono-culture. Also, global meta-analysis verified above phenomenon,
   showing that high P addition decreased facilitation intensity with type
   shift, regarding plant productivity, N and P utilization and vice versa.
   We confirmed a relatively full picture of P-driven facilitation
   intensity and type shift along stress gradients by field observation and
   meta-analysis. The findings provided a new insight of biodiversity in
   soil physiochemical traits and also revealed a critical mechanism
   affecting resource utilization in the P-limited soils.},

Abstract = {In 2009, the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) was initiated as
   a community effort, funded by the European Space Agency, to serve as a
   centralised data hosting facility for globally available in situ soil
   moisture measurements (Dorigo et al., 2011b, a). The ISMN brings
   together in situ soil moisture measurements collected and freely shared
   by a multitude of organisations, harmonises them in terms of units and
   sampling rates, applies advanced quality control, and stores them in a
   database. Users can freely retrieve the data from this database through
   an online web portal (https://ismn.earth/en/, last access: 28 October
   2021). Meanwhile, the ISMN has evolved into the primary in situ soil
   moisture reference database worldwide, as evidenced by more than 3000
   active users and over 1000 scientific publications referencing the data
   sets provided by the network. As of July 2021, the ISMN now contains the
   data of 71 networks and 2842 stations located all over the globe, with a
   time period spanning from 1952 to the present. The number of networks
   and stations covered by the ISMN is still growing, and approximately 70
   \% of the data sets contained in the database continue to be updated on
   a regular or irregular basis. The main scope of this paper is to inform
   readers about the evolution of the ISMN over the past decade, including
   a description of network and data set updates and quality control
   procedures. A comprehensive review of the existing literature making use
   of ISMN data is also provided in order to identify current limitations
   in functionality and data usage and to shape priorities for the next
   decade of operations of this unique community-based data repository.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important state variable for land-atmosphere
   interactions. It is a vital land surface variable for research on
   hydrology, agriculture, climate, and drought monitoring. In current
   study, a soil moisture data assimilation framework has been developed by
   using the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and the proper
   orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based ensemble four-dimensional
   variational assimilation (PODEn4DVar) algorithm. Assimilation
   experiments were conducted at four agricultural sites in Pakistan by
   assimilating in-situ soil moisture observations. The results showed that
   it was a reliable system. To quantify further the feasibility of the
   data assimilation (DA) system, soil moisture observations from the top
   four soil-depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) were assimilated. The
   evaluation results indicated that the DA system improved soil moisture
   estimation. In addition, updating the soil moisture in the upper soil
   layers of CLM4.5 could improve soil moisture estimation in deeper soil
   layers {[}layer 7 (L7, 62.0 cm) and layer 8 (L8, 103.8 cm)]. To further
   evaluate the DA system, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs)
   were designed for Pakistan by assimilating daily observations. These
   idealized experiments produced statistical results that had higher
   correlation coefficients, reduced root mean square errors, and lower
   biases for assimilation, which showed that the DA system is able to
   produce and improve soil moisture estimation in Pakistan.},

   Products for Long-term Time Series Analysis},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role in the water-heat-energy
   exchange and water cycle of the land ecosystem. Long-term SM products
   are vital in the time series study of ecology and hydrology. Therefore,
   it is vital to extend the time span with limited SM monitoring sensors,
   since there is no single long-term SM product currently. In this study,
   an SM product prolonging method based on an artificial neural network
   (ANN) and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical
   products was proposed. The prolonging results of Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) and Fenyun-3B (FY3B) products were validated in Tibetan
   Plateau to present the feasibility of this method. The result shows this
   method is feasible in areas under medium vegetation cover (0.2 < NDVI <
   0.6), but it still needs to be improved in some areas (especially in
   areas with very high or very low NDVI). The prolonging data fits well (R
   = 0.84, RMSE < 0.06 cm(3)cm(-3)) with in situ measurements for both SMAP
   and FY-3B products. The generated long-term SM will benefit the global
   water cycle study.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are critical to pasture productivity;
   however, limited information is available on how the single and combined
   additions of N and P affect soil P fractions and seasonal changes in
   microbial and biochemical processes linked to P cycling under pasture
   systems. A two-year field trial was conducted where N (0 or 250 kg
   ha(-1) yr(-1)) and P (0 or 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were applied in a full
   factorial design to an intensively managed grass-pasture system. Changes
   in plant growth and nutrient uptake, soil microbial biomass P, soil
   phosphatase activities, and soil inorganic and organic P fractions were
   assessed by regular sampling. Phosphorus addition increased Olsen P and
   shoot P uptake but not shoot biomass compared to the control. In
   contrast, N addition decreased Olsen P by 23\% but increased both shoot
   biomass and P uptake by 1.6-fold, compared to the control. Microbial
   biomass P was irresponsive to N and P additions. Phosphatase enzyme
   activity significantly increased in summer under N addition, which was
   linked to labile organic P mineralization. After two growing seasons, N
   addition alone significantly decreased readily-available inorganic P,
   labile inorganic P, moderately labile inorganic P, and labile organic P
   by 75, 19, 7, and 28\%, respectively, compared to the control. On the
   other hand, combined N and P addition significantly decreased
   readily-available inorganic P, labile inorganic P, and labile organic P
   by 39, 26, and 28\%, respectively, but had no impact on moderately
   labile inorganic P compared to P addition alone. The findings of this
   study revealed that short-term N fertilization to N-limited
   grass-pastures can accelerate P cycling by mobilizing labile inorganic
   and organic P as well as moderately labile inorganic P pools. However, N
   fertilization combined with P applications exceeding plant requirements
   cannot mobilize moderately labile inorganic P, which accumulates under
   high P sorbing soils.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture content can be used to predict drought impact on
   agricultural yield better than precipitation. Remote sensing is viable
   source of soil moisture data in instrument-scarce areas. However,
   space-based soil moisture estimates lack suitability for daily and
   high-resolution agricultural, hydrological, and environmental
   applications. This study aimed to assess the potential of the random
   forest machine learning technique to enhance the spatial resolution of
   remote soil moisture products from the SMAP satellite. Models were built
   using random forest for spatial downscaling of SMAP-L3-E, then visually
   and statistically evaluated for disaggregation quality. The impact of
   topography, soil properties, and precipitation on the downscaled soil
   moisture was examined. The relationship between downscaled soil moisture
   and in-situ soil moisture was analyzed. The results indicate that the
   proposed method demonstrated spatial and hydrological coherence, along
   with a satisfactory downscaling quality. Statistical validation
   indicated suitable generalization error for scientific and practical use
   (RMSE < 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)). Random forest effectively achieved spatial
   downscaling of SMAP-L3-E in the study area. Principal component and
   spatial analysis revealed dependence of downscaled soil moisture on
   elevation, soil organic carbon content, clay content, and saturated
   hydraulic conductivity, mainly under near-saturation conditions.
   Regarding validation against in-situ data, downscaled soil moisture
   explained in-situ soil moisture well under low soil water content ( =
   0.624). Downscaling performance deteriorates for water contents between
   0.40 to 0.50 cm(3) cm(-3), suggesting inadequacy under near saturation
   conditions at a daily temporal frequency. However, coarser temporal
   aggregations (7 to 10 days) yielded an average 0.98 correlation
   coefficient, regardless of saturation conditions. These results could
   potentially be applied in irrigation planning, soil physics studies and
   hydrology monitoring, to forecasting the occurrence of droughts,
   leaching of contaminants, surface runoff modeling, carbon cycle studies,
   soil's capacity to store and provide nutrients.},

Title = {Interpreting effective hydrologic depth estimates derived from soil
   moisture remote sensing: A Bayesian non-linear modeling approach},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {908},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The water balance equation (WBE) describes how net water inflows into a
   system relate to storage changes over a time span (dt). This equation is
   fundamental in hydrologic studies, helping to determine water supply and
   elucidate the terrestrial water cycle. For land surface, the WBE links
   water fluxes like precipitation (P), evapotranspiration, drainage and
   surface runoff to soil moisture (SM) changes within a discrete soil
   layer (dSM). While traditional focus has been on the precision of the
   WBE-estimated fluxes, there has been increased recent interest in
   fitting the WBE using remotely-sensed P and SM data to infer water
   balance parameters, particularly the Delta Z that associates net fluxes
   and dSM within dt. However, obtaining physically interpretable WBE
   parameters like Delta Z is a potentially ill-posed problem due to
   simplifying assumptions imbedded in a WBE implementation, missing
   hydrologic constraints, and accuracy and revisit limitations in
   available remotely-sensed data. In addition, WBE parameters obtained
   from classical maximum likelihood estimation approaches can vary
   significantly. Here, using a Bayesian non-linear modeling approach, we
   demonstrate how these factors can impede the identification of useful
   Delta Z estimates. Specifically, we find that Delta Z estimates are
   likely to be spuriously biased due to limitations in the temporal
   resolution and accuracy of satellite-based dSM estimates - as well as
   the neglect of other hydrological components in the WBE. Maps showcasing
   the lower and upper bounds of the 94 \% HDI from our Bayesian model
   further elucidate these biases. Results suggests that estimates of Delta
   Z are effective in nature and great care should be exercised when
   attempting to interpret them physically. Instead, they should be defined
   as effective parameters reflecting the characteristics of their fitted
   remotely-sensed data sets. Drawing from current progress, accurate AZ
   estimates, informed by more advanced remote sensing techniques and
   precise WBE, will enhance our understanding of terrestrial water cycle.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an important biophysical parameter by which to
   evaluate water resource potential, especially for agricultural
   activities under the pressure of global warming. The recent advancements
   in different types of satellite imagery coupled with deep learning-based
   frameworks have opened the door for large-scale SM estimation. In this
   research, high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data and
   high temporal resolution soil moisture active passive (SMAP) SM data
   were combined to create short-term SM predictions that can accommodate
   agricultural activities in the field scale. We created a deep learning
   model to forecast the daily SM values by using time series of climate
   and radar satellite data along with the soil type and topographic data.
   The model was trained with static and dynamic features that influence SM
   retrieval. Although the topography and soil texture data were taken as
   stationary, SMAP SM data and Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter coefficients,
   including their ratios, and climate data were fed to the model as
   dynamic features. As a target data to train the model, we used in situ
   measurements acquired from the International Soil Moisture Network
   (ISMN). We employed a deep learning framework based on long short-term
   memory (LSTM) architecture with two hidden layers that have 32 unit
   sizes and a fully connected layer. The accuracy of the optimized LSTM
   model was found to be effective for SM prediction with the coefficient
   of determination (R-2) of 0.87, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046,
   unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.045, and mean absolute
   error (MAE) of 0.033. The model's performance was also evaluated
   concerning above-ground biomass, land cover classes, soil texture
   variations, and climate classes. The model prediction ability was lower
   in areas with high normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values.
   Moreover, the model can better predict in dry climate areas, such as
   arid and semi-arid climates, where precipitation is relatively low. The
   daily prediction of SM values based on microwave remote sensing data and
   geophysical features was successfully achieved by using an LSTM
   framework to assist various studies, such as hydrology and agriculture.},

Abstract = {High-quality soil moisture (SM) datasets are in great demand for
   climate, hydrology, and other fields, but detailed evaluation of SM
   products from various sources is scarce. Thus, using 670 SM stations
   worldwide, we evaluated and compared SM products from microwave remote
   sensing {[}Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) (C- and X-bands) and European Space Agency's
   Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)], land surface model {[}Global Land
   Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)], and reanalysis data {[}ECMWF
   Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and National Centers for Environmental
   Prediction (NCEP)] under different time scales and various climates and
   land covers. We find that: (a) ESA CCI and GLDAS have the closest values
   to the in situ SM on the annual scale, whereas others overestimate the
   SM; ERA-Interim (averaged R = 0.58) and ESA CCI (averaged R = 0.54)
   correlate best with the in situ data, while GLDAS performs worst. (b)
   Overall, the deviations of each product vary in seasons. ESA CCI and
   ERA-Interim products are closer to the in situ SM at seasonal scales,
   and AMSR-E and NCEP perform worst in December-February and June-August,
   respectively. (c) Except for NCEP and ERA-Interim, others can well
   reflect the intermonthly variation of the in situ SM. (d) Under various
   climates and land covers, AMSR-E products are less effective in cold
   climates, whereas GLDAS and NCEP products perform poorly in arid or
   temperate and dry climates. Moreover, the Bias and R of each SM product
   differ obviously under different forest types, especially the AMSR-E
   products. In summary, SM from ESA CCI is the best, followed by
   ERA-Interim product, and precipitation is an important auxiliary data
   for selecting high-quality SM stations and improving the accuracy of SM
   from GLDAS. These results can provide a reference for improving the
   accuracy of the above SM products.},

Abstract = {Non-ponded aerobic rice offers the opportunity for substantial global
   savings of irrigated water. Site and environment specific soil tension
   thresholds have been identified for non-ponded rice production to save
   water without adverse yield consequences. However, soil tension readings
   are point-source measures that are not necessarily representative of a
   given irrigation area/paddy and become costly when required in each
   paddy. Remote sensing offers spatial advantages and has been
   demonstrated in many crops to accurately estimate crop
   evapotranspiration (ETc), which is often used to schedule irrigation.
   This study uses soil moisture tension (SMT) data measured in a
   commercial aerobic rice experiment conducted in temperate Australia on a
   heavy clay soil to demonstrate the relationship between soil tension and
   remotely sensed estimated cumulative ETc between irrigation events using
   open access satellite imagery. The model was used to predict SMT in the
   second growing season during the vegetative period after establishment
   until PI with a root mean squared error of +/- 5.8 kPa. This
   demonstrates the ability of irrigators to schedule irrigation in water
   saving rice using open satellite-derived data that can be incorporated
   into an automated irrigation system, without the need for costly
   in-field soil moisture sensors. Future research to integrate forecast
   crop evapotranspiration could enable soil moisture forecasting days in
   advance, providing irrigators more time to plan irrigation activities.},

Abstract = {The effects of drought on tree mortality at forest stands are not
   completely understood. For assessing their water supply, knowledge of
   the small-scale distribution of soil moisture as well as its temporal
   changes is a key issue in an era of climate change. However, traditional
   methods like taking soil samples or installing data loggers solely
   collect parameters of a single point or of a small soil volume.
   Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a suitable method for
   monitoring soil moisture changes and has rarely been used in forests.
   This method was applied at two forest sites in Bavaria, Germany to
   obtain high-resolution data of temporal soil moisture variations.
   Geoelectrical measurements (2D and 3D) were conducted at both sites over
   several years (2015-2018/2020) and compared with soil moisture data
   (matric potential or volumetric water content) for the monitoring plots.
   The greatest variations in resistivity values that highly correlate with
   soil moisture data were found in the main rooting zone. Using the ERT
   data, temporal trends could be tracked in several dimensions, such as
   the interannual increase in the depth of influence from drought events
   and their duration, as well as rising resistivity values going along
   with decreasing soil moisture. The results reveal that resistivity
   changes are a good proxy for seasonal and interannual soil moisture
   variations. Therefore, 2D- and 3D-ERT are recommended as comparatively
   non-laborious methods for small-spatial scale monitoring of soil
   moisture changes in the main rooting zone and the underlying subsurface
   of forested sites. Higher spatial and temporal resolution allows a
   better understanding of the water supply for trees, especially in times
   of drought.},

Abstract = {The vegetation canopy parameters in the water cloud model originate from
   the surface spectrum of the vegetation canopy and do not fully consider
   its spatial structure, biomass, and water content. This study resolved
   this problem using a new vegetation canopy water content calculation
   method to improve the water cloud model. Our results showed that the
   novel calculation method, which considers the vertical and horizontal
   structure, biomass, and the water content of the canopy, is suitable for
   obtaining a more accurate estimation of the vegetation canopy water
   content. Additionally, this improved water cloud model (IWCM) was used
   to retrieve the soil moisture content of often greenwood, deciduous
   forest, mixed forest-, composite shrub grass-, and grassland-covered
   areas. The tenfold cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) of
   the soil moisture content model was 0.43. The relative root mean square
   error (rRMSE) was 21.89\%. When applied to deciduous forest, composite
   shrub grass, and grassland-covered areas, R-2 = 0.57 and rRMSE = 16.48\%
   were obtained. When the IWCM was applied only to the composite shrub
   grass- and grassland-covered areas, the R-2 was 0.76, and rRMSE was
   9.8\%. Therefore, the IWCM provides new insights regarding the remote
   sensing quantitative inversion of soil moisture content in areas with
   high vegetation density and woodland cover, which can be applied in the

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in various fields such as
   agriculture, hydrology, and land-atmosphere interactions. This study
   aims to evaluate the performance of the categorical boosting algorithm
   (CatBoost) in comparison to other multiple-boosting algorithms for SM
   prediction. Appropriate feature selection is vital for achieving
   accurate predictions, and this study focuses on identifying relevant
   features and assessing CatBoost's suitability for the task. The study
   incorporates several boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting
   Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light
   Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and CatBoost to estimate SM.
   Results indicate that radar backscatter coefficient, soil roughness, and
   digital elevation model (DEM) are crucial features for SM retrieval.
   Comparatively, CatBoost outperforms GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM in
   various feature combinations. The most favorable results are obtained
   when utilizing all features as inputs for the algorithm. These optimal
   results yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.40 vol.\%, mean relative
   error (MRE) of 0.16 vol.\%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.26
   vol.\%, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73. Additionally, the
   study analyzes the inversion results for different ranges of SM and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Within the range of SM
   from 0 to 25 vol.\% and NDVI from 0 to 0.7, utilizing all features
   yields the most accurate results. Using CatBoost, this approach achieves
   an MAE of 1.52 vol.\%, MRE of 0.12 vol.\%, RMSE of 2.11 vol.\%, and R of
   0.81. The study suggests that applying boosting algorithms, especially
   CatBoost, holds promise in accurately estimating surface SM.},

Abstract = {Obtaining accurate soil moisture data from sensors in automated
   monitoring networks is critical as these data are increasingly used for
   research in soil hydrology, ecohydrology, and related disciplines. One
   of the earliest such networks is the Oklahoma Mesonet, which monitors
   soil matric potential using heat dissipation sensors. Various
   calibration equations have been proposed for those sensors, and there is
   a need to compare and validate the performance of those equations,
   especially for matric potentials < -150 kPa. A laboratory experiment was
   conducted in silt loam soil using a sand-kaolin box and a pressure plate
   apparatus with matric potentials ranging from 0 to -1500 kPa. The
   calibration equations included Starks' equation, Flint et al.'s
   equation, Schneider et al.'s equation, and a new logistic equation. The
   upper limit of the sensors was -9 kPa, and the sensors remained
   responsive at -1500 kPa matric potential. The logistic equation produced
   the lowest root mean squared error (34 kPa), followed by Flint et al.'s
   equation (192 kPa), Starks' equation (295 kPa), and Schneider et al.'s
   equation (463 kPa). After recalibration of the coefficients in the three
   preexisting equations, their performances improved, with all RMSE values
   <= 251 kPa; however, the logistic equation still provided superior
   accuracy. The logistic equation effectively removed an similar to 0.02
   cm(3) cm(-3) positive bias in soil water content that resulted from use
   of the original parameterization of Schneider et al.'s equation. This
   logistic equation is recommended for use with past and future data from
   the Oklahoma Mesonet's heat dissipation sensors.},

Abstract = {Reanalysis and remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) products are important
   for monitoring hydrology and the terrestrial carbon cycle, especially in
   water-limited arid regions. However, it is essential to assess the
   reliability of SM products before they are used. In this study, surface
   SM from the European Reanalysis-Interim v5 (ERA5), Essential Climate
   Variables (ECV), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS) Land
   Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation
   System (GLDAS) were assessed based on in-situ data and the
   Three-Cornered Hat (TCH) approach in a typical arid region, Central Asia
   (CA). The validation based on in -situ data indicated that all three
   products underestimated the observed surface SM, except for ERA5. The
   ERA5 SM was closest to the in-situ observations, averaging a higher
   correlation coefficient of 0.59, followed by the GLDAS, ECV, and FLDAS.
   The TCH method revealed low uncertainties (<0.05 m3/m3) for all four SM
   products, and high uncertainties were found at high altitudes. For ERA5
   and ECV SM products, the uncertainty is high in the shrublands and
   forests, respectively. FLDAS and GLDAS SM products performed better in
   terms of uncertainty compared to ERA5 and ECV, with an average
   uncertainty below 0.03 m3/m3, except for forests. The above assessment
   results indicate that, compared with the other three SM products, ERA5
   has a better performance and more potential for application in CA. There
   was an upward trend in surface SM from 1982 to 2018 in CA. The
   relationship between the four SM products and aridity index and drought
   events showed that GLDAS could capture the hydrothermal conditions and
   drought events, followed by FLDAS, ERA5, and ECV. Our research is
   intended to provide some reference for the application of gridded SM
   products to ecosystem and water resources monitoring in arid regions.},

Abstract = {Satellite soil moisture (SM) has been increasingly available and the use
   of SM-based indices has a great potential for agricultural drought
   monitoring. This study evaluates the performance of two satellite SM
   products, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP), on drought detection and assessment in the North
   China Plain (NCP) over the period of 2015-2018, with a comparison
   between two SMbased drought indices, Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) and
   Soil Moisture Condition Index (SMCI). Vegetation Condition Index (VCI)
   and Vegetation Drought Index (VDI) were adopted as the reference
   indices. Overall, SMAP outperformed SMOS in SM data validation as well
   as drought detection in the NCP region. A simple bias correction of the
   satellite SM data was able to improve their performance in
   characterizing agricultural drought via SM-based indices. Compared with
   SWDI, SMCI appeared to be the more appropriate index for drought
   monitoring, by showing a better agreement with both VCI and VDI in terms
   of drought characteristics (i.e. spatial distribution, drought category
   and frequency), though both SM-based indices overestimated drought
   severity to some extent. A simply SM-based drought indicator could be
   effective when satellite SM was applied for capturing agricultural
   drought, and a full consideration of longer term satellite data might be
   necessary.},

Abstract = {Per capita arable land is decreasing due to the rapidly increasing
   population, and fresh water is becoming scarce and more expensive.
   Therefore, farmers should continue to use technology and innovative
   solutions to improve efficiency, save input costs, and optimise
   environmental resources (such as water). In the case study presented in
   this paper, the Global Navigation Satellite System interferometric
   reflectometry (GNSS-IR) technique was used to monitor soil moisture
   during 66 d, from 3 December 2018 to 6 February 2019, in the
   installations of the Cajamar Centre of Experiences, Paiporta, Valencia,
   Spain. Two main objectives were pursued. The first was the extension of
   the technique to a multi-constellation solution using GPS, GLONASS, and
   GALILEO satellites, and the second was to test whether mass-market
   sensors could be used for this technique. Both objectives were achieved.
   At the same time that the GNSS observations were made, soil samples
   taken at 5 cm depth were used for soil moisture determination to
   establish a reference data set. Based on a comparison with that
   reference data set, all GNSS solutions, including the three
   constellations and the two sensors (geodetic and mass market), were
   highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient between 0.7 and 0.85.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing presents great potential for soil moisture mapping,
   although a lack of high-resolution, all-season suitable data and
   model-based complications hinders continuous mapping at the farm scale.
   The current study attempts to access optical (Sentinel-2) and microwave
   (Sentinel-1) based Water Cloud Model (WCM), optical and/or thermal-based
   Thermal-Optical TRApezoid Model (TOTRAM), and Optical TRApezoid Model
   (OPTRAM) utilizing Landsat-8 data, and an ensemble of these three models
   synergistically using microwave, optical and thermal remote sensing data
   for fourteen dates spanning two post-monsoon periods over a semi-arid
   irrigated agricultural farm. The ensemble model developed with Gradient
   Boosting Machine (GBM) offered a superior SSM estimate for the entire
   crop growth season. The ensemble model had the lowest RMSE (0.053 m3
   m-3), followed by OPTRAM (SWIR2) (0.06 m3 m-3), while TOTRAM recorded
   the highest RMSE (0.092 m3 m-3), even though the model performances
   varied throughout crop growth cycles. For SSM mapping in the early
   phases of crop growth, WCM or TOTRAM were found superior, while during
   the latter growth stages, the performance of OPTRAM was better. In
   contrast to TOTRAM, which needs local calibration as the land surface
   temperature is sensitive to atmospheric conditions, the study emphasizes
   the shortcomings of WCM in terms of calibration requirements for
   changing vegetation structure utilizing in situ data. OPTRAM is suitable
   for generating SSM maps in semi-arid environments with a predominance of
   clear skies throughout the post-monsoon season. It is straightforward,
   low data, and resource intensive with universal surface reflectance-soil
   moisture association. The ensemble technique can be recommended for
   farm-level irrigation mapping over a post-monsoon period.},

   retrieval due to not considering the impact of soil salinity. Then,
   three typical saline soil dielectric constant models were validated and
   compared based on the experimental measurement datasets. Results show
   that the WYR saline soil dielectric constant model has excellent
   performance. The soil salinity mainly affects the imaginary part of the
   dielectric constant and the effect of salinity on the soil dielectric
   constant is more significant when the SM has larger values. In addition,
   in retrieving SM with soil salinity more than 10 g/kg, the retrieval
   result of SM has an absolute error of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) and a relative
   error of 5\% when not considering the soil salinity impact. In
   retrieving SM with soil salinity less than 10 g/kg, the retrieved
   SMerror increased by 2\%, and the absolute error increased by 0.01
   m(3)/m(3) as soil salinity increased by 3 g/kg. We believe that The
   study will give a theoretical reference for establishing the SM
   retrieval model in saline soil areas using microwave data.},

Title = {A profile shape correction to reduce the vertical sensitivity of
   cosmic-ray neutron sensing of soil moisture},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {In recent years, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has shown a large
   potential among proximal sensing techniques to monitor soil moisture
   noninvasively, with high frequency and a large support volume (radius up
   to 240 m and sensing depth up to 80 cm). This signal is, however, more
   sensitive to closer distances and shallower depths. Inherently,
   CRNS-derived soil moisture is a spatially weighted value, different from
   an average soil moisture as retrieved by a sensor network. In this
   study, we systematically test a new profile shape correction on
   CRNS-derived soil moisture, based on additional soil moisture profile
   measurements and vertical unweighting, which is especially relevant
   during pronounced wetting or drying fronts. The analyses are conducted
   with data collected at four contrasting field sites, each equipped with
   a CRNS probe and a distributed soil moisture sensor network. After
   applying the profile shape correction on CRNS-derived soil moisture, it
   is compared with the sensor network average. Results show that the
   influence of the vertical sensitivity of CRNS on integral soil moisture
   values is successfully reduced. One to three properly located profile
   measurements within the CRNS support volume improve the performance. For
   the four investigated field sites, the RMSE decreased 11-53\% when only
   one profile location was considered. We therefore recommend to install
   along with a CRNS at least one soil moisture profile in a radial
   distance <100 m and a measurement depth down to 50 cm.
   Profile-shape-corrected, CRNS-derived soil moisture is an unweighted
   integral soil moisture over the support volume, which is easier to
   interpret and easier to use for further applications.},

Title = {Tracking tree growth through satellite soil moisture monitoring: A case
   study of <i>Pinus halepensis</i> in Spain},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {235},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {In this study, the ability of satellite soil moisture to track tree
   growth is analyzed. Despite the reticence of using satellite soil
   moisture data in forest areas, there is evidence that in some cases,
   good and reliable results have been obtained. Forests cover very
   important continental areas and have great importance in many natural
   processes related to water resources, biodiversity and climate. For
   these reasons, it is interesting to investigate the applicability of
   remote sensing soil moisture products for new applications in these
   environments. In the present study, the CCI (Climate Change Initiative,
   Global Monitoring of Essential Climate Variables, European Space Agency)
   soil moisture (CCISM) database has been correlated with the tree-growth
   series of 22 samples of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) in Spain in
   different locations and environmental conditions. Aleppo pine is the
   most widespread pine species in the Mediterranean basin, and therefore,
   it is highly representative of the bioclimatic conditions in these
   water-limited environments. The series spans from 1978 to 2016, and the
   daily CCISM has been correlated with the annual tree-growth anomalies.
   The daily CCISM has been obtained using a moving window scheme with 1-,
   7-, 15- and 30-day averages, starting on October 1st of the previous
   year and finishing on December 31st of the corresponding year. Another
   soil moisture product (Lisflood model) and precipitation have also been
   used in a similar approach to strengthen the assessment analysis. The
   results obtained show a clear temporal pattern of the relationship
   between satellite soil moisture and Aleppo pine tree growth, and the
   influence of soil moisture on tree-growth dynamics increases with
   reduced water availability. The CCISM was able to detect a bimodal
   pattern of tree growth with a maximum in May and a secondary peak in
   autumn. This temporal pattern was much clearer than that obtained using
   the modeled soil moisture and the precipitation. This study proves that
   satellite soil moisture is sensitive enough to track the phenology of
   this forest species. The results obtained demonstrate that satellite
   soil moisture data could be suitable for use in forest environments and
   for new applications.},

Title = {Modelling soil moisture and daily actual evapotranspiration: Integrating
   remote sensing surface energy balance and 1D Richards equation},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {128},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial component of the soil -
   plant-atmosphere system. In semi -arid Mediterranean regions, most land
   water loss occurs through ET, encompassing both evaporation from the
   earth ` s surface and plant transpiration. A comprehensive understanding
   of the actual ET spatiotemporal dynamics is critically important for
   hydrological modelling and effective water resource management. This
   significance is further pronounced considering the growing stress on
   water resources and the potential influence of climate change on water
   fluxes. Remote sensing (RS) provides long-term, high-resolution data
   that can contribute to the monitoring and management of natural
   ecosystems. Surface energy balance (SEB) methods relying on satellite
   remote sensing have proven effective in measuring actual
   evapotranspiration (ET a eb ) across different scales. However, their
   applicability may be constrained by interruptions in image acquisition
   caused by cloud cover and/or the spatio-temporal resolution limitations
   of satellites. In this research, a model-based methodology is suggested
   for simulating the dynamics of the soil - plant-atmosphere system and
   for estimating the daily actual evapotranspiration (ET p act ) of a
   Mediterranean Maquis ecosystem in northwest Sardinia. The model
   integrates ET a eb estimates obtained from the SEBAL model utilizing
   Landsat-8 data, satellite-derived vegetation indices, on-site
   measurements of potential evapotranspiration, and the mono-dimensional
   transient flow Richards equation for simulating soil moisture within the
   root zone. By combining these elements, the proposed model provides a
   more comprehensive and accurate estimate of the ET p act between Landsat
   acquisitions. The SEBAL model showed satisfactory performance in
   estimating actual evapotranspiration (ET a eb ) on satellite acquisition
   days, with an average error of 17 \% compared to Eddy Covariance
   measurements. In addition, the integrated modelling approach yielded an
   ET p act average estimation error of +/- 37 \% in the whole studied
   period. The soil moisture simulation by the model had a notable accuracy
   with an average error of 7.1 \%. Temporal analysis showed that the model
   effectively simulated ET p act and soil moisture under both dry and wet
   conditions, exhibiting similar monthly and daily variations as observed
   data. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis revealed that the stress index
   significantly improved the model ` s accuracy, while vegetation dynamics
   had a lower impact. Overall, the proposed model is a valuable tool for
   estimating ET p act in semi -arid Mediterranean regions, providing
   important information for water resource management and conservation
   efforts. Further application and validation of the model are recommended
   as new data becomes accessible, especially in areas characterized by
   cropped and irrigated agriculture. In future work, we aim to spatialize
   the Richards equation and integrate a multidimensional water balance
   hydrologic model.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED GEOPHYSICS},

Volume = {169},

Abstract = {Loop-loop electromagnetic induction (EMI) has proven to be efficient for
   fast and real-time soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
   measurements. It is important to develop robust and accurate inversion
   strategies to obtain soil electromagnetic conductivity image (EMCI) from
   ECa data. Moreover, obtaining an accurate nonlinear relationship between
   subsurface electrical conductivity (sigma) and water content (theta)
   plays a key role for soil moisture monitoring using EMI. Here, we
   incorporated probabilistic inversion of multi-configuration ECa data
   with dimensionality reduction technique through the discrete cosine
   transform (DCT) using training image (TI)-based parametrization to
   retrieve soil EMCI. The ECa data were measured repeatedly along a 10 m
   transect using a CMD mini-Explorer sensor. Time-lapse reference data
   were collected as well to benchmark the inversion results and to find
   the in-situ relationship between sigma and theta. To convert the
   inversely estimated time-lapse EMCI to the soil moisture, we examined
   two approaches, namely, Rhoades et al. (1976) model and artificial
   neural network (ANN). The proposed inversion strategy estimated the soil
   EMCI with an excellent agreement with the reference counterpart.
   Moreover, the ANN approach demonstrated superiorities than the commonly
   used petrophysical model of Rhoades et al. (1976) to obtain
   spatiotemporal images of theta from time-lapse EMCI. The results
   demonstrated that incorporation of the DCT-based probabilistic inversion
   of ECa data with the ANN approach offers a great promise for accurate
   characterization of the temporal wetting front and root zone soil
   moisture. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the ability of machine learning models to

   multispectral remote sensing carried out using an unoccupied aircraft
   system (UAS). In addition to multispectral images, we use terrain
   attributes derived from a digital elevation model and hydrological
   variables of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as
   covariates to predict surface soil moisture. We tested four different
   machine learning algorithms and interrogated the models to rank the
   importance of different variables and to understand their relationship
   with surface soil moisture. All the machine learning algorithms we
   tested were able to predict soil moisture with good accuracy. The
   boosted regression tree algorithm was marginally the best, with a mean
   absolute error of 3.8\% volumetric moisture content. Variable importance
   analysis revealed that the four most important variables were
   precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential
   evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results
   demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous
   terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing
   and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance
   and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for
   management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit

Title = {Propagation of soil moisture sensing uncertainty into estimation of
   total soil water, evapotranspiration and irrigation decision-making},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {243},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Soil moisture sensors are subject to uncertainty (inaccuracy) in
   measuring soil water status, that hinders various applications. User
   groups (researchers and growers/advisers) rely on these sensors for
   estimating critical agricultural water management decisions and
   information such as total soil water in the crop root zone (TSW), crop
   evapotranspiration (ETc) and predicting irrigation triggers (IT), i.e.,
   when TSW is equal to or lower than readily available water. There is a
   lack of translation of errors in sensor-reported soil moisture
   (theta(v)) into TSW, ETc, and IT, which is critical to farm-level
   decision-making as well as research assessments. Nine soil moisture
   sensors (based on principles of time-domain reflectometry, capacitance
   and electrical resistance) were investigated in field conditions for
   silt loam and loamy sand soils under two installation orientations
   (vertical and horizontal) during two growing seasons (2017 and 2018).
   Accurate representation of TSW, ETc, and IT was found to be a function
   of sensor-type, soil-type as well as calibration-type {[}factory
   calibration (F.C.) vs. site-specific calibration (S.S.C.)]. Sensor
   installation orientation did not affect sensor accuracy. Uncertainties
   in estimation of TSW, ETc and IT were quantified under each condition of
   use, and sensors were comparatively ranked for effective selection. It
   was found that all sensors underestimated ETc in silt loam soil. The
   deviation of sensor-measured ETc from true ETc ranged from -14 to -31
   \%, which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type
   impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil-vegetation
   system being monitored. Sensors showed both overstimation and
   underestimation of ETc in loamy sand soil with deviations of
   sensor-estimated ETc from true ETc ranging from 14 to -61 \%. The S.S.C.
   resulted in 45 and 17 \% improvement in TSW and ETc in silt loam soil,
   respectively, and 42, 80 and 86 \% improvement observed in TSW, IT and
   ETc in loamy sand soil, respectively. The research findings showed that
   suitability of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target
   metrics are used as criteria. These findings emphasize the need for
   evaluating soil moisture sensors based on practical and
   application-oriented criteria, in addition to reliance on theta(v)
   accuracy. To the best of authors' knowledge, this research is the first
   to translate traditional theta(v) accuracy assessments into practical
   and application-oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for
   these specific applications. Sensor rankings and uncertainty associated
   with their use presented here will allow diverse users to effectively
   identify sensors for targeted applications in water management
   decision-making and research.},

Title = {Inversion of Soil Moisture on Farmland Areas Based on SSA-CNN Using
   Multi-Source Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {10},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a crucial factor in the field of meteorology,
   hydrology, and agricultural sciences. In agricultural production,
   surface soil moisture (SSM) is crucial for crop yield estimation and
   drought monitoring. For SSM inversion, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   offers a trustworthy data source. However, for agricultural fields, the
   use of SAR data alone to invert SSM is susceptible to the influence of
   vegetation cover. In this paper, based on Sentinel-1 microwave remote
   sensing data and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, a convolution
   neural network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-CNN) was
   suggested to invert farmland SSM. The feature parameters were first
   extracted from pre-processed remote sensing data. Then, the correlation
   analysis between the extracted feature parameters and field measured SSM
   data was carried out, and the optimal combination of feature parameters
   for SSM inversion was selected as the input data of the subsequent
   models. To enhance the performance of the CNN, the hyper-parameters of
   CNN were optimized using SSA, and the SSA-CNN model was built for SSM
   inversion based on the obtained optimal hyper-parameter combination.
   Three typical machine learning approaches, including generalized
   regression neural network, random forest, and CNN, were used for
   comparison to show the efficacy of the suggested method. With an average
   coefficient of determination of 0.80, an average root mean square error
   of 2.17 vol.\%, and an average mean absolute error of 1.68 vol.\%, the
   findings demonstrated that the SSA-CNN model with the optimal feature
   combination had a better accuracy among the 4 models. In the end, the
   SSM of the study region was inverted throughout four phenological
   periods using the SSA-CNN model. The inversion results indicated that
   the suggested method performed well in local situations.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological processes in ecosystems
   and regulates water and energy exchanges between the surface and the
   atmosphere. Global coverage of surface soil moisture (SSM) satellite
   estimates makes them a fundamental source of information, while the
   validation of these estimates is usually based on in situ measurements,
   ideally from networks that cover areas similar to the satellite data
   resolution. However, as we expose in this study, both SSM data sources
   face challenges over extremely flat regions with large SSM variability.
   A homogenous farming region in the subhumid Pampas of Argentina,
   characterized by a large interannual rainfall variability as well as a
   marked annual cycle of rainfall and cropping, was taken as a case study.
   The region is almost devoid of irrigation and drainage infrastructure,
   is subject to large episodic flood and waterlogging events and holds an
   in situ network belonging to the Argentinean National Commission for
   Space Activities. This in situ network was set to evaluate the soil
   moisture estimated by satellite missions, such as SMAP and SAOCOM.
   However, several of these sites have been placed close to homesteads in
   a more uniform perennial vegetation than the prevailing seasonal crop.
   In this work, we examine how this placement bias influences SSM dynamics
   and its interpretation. We find that in situ data fails to capture the
   large seasonal and daily SSM variability caused by the cropping dynamics
   as well as the situation of waterlogging. As for the satellite SSM
   estimates, provided by the SMOS and SMAP missions in this study, while
   they capture the impact of cropping on SSM, data gaps can hinder robust
   statistical analysis. During periods of waterlogging, SSM values can lie
   outside the dynamic range considered valid by satellite missions, and
   thus are usually removed by users, creating `blind spots' for high soil
   water content stages in flood-prone lands. Our study underlines the
   importance of using multiple sources of information to interpret the
   hydrological status, including data from in situ measurements and remote
   sensing estimations of SSM as well as, when available, locally collected
   information such as reports from national, sub-national and private
   agro-industrial agencies.},

Title = {Potential of L- and C- Bands Polarimetric SAR Data for Monitoring Soil
   Moisture over Forested Sites},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {This study investigates the potential of L- and C- bands Polarimetric
   Synthetic Aperture Radar (PolSAR) data to monitor soil moisture over the
   forested sites of SMAP Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). The
   optimal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters to
   characterize the soil moisture were determined based on L-band
   Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), C-band
   RADARSAT-2, and ground measurements composed of soil and vegetation
   parameters collected during SMAPVEX12. Linear and circular
   backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)) and polarimetric parameters such
   as correlation coefficients (rho(HHVV)) and phase difference (phi(HHVV))
   between HH and VV, pedestal height (PH), entropy (H), anisotropy (A),
   alpha angle, surface (Ps), and double bounce (Pd) powers were used to
   develop the relationships with soil moisture. The analysis of these
   relationships shows that over the forested sites of SMAPVEX12: (a) at
   L-band several optimal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric
   parameters allow the monitoring of soil moisture, particularly the
   linear and circular sigma(0) (r = 0.60-0.96), Ps (r = 0.59-0.84), Pd (r
   = 0.60-0.82), rho(HHHV)\_30 degrees, rho(VVHV)\_30 degrees,
   phi(HHHV)\_30 degrees and phi(HHVV)\_30 degrees (r = 0.56-0.81).
   However, compared to the results obtained with sigma(0), there is no
   added value of the polarimetric parameters for soil moisture retrievals.
   (b) at C-band, only a few polarimetric parameters phi(HHHV), phi(VVHV),
   and phi(HHVV) are correlated with soil moisture (r = similar to 0.90).
   They can contribute to soil moisture retrievals over forested sites when
   L-band data are not available.},

Abstract = {Exploring the impact of different monitoring angles from unmanned aerial
   vehicle (UAV) on the monitoring accuracy of soil moisture content (SMC)
   is crucial for precision irrigation. To this end, experiment was
   conducted to monitor the SMC of winter wheat at different growth stages
   under different irrigation treatments in Yangling, Shaanxi, China. At a
   solar zenith angle of 45 degrees, multispectral remote sensing data from
   a UAV were collected at thirteen different monitoring zenith angles.
   Simultaneously, the SMC in the wheat root zone was measured. From the
   UAV multispectral images, spectral reflectance was extracted for the
   construction of vegetation indices. Then the correlation between the
   vegetation indices and the measured SMC was analyzed. With the
   vegetation indices as input variables, SMC monitoring models were
   constructed using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Random Forest (RF),
   and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The study also examined the
   effect of specific angles (hotspot and dark spot angles) on the
   estimation accuracy of the SMC at the nadir angle. The results indicated
   that different monitoring angles significantly impact the SMC estimation
   accuracy. Band reflectance and vegetation indices exhibited significant
   peak values and angular effects at the monitoring zenith angle of 45
   degrees. The models achieved the optimal inversion accuracy at the
   hotspot angle (at a monitoring zenith angle of 45 degrees in the solar
   principal plane), and the accuracy was ranked as follows: BPNN (R-2 =
   0.71; RMSE = 1.69) > ELM (R-2 = 0.52; RMSE = 1.94) > RF (R-2 = 0.48;
   RMSE = 2.10). By eliminating shadows at the nadir angle through the
   threshold of dark spot, inversion accuracy similar to the hotspot
   direction is achieved. This study provides a basis for appropriate
   selection of UAV flight angles for the monitoring of SMC in the root
   zone of winter wheat.},

Abstract = {The North China Plain is an important area for agricultural economic
   development in China. But water shortages, severe groundwater
   over-exploitation and drought problems make it difficult to exercise the
   topographic resource advantages of the plain. Therefore, the precise
   monitoring of soil moisture is of great significance for the rational
   use of water resources. Soil characteristics vary in natural farmland
   ecosystems, crops are constrained by multiple compound stresses and the
   precise extraction of soil moisture stress is a difficult and critical
   problem. The long time series was decomposed via complete ensemble
   empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to obtain
   different intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and the statistical
   descriptors of each component were calculated to realize the precise
   discrimination of soil moisture stress. A quantitative evaluation model
   of soil moisture was established, and the different noise addition
   ratios and modeling types were set respectively to investigate the
   optimal inversion model. The results showed that: (1) The reconstruction
   error of the CEEMDAN was small and almost 0; it had a high
   reconstruction accuracy and was more suitable for the decomposition of
   the long time series. The first two components, IMF1 and IMF2, were soil
   moisture stress subsequences, and it could effectively reflect the
   moisture stress situation. (2) The inversion model performed well when
   epsilon was 0.05 and the model type was quadratic, with a coefficient of
   determination R2 of 0.98, which gave a better fit and less error. (3)
   The overall soil moisture content in the study area was low, basically
   in the range of 6.9\% to 15.7\%, with the central part, especially the
   south-central part, being the most affected by soil moisture stress, and
   the overall impact of soil moisture stress showed a decreasing trend
   from February to May. The utilization of CEEMDAN further enhances the
   accuracy of soil moisture inversion in agricultural fields, realizing
   the effective application of remote sensing observation technology and
   time-frequency analysis technology in the field of soil moisture
   research.},

   Retrieval and Monitoring Based on Optical Images},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As a basic agricultural parameter in the formation, transformation, and
   consumption of surface water resources, soil moisture has a very
   important influence on the vegetation growth, agricultural production,
   and healthy operation of regional ecosystems. The Aksu river basin is a
   typical semi-arid agricultural area which seasonally suffers from water
   shortage. Due to the lack of knowledge on soil moisture change, the
   water management and decision-making processes have been a difficult
   issue for local government. Therefore, soil moisture monitoring by
   remote sensing became a reasonable way to schedule crop irrigation and
   evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Compared to in situ measurements,
   the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of soil water content is
   convenient and can be repetitively applied over a large area. To verify
   the applicability of the typical drought index to the rapid acquisition
   of soil moisture in arid and semi-arid regions, this study simulated,
   compared, and validated the effectiveness of soil moisture inversion.
   GF-1 WFV images, Landsat 8 OLI images, and the measured soil moisture
   data were used to determine the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), the
   Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), and the Vegetation Adjusted
   Perpendicular Drought Index (VAPDI). First, the determination
   coefficients of the correlation analyses on the PDI, MPDI, VAPDI, and
   measured soil moisture in the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth layers
   based on the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI images were good. Notably, in
   the 0-10 cm depth layers, the average determination coefficient was
   0.68; all models met the accuracy requirements of soil moisture
   inversion. Both indicated that the drought indices based on the Near
   Infrared (NIR)-Red spectral space derived from the optical remote
   sensing images are more sensitive to soil moisture near the surface
   layer; however, the accuracy of retrieving the soil moisture in deep
   layers was slightly lower in the study area. Second, in areas of
   vegetation coverage, MPDI and VAPDI had a higher inversion accuracy than
   PDI. To a certain extent, they overcame the influence of mixed pixels on
   the soil moisture spectral information. VAPDI modified by Perpendicular
   Vegetation Index (PVI) was not susceptible to vegetation saturation and,
   thus, had a higher inversion accuracy, which makes it performs better
   than MPDI's in vegetated areas. Third, the spatial heterogeneity of the
   soil moisture retrieved by the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI image were
   similar. However, the GF-1 WFV images were more sensitive to changes in
   the soil moisture, which reflected the actual soil moisture level
   covered by different vegetation. These results provide a practical
   reference for the dynamic monitoring of surface soil moisture, obtaining
   agricultural information and agricultural condition parameters in arid
   and semi-arid regions.},

Title = {Evaluation of Global Surface Water Temperature Data Sets for Use in
   Passive Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Inland open water bodies often pose a systematic error source in the
   passive remote sensing retrievals of soil moisture. Water temperature is
   a necessary variable used to compute water emissions that is required to
   be subtracted from satellite observation to yield actual emissions from
   the land portion, which in turn generates accurate soil moisture
   retrievals. Therefore, overestimation of soil moisture can often be
   corrected using concurrent water temperature data in the overall
   mitigation procedure. In recent years, several data sets of lake water
   temperature have become available, but their specifications and accuracy
   have rarely been investigated in the context of passive soil moisture
   remote sensing on a global scale. For this reason, three lake
   temperature products were evaluated against in-situ measurements from
   2007 to 2011. The data sets include the lake surface water temperature
   (LSWT) from Global Observatory of Lake Responses to Environmental Change
   (GloboLakes), the Copernicus Global Land Operations Cryosphere and Water
   (C-GLOPS), as well as the lake mix-layer temperature (LMLT) from the
   European Centers for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 Land
   Reanalysis. GloboLakes, C-GLOPS, and ERA5 Land have overall comparable
   performance with Pearson correlations (R) of 0.87, 0.92 and 0.88 in
   comparison with in-situ measurements. LSWT products exhibit negative
   median biases of -0.27 K (GloboLakes) and -0.31 K (C-GLOPS), whereas the
   median bias of LMLT is 1.56 K. When mapped from their respective native
   resolutions to a common 9 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) Grid 2.0
   projection, similar relative performance was observed. LMLT and LSWT
   data are closer in performance over the 9 km grid cells that exhibit a
   small range of lake cover fractions (0.05-0.5). Despite comparable
   relative performance, ERA5 Land shows great advantages in spatial
   coverage and temporal resolution. In summary, an integrated evaluation
   on data accuracy, long-term availability, global coverage, temporal
   resolution, and regular forward processing with modest data latency led
   us to conclude that LMLT from the ERA5 Land Reanalysis product
   represents the most optimal path for use in the development of a
   long-term soil moisture product.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a crucial role in understanding the hydrological
   cycle and the ecological environment. This research presents an improved
   change detection method that leverages time series data from Sentinel-1
   radar and Sentinel-2 optical sensors (2019-2021) to estimate surface
   soil moisture. The response of backscatter to soil moisture in bare soil
   was expressed in a logarithmic form, and the influence function of the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the backscatter
   difference was established for various vegetation-covered surfaces.
   Therefore, the impact of vegetation on backscatter is effectively
   mitigated, and the resulting change in backscatter relative to bare soil
   conditions can be obtained. An empirical function is subsequently
   formulated to ascertain the reference values of soil moisture in each
   pixel. The retrieval of soil moisture is demonstrated in the Wudaoliang
   permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and validated against
   ground measurements. The retrieval results of the improved change
   detection method exhibit correlation coefficients ranging from 0.672 to
   0.941, with root mean squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.031
   \$\{m<\^{}>3\}/\{m<\^{}>3\}\$m3/m3 to 0.073
   \$\{m<\^{}>3\}/\{m<\^{}>3\}\$m3/m3. Compared to the Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) 9-km product, our new method demonstrates higher
   correlation (0.898 vs. 0.867) and lower RMSE (0.037
   \$\{m<\^{}>3\}/\{m<\^{}>3\}\$m3/m3 vs. 0.044\$
   \{m<\^{}>3\}/\{m<\^{}>3\}\$m3/m3). The soil moisture retrieved from
   Sentinel shows a strong correlation with the SMAP 9-km soil moisture in
   the time series, thereby providing a better representation of the
   region's soil moisture heterogeneity. Our method demonstrates the
   feasibility of combining Sentinel-1 and 2 for high-resolution (100 m)
   soil moisture mapping in permafrost regions.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is the primary variable regulating the soil
   temperature (ST) differences between daytime and night-time, providing
   protection to crop rooting systems against sharp and sudden changes. It
   also has a number of practical applications in a range of disciplines.
   This study presents an approach to incorporating the effect of ST for
   the accurate estimation of SM using Earth Observation (EO) data from
   NASA's SMAP sensor, one of the most sophisticated satellites currently
   in orbit. Linear regression analysis was carried out between the
   SMAP-retrieved SM and ground-measured SM. Subsequently, SMAP-derived ST
   was incorporated with SMAP-derived SM in multiple regression analysis to
   improve the SM retrieval accuracy. The ability of the proposed method to
   estimate SM under different seasonal conditions for the year 2016 was
   evaluated using ground observations from the Wales Soil Moisture Network
   (WSMN), located in Wales, United Kingdom, as a reference. Results showed
   reduced retrieval accuracy of SM between the SMAP and ground
   measurements. The R-2 between the SMAP SM and ground-observed data from
   WSMN was found to be 0.247, 0.183, and 0.490 for annual, growing and
   non-growing seasons, respectively. The values of RMSE between SMAP SM
   and WSMN observed SM are reported as 0.080 m(3)m(-3), 0.078 m(3)m(-3)
   and 0.010 m(3)m(-3), with almost zero bias values for annual, growing
   and non-growing seasons, respectively. Implementation of the proposed
   scheme resulted in a noticeable improvement in SSM prediction in both
   R-2 (0.558, 0.440 and 0.613) and RMSE (0.045 m(3)m(-3), 0.041 m(3)m(-3)
   and 0.007 m(3)m(-3)), with almost zero bias values for annual, growing
   and non-growing seasons, respectively. The proposed algorithm retrieval
   accuracy was closely matched with the SMAP target accuracy 0.04
   m(3)m(-3). In overall, use of the new methodology was found to help
   reducing the SM difference between SMAP and ground-measured SM, using
   only satellite data. This can provide important assistance in improving
   cases where the SMAP product can be used in practical and research
   applications.},

Title = {Temporal Calibration of an Evaporation-Based Spatial Disaggregation
   Method of SMOS Soil Moisture Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The resolution of current satellite surface soil moisture (SM) estimates
   is very low, of tens of kilometers, which proves to be insufficient for
   various agricultural and hydrological applications. Amongst the existing
   downscaling approaches of remotely sensed SM, DISPATCH (DISaggregation
   based on a Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) improves the
   resolution of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture data
   using soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimates at high resolution
   (HR) and a SEE(SM) model implemented at low resolution (LR). Defined as
   the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation, SEE can be derived
   from the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI). The current version of DISPATCH uses
   a linear SEE(SM) model. This study aims at improving the SEE(SM) model
   and testing different calibration strategies, to ultimately have more
   robust and better downscaled SM products. A nonlinear SEE(SM) model is
   introduced and its influence on the derived HR SM products is studied
   over a range of conditions. Each model, linear and nonlinear, is
   calibrated from remote sensing data on a daily and a multi-date basis.
   The approaches were tested over two mixed dry and irrigated areas in
   Catalonia, Spain, and over one dry area in Morocco. When using the
   linear model, better statistical results were generally obtained using a
   daily calibration (current version of DISPATCH), most notably over one
   Spanish site. However, the best results were systematically obtained for
   an annually calibrated nonlinear model, in terms of all metrics
   considered: correlation coefficient, slope of the linear regression,
   bias, unbiased root mean square error. In particular, when using the
   annually calibrated nonlinear SEE (SM) model, the temporal slope of the
   linear regression between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture
   increased to 1.16 and 0.75 for one Spanish site and for the Moroccan
   site (as opposed to 0.44 and 0.58, respectively, when using the linear
   model with a daily calibration). The temporal correlation coefficient
   increased to 0.47 and 0.54 over the Spanish sites (as opposed to 0.18
   and 0.27, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily
   calibration). Those contrasted results indicate compensation effects
   between the model type and the calibration strategy. Taking into account
   studies that report the strong nonlinear behavior of the SEE with
   respect to SM, the introduction of the nonlinear SEE(SM) model in
   DISPATCH, combined with a multi-date calibration, is proven to perform
   significantly better under various conditions, leading to more robust
   disaggregated SM products. The SEE modeling based on the nonlinear SM
   model, with a multi-date calibration, could be integrated into the
   CATDS-Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS as a future product, as
   well as into existing evapotranspiration models, which are based on a
   combination of thermal and microwave data.},

Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},

Number = {1},
Abstract = {Aquifers of coarse gravel are an important source for drinking water;
   however, coarse sediments are also particularly susceptible to the rapid
   and long-range transport of pollutants through the vadose zone.
   Therefore, understanding the flow and solute transport in unsaturated
   gravel material is of utmost importance for the protection of drinking
   water resources. Experimental investigations of flow and transport
   processes are dependent on suitable sensor technology, but it is a
   considerable challenge to install soil moisture sensors in gravelly
   material. In this note, we developed a novel method to install soil
   moisture sensors with minimal disturbance in a large lysimeter with
   undisturbed gravelly sedimentary material, based on drilling access
   cavities in frozen material. We investigated whether it is possible to
   obtain reliable soil moisture measurements and found that the probes
   measured the flow dynamics pattern well but could not quantify realistic
   absolute water content values.},

Abstract = {Accurate and effective soil moisture prediction has gradually attracted
   attention due to the management of agricultural activities and the
   practical usage of water resources. Therefore, this research presents an
   integrated deep learning-based framework for soil moisture prediction,
   where long short-term memory (LSTM) layers, an attention mechanism, and
   fully connected layers are combined. In this framework, LSTM layers are
   applied to extract the complicated, long- and short-term dependencies
   from the time series soil moisture data. Besides, the attention
   mechanism is employed to learn the discriminative information from the
   extracted features. The genetic algorithm (GA), which aims to enhance
   the prediction accuracy, is applied to simultaneously determine the
   hyperparameters of the proposed network, called the GA-LSTM-ATT,
   consisting of the LSTM layer count, the hidden units in layers, the rate
   of dropout, and the learning rate. The experimental consequences have
   indicated that the GA-LSTM-ATT method outperforms the benchmark
   approaches in different evaluation indices.},

Title = {An advanced change detection method for time-series soil moisture
   retrieval from Sentinel-1},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {279},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {The feasibility of soil moisture retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1 data
   has been widely acknowledged, with preoperational 1-km products
   currently available at regional and/or continental scale using the
   long-term (LTCD) or short-term change detection (STCD) methods. Both
   algorithms share the same assumptions of time-invariant roughness and
   vegetation, which can be questionable even for a short period of 4
   Sentinel-1 acquisitions (18-36 days). An advanced change detection (ACD)
   method is proposed in this study for an improved soil moisture retrieval
   from Sentinel-1 data, including two main modifications with respect to
   the existing STCD methods: i) approximating the effect of temporal
   varying vegetation on the Sentinel-1 backscatter as a variation in the
   two-way attenuation, and ii) a temporal soil moisture constraint based
   on the coarse Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product
   to partly remove the uncertainty caused by vegetation and/or roughness
   changes. The evaluation, based on time-series observations from 34 OzNet
   stations and ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture
   Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) showed that the ACD improved
   the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and un
   biased RMSE (ubRMSE), achieving 0.66, 0.071 m3/m3 and 0.071 m3/m3 at the
   point scale, 0.77, 0.063 m3/m3 and 0.051 m3/m3 at 1-km scale, 0.80,
   0.055 m3/m3 and 0.050 m3/m3 at 3-km scale. The contribution of the two
   modifications was further investigated using 559 stations from 22
   networks across the world, showing that: i) the two modifications can
   increase R by 0.08-0.13 and reduce the retrieval RMSE by 0.009-0.013
   m3/m3 (10\% - 15\% relative), and ii) the retrieval over densely
   vegetated areas or areas with large temporal vegetation variation can
   benefit more from the proposed modifications. The ACD achieved stable
   performance for various Sentinel-1 orbits/passes and maintained a stable
   performance for retrieval windows up to 30 Sentinel-1 acquisitions,
   providing a promising alternative for achieving consistent soil moisture
   retrievals from Sentinel-1.},

Title = {An Improved Method for Water Body Removal in Spaceborne GNSS-R Soil
   Moisture Retrieval},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {61},
Abstract = {The global soil moisture (SM) retrievals by the spaceborne Global
   Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) are significantly
   influenced by the presence of water bodies. The traditional method is to
   build a grid based on the location of satellite sampling points and
   determine the presence or absence of water bodies. In this article, we
   propose a water body removal method for global spaceborne GNSS-R SM
   retrievals that combines water bodies and buffers derived from the
   marginal areas around water bodies as mask data, thus achieving accurate
   removal of the water body and avoiding margin effects. To verify the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) data
   with two different spatial resolutions (36 and 3 km) were used for SM
   retrieval, and the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) Radiometer SM
   as well as the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) were used as
   references. Results show that the correlation coefficient ( \$R\$ ) and
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the 36-km grid are 0.50 and 0.057
   cm3/cm3, respectively, while the \$R\$ and RMSE of the 3-km grid are
   0.68 and 0.041cm3/cm3, respectively. Such performances are better than
   the traditional method. Moreover, the method proposed in this article
   preserves more grids. Take the 3-km spatial resolution, for example, it
   preserves 2.2-fold grids more than the traditional water body removal
   method. In the comparison with SMAP SM, the overall improvement of RMSE
   by using the water body removal method proposed in this article is
   16.3\% (8.2\% for the traditional method). In the in situ validation,
   the overall improvement of RMSE is 19.4\% (-1.2\% for the traditional
   method). Therefore, in the future high spatial resolution SM retrieval,
   the water body removal method proposed in this article can preserve the
   maximum area and effectively eliminate the influence of water bodies on
   SM retrieval.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in the hydrological cycle,
   drought monitoring, and water resources management. However, passive
   microwave remote sensing products offer coarse spatial resolutions
   (approximately 25-40 km), greatly limiting their applications. In this
   study, we considered vegetation memory and increased the amount of
   vegetation data by spatiotemporal fusion, integrated lagged vegetation
   index and fusion data as model inputs, and downscaled the spatial
   resolution of SMAP SM using the Random Forest (RF) model as well as
   multi-source remote sensing data. The downscaled SM was validated with
   30 in situ SM measurements and daily precipitation data and explored the
   contributions of NDVI(lagged )and NDVIfused in downscaling. The results
   show that the downscaled SM is highly consistent with the in situ SM
   measurements. The correlation ranges from 0.628 to 0.849 with an average
   of 0.689. The root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 0.024 to 0.094

   the strengths of the RF model, fusion vegetation data, and lagged

Abstract = {Climate change has increased the frequency of extreme weather events

   Brazil, among these disasters, floods, flash floods, and landslides
   account for the highest number of deaths, the latter being the most

   Monitoring and Natural Disaster Alerts (Cemaden) has promoted the
   installation of a network of soil moisture sensors in regions with a
   long history of landslides. This network was used in the present paper
   as a base to develop a system for moisture forecasting in those critical
   zones. The time series of rainfall and moisture were used in an
   inversion algorithm to obtain the geotechnical parameters of the soil.
   Then the geotechnical model was used in a forward calculation with the
   rainfall prediction to obtain the soil moisture forecast. The landslide
   events of March 2020 and May 2022 in Guaruj ` a and Recife,
   respectively, were used as study cases for the developed system. The
   obtained results indicate that the proposed methodology has the
   potential to be used as an important tool in the decision-making process

Abstract = {Soil moisture controls the exchange of energy between the land surface
   and the atmosphere and is a significant factor affecting plant growth
   and productivity. Hyperspectral monitoring of soil water fraction could
   provide a theoretical basis for real-time estimation of spatial and
   temporal variations in soil moisture. To quantitatively evaluate the
   hyperspectral monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC): the SMC and its
   corresponding spectral reflectance were measured in the laboratory. In
   addition, the original spectral data was pre-processed by single and
   multiple transformations to study the effect of spectral preprocessing
   methods on the quantitative evaluation of soil moisture. The successive
   projections algorithm (SPA) was used to extract the corresponding
   wavelengths of soil moisture and the spectral monitoring model was
   established by using the partial least squares (PLS). The results show
   that (1) SMC and spectral reflectance show an obvious negative
   correlation, and the spectral reflectance gradually decreases with the
   increase of SMC. (2) Appropriate pretreatment methods can improve the
   correlation between SMC and spectral reflectance and improve the
   accuracy of the SMC monitoring model, of which T19 (R-2 + SNV + FD) is
   the best spectral pretreatment method. (3) The optimal SMC monitoring
   model is T19-SPA-PLS (R(2)v = 0.986, RMSEv = 1.824, RPD = 8.239). This
   study provided a reference for spectral data processing and an effective
   method for the accurate estimation of SMC using hyperspectral remote
   sensing.},

   probe sensor was vertical to soil surface and the probes inclined from
   the side view (FVSI). When the travel speed was not over 4.8 km/h, the
   dynamic measured and the static measured after the dynamic test by FVSI

Journal = {EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATICS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAR 22},
Abstract = {The paper aims to construct simple soil moisture(SM) retrieval model
   using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The water cloud
   model (WCM) removed the contribution of vegetation to the radar
   backscattering coefficient, and the backscattering coefficient of soil
   was estimated. Based on the established SM retrieval model without soil
   roughness parameters, the SM in farmland and forest land was retrieved
   using radar VV-VH dual-polarization data. We considered the interference
   of uneven surfaces on the radar signal, added the radar local incidence
   angle parameter to improve the model, and constructed a semi-empirical
   SM retrieval model. The accuracy of the results showed Root Mean Square
   Error (RMSE) of 0.04 and the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) of
   0.80. The SM retrieval model for removing soil roughness parameters can
   estimate soil moisture with reasonable accuracy. The influence of
   topographic factors (elevation, slope and aspect) on the retrieval
   results of the model was analyzed. It was found that the area with the
   steep slope and blocked radar signal is not conducive to estimate SM.
   The SM retrieval method constructed in this paper provides many
   advantages for some research and practical applications, and its
   application in other SAR data remains to be further studied.},

Title = {Release risk of soil phosphorus under different farming systems: Indoor
   experiments and in-situ measurement},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {240},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Agricultural phosphorus (P) application leads to the accumulation and
   release of soil P, which pose ecosystem risks. Different farming systems
   carry substantial risks of soil P release. This study evaluated the risk
   of soil P release in three representative systems of paddy fields in
   China (rice fields (RF), integrated crayfish-rice fields (CRF), and
   crayfish fields (CF)) using indoor adsorption and desorption experiments
   and the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) technique, and compared
   the obtained results. The soils of RF and CRF showed higher levels of
   redox potential (Eh), free Fe-Al oxides (DCB-Fe, DCB-Al), and amorphous
   Fe-Al oxides (Ox-Fe, Ox-Al) compared to CF. Additionally, the soils of
   CRF and CF exhibited higher total organic carbon (TOC) content. The
   indoor experiments revealed a positive correlation between the contents
   of Ox-Fe, Ox-Al, bioavailable P (BAP), clay, and soil P adsorption
   characteristics. Desorption characteristics were primarily influenced by
   total P, TOC, and Ox-Fe content. Furthermore, the order of soil P
   release risk followed CRF > RF > CF. According to the in situ DGT

   0.583 mg \& sdot; m(-2)\& sdot; d(-1) for CF. Accordingly, the risk of
   soil P release followed the order CRF < RF < CF. The contrasting results
   from these two methods are attributable to the indoor experiments
   indicating the potential for soil P adsorption under specific
   experimental conditions and the in situ DGT reflecting natural soil P
   release in a more effective and suitable manner for evaluating soil P
   release. The findings improve our understanding of the risk of soil P
   loss in CRF and provides valuable insights into the two methods.},

Title = {Assessing capacitance soil moisture sensor probes' ability to sense
   nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium using volumetric ion content},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN AGRONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {Accurate and near real-time volumetric soil water and volumetric ion
   content (VIC) measurements can both inform precise irrigation scheduling
   and aid in fertilizer management applications in cropping systems. To
   assist in the monitoring of these measurements, capacitance-based soil
   moisture probes are used in agricultural best management practice (BMP)
   programs. However, the ability of these sensors to detect nutrients in
   the soil sourced from fertilizers is not well understood. The objective
   of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of a capacitance-based
   soil moisture probe in detecting Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and
   Potassium (K) movement in the soil. To achieve this, a laboratory-based
   setup was established using pure sand soil cores. Raw soil moisture and
   VIC probe readings from the cores were contrasted across multiple N, P,
   and K rates. The N treatments applied were rates of 0, 112, 168, and 224
   kg/ha; for P, were 0, 3.76, and 37.6 kg/ha, and for K were 0, 1.02,
   1.53, and 2.04 kg/ha. Each nutrient was evaluated separately using a
   randomized complete block design experiment with three replications for
   N and K, and 5 replications for P. The impact of each nutrient rate on
   the sensitivity of VIC readings was determined by evaluating differences
   in three points of the time series, including the observed maximum
   point, inflection point, and convergence value as well as the time of
   occurrence of those points over a 24-hour period. These points were
   assessed at depths 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 cm. The findings of this
   study highlight the capacitance-based soil moisture probes'
   responsiveness to changes in all K rates at most depths. However, its
   sensitivity to changes in N and P rates is comparatively lower. The
   results obtained in this study can be used to develop fertilizer
   management protocols that utilize K movement as the baseline to
   indirectly assess N and P, while helping to inform those who currently
   use the probe which nutrients the probe may be detecting. The probes'
   readings could be incorporated into decision support systems for
   irrigation and nutrient management and improve control systems for
   precision water and nutrient management.},

   Ecology: Soil Moisture Mapping Using Signal Attenuation},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Wireless Underground Sensor Networks (WUSNs) that collect geospatial in
   situ sensor data are a backbone of internet-of-things (IoT) applications
   for agriculture and terrestrial ecology. In this paper, we first show
   how WUSNs can operate reliably under field conditions year-round and at
   the same time be used for determining and mapping soil conditions from
   the buried sensor nodes. We demonstrate the design and deployment of a
   23-node WUSN installed at an agricultural field site that covers an area
   with a 530 m radius. The WUSN has continuously operated since September
   2019, enabling real-time monitoring of soil volumetric water content
   (VWC), soil temperature (ST), and soil electrical conductivity.
   Secondly, we present data collected over a nine-month period across
   three seasons. We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm
   in predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal
   strength (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, above-ground pathloss,
   the distance between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air
   temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation as input
   parameters to the model. The AT, RH, and precipitation were obtained
   from a nearby weather station. We find that a model with RSSI, D, AT,
   ST, and RH as inputs was able to predict soil VWC with an R-2 of 0.82
   for test datasets, with a Root Mean Square Error of +/- 0.012
   (m(3)/m(3)). Hence, a combination of deep learning and other easily
   available soil and climatic parameters can be a viable candidate for
   replacing expensive soil VWC sensors in WUSNs.},

Abstract = {Tropical cyclones that originate from the Indian Ocean affect the Indian
   Sub-Continent. Heavy rainfall and flooding occur because of these
   cyclones. South Odisha was affected by Cyclonic Storm Daye in September
   2018 and Cyclonic Storm Titli was occurred in August affecting Andhra
   Pradesh and Odisha as well. The Eastern portion of India was affected by
   the Cyclonic Storm Fani in April 2019. In May 2020, West Bengal was
   affected by the Amphan which is a Super Cyclonic Storm and in the same
   year Tamil Nadu was affected by the very severe Cyclonic Storm Nivar in
   November 2020. These are just a few of the notable cyclonic events in
   the Indian Sub-Continent. These cyclonic events cause a dramatic change
   in a very short time from dry soil to exceptional flooding. In this
   proposed work, we are attempting to create an observations-driven
   prediction model to quantify the soil moisture variations daily, predict
   county-based meteorology and evaluate the cause of cyclones and heavy
   rainfall in certain areas of India. In our work, we applied a deep
   learning-based methodology to predict soil moisture. For the prediction
   model, we fused Feed Forward Neural Networks with the Gated Recurrent
   Unit (GRU) model and present the prediction results. We have used
   climatic as well as environmental data published by the Indian
   Meteorological Department (IMD) Warning from 2011. The collected data is
   time-series data. Comparisons and the relationship that exists between
   soil moisture and meteorological data are made and analyzed. The soil
   moisture of the South Indian states Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil
   Nadu are predicted from weather data using a hybrid deep learning model.
   The evaluations of the proposed work using Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
   Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared
   (R-2) against Non-hybrid Neural Network models such as Artificial Neural
   Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit
   (GRU) models is analyzes where our model has given better results.},

Abstract = {High-quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth
   system science applications, while the recent reanalysis and remote
   sensing soil moisture data are often available at coarse resolution and
   remote sensing data are only for the surface soil. Here, we present a 1
   km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine
   learning trained by the in situ measurements of 1789 stations over
   China, named SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China by in situ data, version
   1.0). Random forest is used as a robust machine learning approach to
   predict soil moisture using ERA5-Land time series, leaf area index, land
   cover type, topography and soil properties as predictors. SMCI1.0
   provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep
   at daily resolution over the period 2000-2020. Using in situ soil
   moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments were conducted to
   evaluate the estimation accuracy of SMCI1.0: year-to-year (ubRMSE ranges
   from 0.041 to 0.052 and R ranges from 0.883 to 0.919) and
   station-to-station experiments (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045 to 0.051 and R
   ranges from 0.866 to 0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other
   gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, and
   SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture are often located in
   the North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations
   of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the
   applicability of SMCI1.0 to study the spatial-temporal patterns. As
   SMCI1.0 is based on in situ data, it can be a useful complement to
   existing model-based and satellite-based soil moisture datasets for
   various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil volumetric water content (theta) is a parameter describing one of
   the most important factors conditioning proper plant growth. Monitoring
   soil moisture is of particular importance in the rational use of water
   resources for irrigation, especially during periods of water scarcity.
   This paper presents a method of measuring soil moisture in the vicinity
   of the plant root system by means of a probe designed to be mounted on a
   mobile device used for precise plant irrigation. Due to the specific
   field conditions of the measurement, the design of the probe was
   proposed as a monopole antenna. Electromagnetic simulations of the probe
   were carried out with Ansys HFSS software to optimise its dimensions.
   Then a prototype of the probe was manufactured to conduct laboratory
   measurements with the use of a vector network analyser (VNA) working in
   the 20 kHz to 8 GHz frequency range. The VNA analyser was configured to
   work in the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) mode. From measurements of
   the time distance between reflections from the probe's elements it is
   possible to calculate the bulk dielectric permittivity of the soil
   surrounding the probe. Next, based on commonly used soil moisture
   dielectric calibrations one can determine theta of the soil sample. The
   paper presents simulation results and laboratory tests of an antenna
   probe. Due to its tough and durable design, this type of probe gives the
   possibility of easy application in field conditions, which makes it
   especially suitable for mechanically demanding measurement systems. As
   the sensitivity zone is comparatively large, this probe is well-suited
   to measuring soil moisture in the vicinity of the plant root system.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor technology advancements have made soil moisture wireless
   sensor networks (SMWSNs) a vital component of precision agriculture.
   However, the humidity nodes in SMWSNs have a weak ability in information
   collection, storage, calculation, etc. Hence, it is essential to
   reasonably pursue task allocation for SMWSNs to improve the network
   benefits of SMWSNs. However, the task allocation of SMWSNs is an NP
   (Non-deterministic Polynomial)-hard issue, and its complexity becomes
   even higher when constraints such as limited computing capabilities and
   power are taken into consideration. In this paper, a novel differential
   evolution adaptive elite butterfly optimization algorithm (DEAEBOA) is
   proposed. DEAEBOA has significantly improved the task allocation
   efficiency of SMWSNs, effectively avoided plan stagnation, and greatly
   accelerated the convergence speed. In the meantime, a new adaptive
   operator was designed, which signally ameliorates the accuracy and
   performance of the algorithm. In addition, a new elite operator and
   differential evolution strategy are put forward to markedly enhance the
   global search ability, which can availably avoid local optimization.
   Simulation experiments were carried out by comparing DEAEBOA with the
   butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), particle swarm optimization
   (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and beluga whale optimization (BWO). The
   simulation results show that DEAEBOA significantly improved the task
   allocation efficiency, and compared with BOA, PSO, GA, and BWO the
   network benefit rate increased by 11.86\%, 5.46\%, 8.98\%, and 12.18\%

   in Chinese Coastal Delta Farmland with Sentinel-2 Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Soil water content is an important indicator used to maintain the
   ecological balance of farmland. The efficient spatial prediction of soil
   water content is crucial for ensuring crop growth and food production.
   To this end, 104 farmland soil samples were collected in the Yellow
   River Delta (YRD) in China, and the soil water content was determined
   using the drying method. A gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model
   based on a tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) hyperparametric
   optimization was developed, and then the soil water content was
   predicted and mapped based on the soil texture and vegetation index from
   Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. The results of statistical analysis
   showed that the soil water content had a high coefficient of variation
   (55.30\%), a non-normal distribution, and complex spatial variability.
   Compared with other models, the TPE-GBDT model had the highest
   prediction accuracy (RMSE = 6.02\% and R-2 = 0.71), and its mapping
   results showed that the areas with high soil water content were
   distributed on both sides of the river and near the estuary.
   Furthermore, the results of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis
   showed that the soil texture (PC2 and PC5), modified normalized
   difference vegetation index (MNDVI), and Sentinel-2 red edge position
   (S2REP) index provided important contributions to the spatial prediction
   of soil water content. We found that the hydraulic physical properties
   of soil texture and the vegetation characteristics (such as vegetation
   coverage, root action, and transpiration) are the key factors affecting
   the spatial migration and heterogeneity of the soil water content in the
   study area. The above results show that the TPE algorithm can quickly
   capture the hyperparameters that are most suitable for the GBDT model,
   so that the GBDT model can ensure prediction accuracy, reduce the loss
   function with less training data, and accurately learn of the nonlinear
   relationship between soil water content and environmental factors. This
   paper proposes a machine learning method for hyperparameter optimization
   that shows considerable potential to predict the spatial heterogeneity
   of soil water content, which can effectively support regional farmland
   soil and water conservation and high-quality agricultural development.},

Title = {Mapping High Spatiotemporal-Resolution Soil Moisture by Upscaling Sparse
   Ground-Based Observations Using a Bayesian Linear Regression Method for
   Comparison with Microwave Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture Products},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In recent decades, microwave remote sensing (RS) has been used to
   measure soil moisture (SM). Long-term and large-scale RS SM datasets
   derived from various microwave sensors have been used in environmental
   fields. Understanding the accuracies of RS SM products is essential for
   their proper applications. However, due to the mismatched spatial scale
   between the ground-based and RS observations, the truth at the pixel
   scale may not be accurately represented by ground-based observations,
   especially when the spatial density of in situ measurements is low.
   Because ground-based observations are often sparsely distributed,
   temporal upscaling was adopted to transform a few in situ measurements
   into SM values at a pixel scale of 1 km by introducing the temperature
   vegetation dryness index (TVDI) related to SM. The upscaled SM showed
   high consistency with in situ SM observations and could accurately
   capture rainfall events. The upscaled SM was considered as the reference
   data to evaluate RS SM products at different spatial scales. In regard
   to the validation results, in addition to the correlation coefficient
   (R) of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM being slightly lower
   than that of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM, SMAP had the best
   performance in terms of the root-mean-square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE
   and bias, followed by the CCI. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) products were in worse agreement with the upscaled SM and were
   inferior to the R value of the X-band SM of the Advanced Microwave
   Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). In conclusion, in the study area, the
   SMAP and CCI SM are more reliable, although both products were
   underestimated by 0.060 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.077 cm(3) cm(-3,)
   respectively. If the biases are corrected, then the improved SMAP with
   an RMSE of 0.043 cm(3) cm(-3) and the CCI with an RMSE of 0.039 cm(3)
   cm(-3) will hopefully reach the application requirement for an accuracy
   with an RMSE less than 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3).},

   A Multi-Depth Continuous Measurement from the Agricultural Pastoral

Abstract = {The agricultural pastoral ecotone (APE) in Northwest China is an
   ecological transition zone in the arid area with a very fragile
   ecosystem. In recent years, the ecosystem has deteriorated sharply, and
   increasing desertification has made the regional ecosystem more
   vulnerable and sensitive. In this study, we analyzed (using classical
   statistical methods) spatial and temporal variations in soil water
   content (SWC) from 14 September 2016 to 22 April 2019 for high and low
   vegetation in two grassland sites in Yanchi County, Ningxia. The results
   showed that the largest average seasonal SWC occurred in autumn. The SWC
   of the first three layers (0 divided by 15 cm) of the soil profile
   responded strongly to precipitation, whereas the SWC in deeper soil (30
   divided by 50 cm) could only be recharged markedly after continuous
   precipitation. Additionally, the growing process of plants proved to be
   a cause of variability in soil moisture profiles. Vegetation degradation
   sped up the course of desertification and decreased soil organic carbon
   content. These changes left the soil increasingly desiccated and
   enhanced soil variability. Meanwhile, vegetation degradation also
   prompted changes in soil temperature and shortened the soil's frozen
   time in winter. With the acceleration of global warming, if the process
   of vegetation degeneration continues and soil temperatures keep rising,
   the ecosystem is likely to undergo irreversible degradation.},

Abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the spatio-temporal variation in soil moisture
   provides insight into larger-scale hydrological processes and can,
   therefore, help in improving hydrological predictions. The strength of
   remote sensing for mapping surface soil moisture is well proven. In
   addition, data assimilation offers the opportunity to combine the
   advantages of modelling with those of remote sensing data to achieve
   higher accuracy and continuous improvement in hydrological forecasts. In
   this study, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation
   science soil moisture product was assimilated into Variable Infiltration
   Capacity (VIC) hydrological model using Kalman filter data assimilation
   technique. Further, the updated multilayer spatio-temporal soil moisture
   distributions across the Mahanadi Basin, India, were simulated using the
   hydrological model. The VIC model was set up and parameterized using
   field-observed and remote sensing-derived data. Based on the sensitivity
   analysis of the model, the `four-parameter' (Tmax, Tmin, Prec, and WS)
   meteorological forcing scenario was selected as the operational
   scenario. The output fluxes obtained from VIC were routed to simulate
   discharge at five stations for the calibration and validation of the
   model. With R-2 and model efficiency values close to 0.95 and 0.99,
   respectively, the model was proven to be suitable for simulating the
   hydrological responses of the basin. Soil moisture was assimilated in
   the top soil layer of the model using the Kalman filter approach, and
   the multilayer soil moisture regime was generated using the modelling
   approach. The validation of soil moisture (assimilated) products proves
   that these products are better than remote sensing and traditionally
   modelled soil moisture products, in both spatial and temporal domains in
   terms of availability and accuracy.},

Abstract = {The delineation of management zones (MZs) has been suggested as a
   solution to mitigate adverse impacts of soil variability on potato tuber
   yield. This study quantified the spatial patterns of variability in soil
   and crop properties to delineate MZs for site-specific soil fertility
   characterization of potato fields through proximal sensing of fields.
   Grid sampling strategy was adopted to collect soil and crop data from
   two potato fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI). DUALEM-2 sensor, Time
   Domain Reflectometry (TDR-300), GreenSeeker were used to collect soil
   ground conductivity parameter horizontal coplanar geometry (HCP), soil
   moisture content (theta), and normalized difference vegetative index
   (NDVI), respectively. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil pH, phosphorous
   (P), potash (K), iron (Fe), lime index (LI), and cation exchange
   capacity (CEC) were determined from soil samples collected from each
   grid. Stepwise regression shortlisted the major properties of soil and
   crop that explained 71 to 86\% of within-field variability. The cluster
   analysis grouped the soil and crop data into three zones, termed as
   excellent, medium, and poor at a 40\% similarity level. The coefficient
   of variation and the interpolated maps characterized least to moderate
   variability of soil fertility parameters, except for HCP and K that were
   highly variable. The results of multiple means comparison indicated that
   the tuber yield and HCP were significantly different in all MZs. The
   significant relationship between HCP and yield suggested that the ground
   conductivity data could be used to develop MZs for site-specific
   fertilization in potato fields similar to those used in this study.},

Abstract = {The difficulty of accurate and large-scale measurement for surface
   parameters limits the regional surface soil moisture (SSM) estimation
   using synthetic aperture radar (SAR). Moreover, the coarse resolution of
   soil moisture products generated by existing methods, which fuse SAR and
   passive microwave products, cannot fully satisfy the requirement of
   specific regional applications. To solve this problem, an SAR-optical
   data fusion method for soil moisture estimation (SOFSME) based on a
   cascade neural network is proposed in this study. SOFSME obtains surface
   parameters from historical soil moisture images and related
   environmental images to estimate a SSM image with high resolution at
   large scale from Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data. Validation experiments in
   single and multiple land-use type areas showed that the SOFSME performed
   best on bare soil areas with a median root mean square error of 0.0203.
   The median universal image quality index of estimated soil moisture
   image was 0.1454, which was better for single cropland areas than
   multi-land-use type areas. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a
   median value of 0.7645 in both experiments. These results showed that
   the SOFSME had high accuracy, availability, and stability in regional
   soil moisture estimation. Compared with existing methods, the SOFSME can
   provide high-quality soil moisture images and does not directly depend
   on field measurement data. Thus, the proposed SOFSME method is of great
   value for high-resolution soil moisture estimation in more regional
   applications. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation

Abstract = {The spatiotemporal variability of soil water content (SWC) at the remote
   sensing scale requires dense monitoring for calibration and validation.
   Here, we present an overview of the Texas Soil Observation Network
   (TxSON), an intensively monitored area in the semiarid rangelands of the
   central Texas Hill Country. TxSON is a dense network consisting of 40 in
   situ locations nested at 36, 9, and 3 km within the Equal-Area Scalable
   Earth Grid and serves as a Core Calibration and Validation Site for
   NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The 4-yr dataset consists
   of hourly SWC measured at 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm. The SWC data are
   upscaled using arithmetic, Voronoi, and inverse distance weighting for
   36-, (2) 9-, and (5) 3-km grid cells. We present the site selection,
   environmental characteristics, network design, quality assurance (QA),
   upscaling algorithms, and data structure. Ancillary data include bulk
   density, particle size, and carbon content for each site and depth. We
   also provide automated QA for each location and scripts to use our
   binary flagging in upscaling methods. To summarize, the 36-km grid cell
   has a mean bulk density of 1.34 +/- 0.18 g cm(-3) and a loam textural
   class. The in situ SWC has a root mean square error of 0.029 m(3) m(-3)
   against gravimetric data from 14 field campaigns. TxSON continues to add
   new locations with additional dense networks planned in other ecotones
   of the Edwards Plateau. The time series data along with scripts to
   import, plot, and upscaled SWC are available at https:// doi

   pH-values. Moreover, application-relevant pH values as well as

   selected according to the relevant measurement dynamics for the
   applications. For the development and testing procedures, a laboratory
   setup was built up. Supported by reference materials, the outputs of the
   ISFETs were evaluated with respect to stability under the influence of
   disturbance variables, reproducibility and settling time. The results
   were used to develop new readout electronics. Next to stability,
   conditioning and calibration processes were relevant. The micro-sensors
   were integrated in new application-specific mechatronic handling systems

Title = {Combining cosmic-ray neutron sensor and fallout 137Cs to explore the

   agroforestry hillslope},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {233},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {To ensure sustainable agricultural management, there is a need not only
   to quantify soil erosion rates but also to obtain information on the
   status of soil water content and soil loss under different soil types
   and land uses. A clear understanding of the temporal dynamics and the
   soil moisture spatial variability (SMSV) will help to control soil
   degradation by hydrological processes. This study represents the first
   attempt connecting cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) with soil erosion
   research, a novel approach to explore the complex relationships between
   soil water content (SWC) and soil redistribution processes using two of
   the most powerful nuclear techniques, CRNS and fallout 137Cs. Our
   preliminary results indicate that CRNS captured soil moisture dynamics
   along the study toposequence and demonstrated the sensitivity of neutron
   sensors to investigate the effect of parent material on soil water
   content. The Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the
   comprehensive data from seven CRNS surveys revealed that one dominant
   spatial structure (EOF1) explains 89.2\% of SMSV. The soil
   redistribution rates estimated with 137Cs at the nine locations along
   the hillslope, together with local factors related to soil properties
   (SOC, soil depth, hydraulic conductivity) and land use showed
   significant correlations with EOF. This study provides strong field
   evidence that soil type significantly affect SMSV, highlighting the key
   impact on soil erosion and sedimentation rates. Nevertheless, more
   research is needed to investigate the specific contributions of soil
   properties to the spatial variability of soil moisture and their
   subsequent effects on soil redistribution dynamics of interest for soil
   management.},

   anomaly information},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {626},

Abstract = {Water managers need improved seasonal streamflow forecasts in
   drought-prone regions like the U.S. Great Plains, where the inter-annual
   variability in rainfall and streamflow is high and seasonal streamflow
   forecasting systems are not well developed. Recent research has
   demonstrated that in-situ soil moisture measurements can be used to
   produce accurate streamflow forecasts in the Great Plains where rainfall
   runoff is the predominant source of streamflow. However, an inadequate
   density of in-situ soil moisture monitoring locations makes producing
   such forecasts impossible in many locations. Therefore, our objective
   was to develop and quantify the accuracy of seasonal streamflow
   forecasts for rainfall-dominated watersheds using remotely sensed data.
   Precipitation and remotely sensed soil moisture and terrestrial water
   storage anomaly data were incorporated into a multiple linear regression
   (MLR) model to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts for five watersheds
   in the Great Plains. The best MLR models had Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency
   (NSE) values ranging from 0.71 to 0.93, indicating good to very good
   model performance. In one watershed with nearby in-situ soil moisture
   data, the use of remotely sensed soil moisture data led to greater
   forecast accuracy than did the inclusion of the sparse in-situ data. Our
   results show that the use of remote sensing data in MLR models can
   provide accurate seasonal streamflow forecasts in rainfalldominated
   regions which currently lack such information.},

Abstract = {High-resolution spatial-temporal root zone soil moisture (RZSM)
   information collected at different scales is useful for a variety of
   agricultural, hydrologic, and climate applications. RZSM can be
   estimated using remote sensing, empirical equations, or process-based
   simulation models. Machine learning (ML) approaches for evaluating RZSM
   across numerous spatial-temporal scales are less generalizable than
   process-based models. However, data-driven ML approaches offer a unique
   opportunity to develop complex models of soil moisture without making
   assumptions about the processes governing soil water dynamics in a given
   study region. In this study, comparisons were made between two models,
   pySEBAL and EFSOIL, which were based on evaporation fraction (EF) and
   soil properties, and a data-driven model based on the Random Forest (RF)
   ensemble algorithm. These approaches were evaluated to demonstrate their
   capabilities for RZSM estimation. The EF obtained from Landsat images
   was used after validation with eddy covariance measurements as the major
   input to all three models, along with other meteorological and soil
   physical properties. The RF model was trained using in situ soil
   moisture data from Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors installed in
   a vineyard from 2018 to 2020. The predictor variables comprised of
   meteorological, soil properties, EF, and a vegetation index. The results
   reveal that there was a strong correlation between the in situ measured
   soil moisture and the RF predicted soil moisture at all sensor
   locations. Due to the complexity of the physical processes involved in
   soil water flow, the empirical models pySEBAL and EFSOIL were unable to
   reliably predict RZSM values at all monitored locations. The high RZSM
   predicted by pySEBAL demonstrated the presence of possible bias in the
   model's algorithm used to estimate soil moisture. We also demonstrated
   that ML based on the RF algorithm may be used to predict spatially
   distributed RZSM when a few soil moisture ground measurements are
   combined with remote sensing to produce soil moisture maps.},

Abstract = {Host plant resources are a major issue in gall-insect ecology. Soil
   fertilization may affect both plant quality and indirect defenses, as
   well as the prey quality of herbivores for predators. The soil fertility
   hypothesis (SFH) claims that gall-inducing insects infest more plants
   growing on poor than on fertile soils. Until now this was studied and
   supported only by observations in natural tropical biomes. We tested its
   validity in a field experiment in a Mediterranean region, using four
   aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Eriosomatinae) that induce galls in
   wild Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) trees, and their main
   enemies. The impact of fertilization was examined in control trees that
   were not fertilized ('poor soil') and others that were fertilized with
   NPK for either one or two consecutive growing seasons. Average internode
   length in apical shoots of fertilized trees was longer than in control
   trees, following SFH expectations. We did not detect a different number
   of aphid species in each tree, contrary to SFH predictions.
   Fertilization lowered the number of galls, the gall survival, and the
   mean number of aphids inside the galls, as expected by the SFH. All the
   galls suffered increased attacks by enemies in fertilized trees, as
   expected by the SFH. In conclusion, following this field experiment, the
   SFH should not be rejected as a possible framework in research on
   galling-insect ecology.},

   way in which vegetation types, fraction of vegetation coverage (FVC) and
   soil layer depth affect the SMC-estimation performance remains unclear.
   Therefore, the objectives in this study are to (1) evaluate the
   SMC-estimation performance provided by Landsat-8 data and random forest
   regression (RFR) algorithm; (2) discuss the accuracy of RS-based method
   for SMC estimation at different soil layer depths, and (3) explore how
   vegetation types and FVC affect the performance of SMC-estimation. The
   results can be summarized as: (1) the SMC estimation performance of
   multispectral (MS)- and thermal infrared (TIR)-based indices single used
   were comparable, in which TIR-based indices performed better in shallow
   soil layer while MS-based indices performed better in deep soil layer.
   Generally, MS- and TIR-based indices jointly used outperformed the index
   single used. (2) the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating SMC
   decreased with soil depth. (3) the proposed method performed greatest in
   grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types.
   Moreover, the SMC estimation in moderate vegetation coverage (FVC ranged
   from 0.3 to 0.5) was best. These results indicate that RS-based
   multimodal data combined with RFR could provide relatively repeatable
   and accurate SMC estimation. This approach can thus be used for the
   regional SMC monitoring and water resources management.},

Abstract = {An integrated soil-cotton management system integrated with optimal
   management practices is projected to replace the conventional management
   system for enhancing nitrogen use efficiency. Field experiment was
   conducted in the more and less fertile soil with two treatments. Results
   showed that compared with conventional management system, integrated
   soil-cotton management system increased 9.5-21.2\% soil-available
   nitrogen during the middle and later growth stages, in addition,
   improved average and maximum accumulation rate of nitrogen by
   30.4-36.2\% and 39.9-45.1\%, and postponed the start time of the fast
   nitrogen accumulation phase by 3-6d, resulting in 32.5-38.3\% higher
   final nitrogen accumulation. Furthermore, the increased nitrogen
   accumulation improved leaf area index, leaf area duration and boll
   number, finally enhanced agronomic nitrogen use efficiency and recovery
   nitrogen use efficiency. We suggest the nitrogen-based fertilizer of
   integrated soil-cotton management system could be omitted completely in
   the more fertile soil to enhance physiological nitrogen use efficiency
   ultimately by optimizing leaf area index. In addition, the decrement of
   nitrogen use efficiency was diminished under integrated soil-cotton
   management system. These results demonstrate ISMS might be a more
   profitable pattern for nitrogen use efficiency of cotton, especially to
   meet the challenge of soil degradation in future.},

Title = {A new variant of the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) for remote sensing
   of soil moisture and water bodies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Over the past few years, the Optical Trapezoid Model (OPTRAM) has been
   widely used as a means for highresolution mapping of surface soil
   moisture using optical satellite data. In this paper, we propose a new
   variant of OPTRAM that can map not only soil moisture, but also water
   bodies such as lakes and rivers. The proposed variant was tested using
   laboratory experimental data as well as Landsat-8 reflectance
   observations. Results showed the new OPTRAM variant has greater skill
   than the original variant in separating land and water pixels. In
   addition, the new variant showed less sensitivity to the model
   parameters, and hence, is less user dependent. To quantitatively examine
   the user-dependency of the model, we analyzed OPTRAM soil moisture based
   on Landsat-8 satellite images in California, where we varied the model
   parameters in a plausible range. The correlations of the resulting maps
   in terms of R2 between two largely different sets of parameters were
   found in the range of 0.47-0.52 for the original variant and 0.67-0.76
   for the new variant. Because some OPTRAM parameters can be quite
   uncertain, particularly in wet regions, the reduced sensitivity promises
   more consistent soil moisture estimates across the range of parameter
   choices.},

Abstract = {Efficient use of scarce water resources is both a marketing objective
   and an environmental obligation for sustainable agriculture. In modern
   agricultural production, which is intensive and should at the same time
   be environmentally friendly, there is a need to monitor soil moisture,
   salinity and temperature. The aim of the study was to determine the
   demand of producers of agricultural and horticultural plants for
   equipment and systems for monitoring soil properties at an individual
   farm level in regions with highly developed agriculture. A questionnaire
   survey was conducted among 1087 respondents, also direct interviews in
   Poland were undertaken. According to the producers' responses, it is
   important to know soil moisture, salinity and temperature, although
   currently only about 4\% of the surveyed farmers have the equipment to
   evaluate these soil parameters. In their view cost is not the most
   important obstacle to the purchase of the necessary probes. More
   important is that the devices should be easy to install and use, and
   have an easy to use application for data collection, processing and
   transfer. The current market does not offer solutions that meet these
   producers expectations. The demand for suitable probes is very high as
   over 80\% of the farmers declared their willingness to purchase such
   probes. Technical problems related to the operation and servicing of
   such equipment were the most frequently mentioned impediments in their
   use. However, farmers and horticulturists believe that knowledge of
   their soil properties would allow them to optimize the elements of
   cultivation technology, including the use of plant irrigation systems,
   the use of mineral fertilizers and plant protection products.},

Abstract = {Purpose Douglas-fir occupies a growing role in the European timber
   industries but its effects on soils and the environment are still not
   well understood. We monitored the biogeochemical cycle of major elements
   in 11 representative mature stands throughout France over the 2013 to
   2020 period to better understand repercussions on soil processes.
   Methods The present study is focused on throughfall and soil solution
   chemistry: concentrations were measured monthly at 15 cm and 60 cm depth
   and fluxes of major anions and cations were computed. Results Our
   results show that nitrate strongly dominated the soil solution
   chemistry: concentrations were elevated (>20 mg L-1) for 8 out of 11
   sites with mean annual NO3- values ranging from 2 to 253 mg L-1. Fluxes
   of nitrate at 60 cm of depth, ranging from 23 to 309 kg ha(-1) yr(-1),
   were much higher than those in throughfall for nine studied sites.
   Nitrate, which was the dominant anion in soil solution, associated
   either to Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, or to Al3+ was lost out of the soil-plant
   system through leaching. Conclusions These results suggest a production
   of NO3- in the soil exceeding tree uptake and microbial immobilization
   resulting in strong ongoing soil acidification at many sites and
   potential degradation of water quality. Significant negative
   correlations were found between nitrate concentration in soil solution
   and sandy texture, soil C and N, site elevation and, annual rainfall,
   but further research is necessary to clarify the role of these factors
   in reducing the negative impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},

   Trapezoid Space Using MODIS Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {The temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) has been commonly
   implemented to estimate regional soil moisture in arid and semi-arid
   regions. However, the parameterization of the dry edge in the TVDI model
   is performed with a constraint to define the maximum water stress
   conditions. Mismatch of the spatial scale between visible and thermal
   bands retrieved from remotely sensed data and terrain variations also
   affect the effectiveness of the TVDI. Therefore, this study proposed a
   new drought index named the condition vegetation drought index (CVDI) to
   monitor the temporal and spatial variations of soil moisture status by
   substituting the land surface temperature (LST) with the modified
   perpendicular drought index (MPDI). In situ soil moisture observations
   at crop and pasture sites in Victoria were used to validate the
   effectiveness of the CVDI. The results indicate that the dry and wet
   edges in the parameterization scheme of the CVDI formed a better-defined
   trapezoid shape than that of the TVDI. Compared with the MPDI and TVDI
   for soil moisture monitoring at crop sites, the CVDI exhibited a
   performance superior to the MPDI and TVDI in most days where the
   coefficients of determination (R-2) achieved can reach to 0.67 on
   DOY023, 137, 274 and 0.71 on DOY 322 and reproduced more accurate
   spatial and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Moreover, the CVDI
   showed higher correlation with the Australian Water Resource Assessment
   Landscape (AWRA-L) soil moisture product on temporal scales. The R-2 can
   reach to 0.69 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is also much better
   than that of the MPDI and TVDI. Overall, it can be concluded that the
   CVDI appears to be a feasible method and can be successfully used in
   regional soil moisture monitoring.},

Abstract = {The objective of the study was to associate soil moisture, aerial

   soil water content at the five depths, the aerial biometric
   characteristics, and the productive yield. In the roots, the genotypes
   RB044311, RB044313, RB044336, and RB867515 showed a higher yield. On
   average, genotypes showed 50\% of dry weight and total root length at a
   depth of 0-20 cm, 73\% between 0 and 40 cm, and 86\% between 0 and 60
   cm. The RB044336 genotype showed maximum height and number of buds. The
   RB867515 genotype had the largest average stem diameter and CTC9002, the
   largest number of tillers. The genotypes CTC9002 and RB867515 presented
   the highest soluble solids' content, apparent sucrose in the juice, and

Abstract = {There are a variety of metrics that are used to monitor drought
   conditions, including soil moisture and drought indices. This study
   examines the relationship between in situ soil moisture, NLDAS-2 soil
   moisture, and four drought indices: the standardized precipitation
   index, the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index, the crop
   moisture index, and the Palmer Z index. We evaluate how well drought
   indices and the modeled soil moisture represent the intensity,
   variability, and persistence of the observed soil moisture in the
   southern Great Plains. We also apply the drought indices to evaluate
   land-atmosphere interactions and compare the results with soil moisture.
   The results show that the SPI, SPEI, and Z index have higher
   correlations with 0-10-cm soil moisture, while the CMI is more strongly
   correlated with 0-100-cm soil moisture. All the drought indices tend to
   overestimate the area affected by moderate to extreme drought
   conditions. Significant drying trends from 2003 to 2017 are evident in
   SPEI, Z index, and CMI, and they agree with those in the observed soil
   moisture. The CMI captures the intra- and interannual variability of
   0-100-cm soil moisture better than the other drought indices. The
   persistence of CMI is longer than that of 0-10-cm soil moisture and
   shorter than that of 0-100-cm soil moisture. Model-derived soil moisture
   does not outperform the CMI in the 0-100-cm soil layer. The Z index and
   CMI are better drought indices to use as a proxy for soil moisture when
   examining land-atmosphere interactions while the SPI is not recommended.
   Soil type and climate affect the relationship between drought indices
   and observed soil moisture.},

   rock: A field test in weathered limestone},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Rock moisture in the vadose zone, while recognized as important, is
   rarely monitored-in part because adequate instrumentation and
   installation techniques are lacking. The objectives of this work were
   (a) to test the applicability of a commercially available capacitance
   soil moisture sensor (EC-5, METER Group) for continuously monitoring the
   water content of weathered limestone; and (b) to contrast the water
   dynamics of rock matrix with that of rock fractures. At a site in the
   Edwards Plateau, Texas, we developed a protocol for installing sensors
   in limestone pits and tested its effectiveness in reducing erroneous
   readings caused by installation-induced preferential flow along pit
   walls. Our results show that rock moisture can be accurately measured
   with EC-5 sensors, provided some steps are taken to ensure the quality
   of the installation. These include protecting the sensors by installing
   them in horizontal shafts rather than on the exposed pit wall, and use
   of a sealant. Data gathered over 7 mo after installation showed that
   rock moisture increased significantly only after a 95-mm rainfall event.
   Because of preferential flow, fractures reached peak water content
   within 2-3 h after peak rainfall-a response that was one to two orders
   of magnitude faster than in rock matrix. Limestone stored 40-70\% of the
   water after the 95-mm event, and its water content decreased
   significantly during summer months. Overall, our results attest to the
   importance of continuously measuring rock moisture in regions with
   shallow soils, where it serves as a critical reservoir for vegetation.},

Abstract = {European forests are suffering considerably from the consequences of the
   droughts of recent years, and the exact reasons and influencing factors
   for this are still not fully understood. This study was conducted to
   characterize the changes and dynamics of soil moisture in a mixed forest
   in northern Bavaria within 1 year. Since electrical resistivity
   correlates well with soil water content, we used two-dimensional
   electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) monitoring and time-lapse
   analyses to supplement punctual measurements by sensors and soil
   analyses to show soil moisture changes throughout a whole year
   (2020-2021). While the topsoil dries out significantly from summer to
   autumn down to a depth of about 3 m, a clear increase in soil water
   content and a decrease in resistivity below 3 m can be observed during
   winter period. Anomalies in the topsoil (0-1 m) showing lower
   resistivities than the surrounding substrate could be related to tree
   positions by additional terrestrial laser scans. A significant
   relationship could be found between tree crown projection area and
   resistivity in 1-2 m depth. We found a trend that mean resistivity below
   pine is lower as below beech. ERT data were also used to estimate the
   soil water content via Archie's law and the results correlate strongly
   with the measured values, but the degree of correlation varies depending
   on the depth level. ERT as a noninvasive method, in combination with
   additional data, for example, on the vitality status of individual
   trees, could help to better understand root water uptake and water
   supply to trees, especially during periods of drought.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture in root zone soil layers is one of the most important
   indicators of agricultural drought. Thus, monitoring agricultural
   drought requires not only knowledge of rainfall anomaly but also
   quantification of soil moisture. In this study, the effects of various
   methods of quantifying the green vegetation fraction green vegetation
   fraction (GVF) on the land-surface-model (LSM)-based soil moisture
   drought index (SMDI) were assessed using the harvest area data of the
   World Meteorological Organization together with the widely used
   vegetation health index and drought severity index. GVF data used in
   this study include monthly climatological GVF, weekly advanced very
   high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-normalized difference vegetation
   index-based and 8-daily moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI)-based GVF. The results show that SMDI is
   optimized when using the near-real-time GVF and that LAI-based GVF
   increases the accuracy of SMDI when monitoring early agricultural
   drought. The study shows that we can be confident in the accuracy of
   signals of emerging drought, particularly during the rapid onset of
   drought.},

Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) information can be routinely obtained from
   high-quality microwave retrievals at a global scale-such as datasets
   generated by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. In this
   article, using mutual information (MI) theory, we investigate the
   efficacy of the downscaled SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 3-km EASE-Grid SM product
   (SPL2) for the detection of agricultural drought over northwestern
   China. The SPL2 is generated by merging SMAP enhanced radiometer data
   with Sentinel-1 radar observations. To evaluate the efficiency of the
   SPL2 downscaled algorithm, the SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer 9-km
   EASE-Grid SM product (SPL3) is also utilized as a non-downscaled
   baseline. Over croplands, comparing normalized MI (NMI) values sampled
   between the NDVI time series and 3-km Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter
   coefficient (sigma) from SPL2 with NMI values between NDVI and SPL3
   radiometer brightness temperature (Tb; resampled to 3-km resolution), we
   find that the Sentinel-1 sigma explains more (3-km) NDVI information
   than the SPL3 Tb, as the NMI between sigma(vh) (sigma(vv)) and NDVI is
   15\% (8\%), larger than that between SPL3 Tb and NDVI (5\%). However,
   compared to the SPL3 Tb baseline, the information from downscaled SPL2
   Tb on NDVI is reduced by approximately 3\%, and the SPL2 algorithm
   extracts only 7\% (10\%) of the total information available from both
   enhanced SPL3 Tb and Sentinel-1 sigma(vh) (sigma(vv)). Overall, the
   C-band sigma signal provides valuable information for vegetation
   monitoring due to its frequency advantage. However, additional efforts
   should be focused on SPL2 merging algorithms to improve the value of the
   downscaled SPL2 product for agricultural applications.},

Title = {Monitoring of Extreme Agricultural Drought of the Past 20 Years in
   Southwest China Using GLDAS Soil Moisture},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Drought can cause severe agricultural economic losses and hinder social
   and economic development. To manage drought, the process of drought
   events needs to be described with the help of an effective drought
   indicator. As a comprehensive variable, soil moisture is an essential
   indicator for describing agricultural drought. In this work, the extreme
   drought events in southwest China were analysed by the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System (GLDAS) root zone soil moisture data set. To define
   the drought quantitatively, a Standardized Soil Moisture Drought Index
   (SSMI) was calculated using the soil moisture data, then used to get the
   duration, frequency, and severity of drought events in southwest China.
   The results showed that the frequency and intensity of drought in
   southwest China had an apparent upward trend before 2014 and an apparent
   downward trend since 2014. Moreover, there are apparent differences in
   the frequency and intensity of drought in various regions of southwest
   China. Yunnan Province is prone to spring drought events. Guangxi
   Province and Guizhou Province are prone to spring, autumn and winter
   droughts, and the intensity of autumn and winter droughts is
   significantly higher than that of spring droughts. The Sichuan-Chongqing
   border area is prone to summer drought. We found that the monthly
   variation of soil moisture in different provinces in southwest China is
   consistent, but the seasonal variation of drought is different.
   Meanwhile, the performance of the SSMI was compared to the commonly used
   drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index
   (SPEI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The results showed
   that the SSMI is more sensitive to drought than both SPEI and PDSI in
   southwest China. The results also demonstrate that GLDAS soil moisture
   data can be used to study drought at a small regional scale.},

Abstract = {In cities, green infrastructure has been used to mitigate flood risk,
   improve water quality, and harvest precipitation as a water source.
   Effective maintenance of green infrastructure requires optimal
   irrigation of plant root systems during the prolonged drying period.
   Based on the measurement of soil moisture, various drip irrigation
   systems have been developed. Surface irrigation, however, has the
   disadvantage of loss of soil moisture through evaporation. In addition,
   the growth of plants is mainly dependent on subsurface soil moisture,
   especially within the root zones. Therefore, there is a need to develop
   an automatic system regulating soil moisture at different depths. In
   this study, an Arduino-based irrigation control system was developed to
   regulate the volumetric water contents of soil within a certain depth
   range. A one-dimensional soil column test was conducted to demonstrate
   its performance. The test results show that the system enabled the
   regulation of soil water content within the specified range (12-20\%)
   with an error of 2\%. The error was further minimized by recalibrating
   the upper limit of the system. This study provides an improved green
   infrastructure irrigation system to control the moisture distribution
   within the soil subsurface.},

Abstract = {Remote sensing (RS) soil moisture (SM) products have been widely used in
   various environmental studies. Understanding the error structure of data
   is necessary to properly apply RS SM products in trend and variation
   analysis and data fusion. However, a spatially continuous assessment of
   RS SM datasets is impeded by the limited spatial distribution of
   ground-based observations. As an alternative, the RS apparent thermal
   inertia (ATI) data related to the SM are transformed into SM values to
   expand the validation space. To obtain error components, the ATI-based
   SM along with the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP) and
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM are applied with the
   triple-collocation (TC) method to evaluate the RS SM data regarding
   random errors and amplitude variances at the regional scale. When the
   ATI-based SM is regarded as the reference data, the amplitude biases of
   the other two datasets are determined. The mean bias is also estimated
   by calculating the mean value difference between the ATI-based and
   validated RS SM. The results show that the ATI-based SM is a reliable
   source of reference data that, when combined with the TC method, can
   correctly estimate the error structure of RS SM datasets in wide space,
   promoting the reasonable application and calibration of RS SM datasets.},

Abstract = {Effects of temperature and moisture on nitrogen (N) mineralization from
   organic amendments in high tunnel farming systems are rarely studied to
   assist N fertilizer management for high N-demand crops with short
   cycles. In this study, soils from a new high tunnel site were incubated
   at four temperatures (2, 10, 20, \& 30 degrees C) and five gravimetric
   water contents (15, 20, 25, 30, \& 35\%) with and without a dried and
   ground alfalfa amendment. Net N mineralization was determined by
   measuring NH4+-N and NO3--N contents periodically over 84 days.
   Significant main effects of temperature and moisture were found (p <
   .0001) and tendencies of a significance of alfalfa amendment (p = .0855)
   and interaction between amendment and temperature (p = .0842) were
   observed. Only a significant increase of the net mineralized N at 30oC
   in amended soil was observed compared to unamended soil (p = .0043).
   Estimated from the first-order exponential model, maximum potential
   mineralized N was 1.2 times greater while mineralization rate was up to
   2.1 times greater in amended soil compare to un-amended soil. Q(10)
   estimated from the Arrhenius model ranged from 1.62 to 2.04 in the
   amended soil and 1.66 to1.85 in the un-amended soil. The average optimal
   soil water content for maximum N mineralization estimated from the
   Gaussian function model was 33.8\% in amended soil and 35.9\% in
   un-amended soil. The results from this study can be used to suggest soil
   moisture and temperature management strategies to control N availability

Title = {A Forward Model and Inversion Algorithm for Near-Surface Soil Moisture
   Estimation With GNSS Refraction Pattern Technique},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) refraction pattern
   technique makes use of two pairs of GNSS receivers and antennas to
   collect the refracted signal in the medium and the direct signal in the
   air, respectively. Due to the sensitive response of the refracted signal
   to variation of the dielectric constant, the technique is suitable for
   measuring medium dielectric constant-related parameters such as snowpack
   density, vegetation water content, and soil moisture. In this article, a
   forward model related to the power ratio of the refracted signal to the
   direct one is developed to elucidate the mechanism of soil
   moisture-induced refracted signal strength attenuation. By making use of
   the simulating results derived from the model, a second-order polynomial
   function is established to describe the relationship between the power
   ratio, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Based on the function, an
   inversion algorithm, which takes the GNSS carrier-to-noise (C/N-0)
   observations under high elevation angles (50 degrees-60 degrees) and
   soil temperature as the inputs, is proposed for the near-surface soil
   moisture estimation. The proposed algorithm is validated through a
   dataset collected in an experimental campaign over two years. The
   results demonstrate that there exists a good agreement between the
   proposed method-derived soil moisture estimations and ground-truth ones;
   and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm-derived
   soil moisture estimation is 0.009 cm(3) cm(-3) when the ground-truth
   soil moisture is in the range from 0.150 to 0.550 cm(3) cm(-3). Because
   the observations were collected by using consumer-grade GNSS chips and
   antennas, this study also provides a basis for the design and
   development of the low-cost GNSS soil moisture sensor in the future.},

Journal = {ITALIAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) production in north western Ethiopia is severely
   constrained by the parasitic weed striga (Striga hermontica), the
   stemborer (Busseola fusca) pest, and poor soil fertility due to
   continuous mono cropping. An intercropping system known as push-pull
   technology is a novel soil and pest management strategy for improving
   soil fertility and controlling agricultural pests by using repellent
   ``push{''} plants (such as desmodium, Desmodium intortum) and trap
   ``pull{''} plants (such as napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum). The aims
   of the study were (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of the push-pull
   technology against stemborer and striga infestation, (ii) to investigate
   the impact of the push-pull technology on improving grain yield, and
   (iii) to assess effect of the pushpull technology on soil fertility. The
   study was conducted in 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons in 3 districts in
   north western Ethiopia. Three farmers from each district, who practiced
   the technology, were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a
   set of two treatments (plots): a push-pull technology (PPT) and maize
   monocrop (MC) treatments. Data were collected on the percentage of maize
   plants damaged by stemborers, the number of striga plants that emerged,
   plant height, grain yield, available phosphorus (P), available potassium
   (K), total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), organic matter (OM) and
   bulk density (BD). There were significant reduction in stemborer damage
   (2.8 \%) and striga count (4.1 Striga plants/m2) in the push-pull
   treatment compared to the maize monocrop plots (15.4 \% and 21.8 striga
   plants/m2, respectively). Maize plant height (2.34 m) and grain yield
   (5.3 t ha-1) were significantly higher in the push-pull plots as
   compared to the sole crop (1.9 m and 3.0 t ha-1, respectively).
   Similarly, there were significantly higher P (20.06 mg/kg soil), K
   (406.86 mg/kg soil), TN (2.5 g/kg soil), OC (42.9 g/kg soil), OM (73.8
   g/kg soil) levels considered to be moderate to high fertility status in
   the push-pull as compared to monocrop plots (11.17 mg/kg soil, 347.93
   mg/kg soil, 1.6 g/kg soil, 29.8 g/kg soil, and 51.2 g/kg soil,
   respectively) which is rated from low to moderate soil fertility level.
   Moreover, bulk density was significantly lower in PPT (0.92 g/cm3) than
   in MC (0.95 g/cm3) plots. This suggests that push pull technology is
   effective in reducing striga and stemborer damage and improves soil
   fertility status which results in better grain yield.},

Abstract = {For effective measurement and collection of soil moisture information an
   electronic system has been designed and developed. Since soil water
   holding capacity varies depending on the soil structure so a sensor
   probe is designed with a sensing system for efficient detection of
   moisture in the soil. The capacitive sensor probe is designed to detect
   a change of capacitance response from 15 to 1200pF. According to this
   change of capacitance response, a series RLC network is designed to find
   out an optimum frequency for efficient sensing of moisture. The designed
   sensor probe is calibrated for three different types of soil
   (silt/sandy/clay) using Thermogravimetric (TG) Analysis. To process the
   sensing data, DataLogger (DL) algorithm has been developed and
   programmed in an ARM controller for monitoring and storing of data on
   server using IoT (Internet of Things). For the designed sensing circuit,
   an optimum frequency of 218 kHz is found out from the resonance curve.
   At this frequency, the response of electronic interfacing circuit is
   observed in terms of capacitance and voltage. Data obtained from linear
   analysis (R square: similar to 0.99, Pearson's r: similar to 0.99) shows
   that the designed sensor system responds appreciably to the moisture
   change.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil moisture can be an important indicator of climate change in humid
   and semi-arid areas. This indicator can more efficiently propose
   different public policies related to climate change than just using
   precipitation and temperature data. Given the above, the objective of
   this study is to evaluate changes in soil moisture in the state of
   Pernambuco during the period 1961-2021, using the System of Hydrological
   Response Units for Pernambuco. In this study, two river basins in the
   state of Pernambuco that represent the different climatic conditions of
   the state were chosen. The results show that in the coastal region there
   is a tendency towards more saturated soils, and in the semi-arid region
   there is a tendency towards drier soils. With these results, it is
   possible to conclude that public policy decisions for the economy,
   environment, and society must consider this vital water balance
   variable. Leveraging soil moisture and precipitation data makes it
   possible to differentiate between flood risks and landslide
   vulnerabilities, particularly in regions characterized by higher levels
   of rainfall. Monitoring soil water content in humid and semi-arid areas
   can significantly enhance early warning systems, thereby preventing loss
   of life and minimizing the socio-economic impacts of such natural
   events. As such, this study provides a holistic understanding of the
   relationship between climatic patterns, soil moisture dynamics, and the
   occurrence of droughts and floods, ultimately contributing to more
   effective disaster preparedness and response measures in Pernambuco and
   similar regions.},

Abstract = {This work presents an improved gravimetric algorithm to derive reference
   soil moisture, with removal of some of the hypothesis on which its
   original expression was based, and addition of a new corrective term
   that takes into account the interdependence between temperature and
   non-unitary water density. The temperature correction term improves
   reference measurements by up to 0.55\% of their values in the
   temperature range 10-35celcius. The temperature-corrected reference
   measurements were applied to the calibration of a hand-held soil
   moisture meter (Lutron PMS-714) for three soil texture types: medium,
   fine, and very fine. Linear regression models were used to calibrate the
   meter for each soil type, and the resulting calibration equations were
   validated with field data sampled from Sondu-Miriu watershed in Western
   Kenya. The validation produced errors (RMSE = 0.022, 0.010, 0.010 m3/m3)
   that are significantly better than the meter's reported factory
   calibration errors of +/- 0.05 m3/m3. While calibrations did not improve
   correlation statistics (R2 and RMSE), they did significantly reduce
   biases (+ 0.009, + 0.004, -0.001 m3/m3) compared to uncalibrated ones
   (-0.216, -0.181, -0.184 m3/m3). Additionally, the calibrated meter
   values compared well with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) surface
   moisture data, with errors (RMSE = 0.010, 0.007, 0.008 m3/m3) well
   within SMAP recommended value of +/- 0.04 m3/m3. A spatial scalability
   test showed that the calibrations are adequately robust (with R2 = 0.81,
   RMSE = 0.016 m3/m3, and Bias = + 0.005 m3/m3), permitting calibration
   equations derived from one site to be scaled out to other sites of
   similar soil texture regime.},

Abstract = {Computational models are useful to estimate agricultural greenhouse gas
   emissions at regional scales. However, empirically based parameter
   values are required for the models to accurately represent carbon (C)
   and nitrogen (N) mineralization rates of different organic amendments in
   more and less humid regions or during wet and dry periods of the growing
   season. A controlled environment study was conducted to assess the rates
   of C and N mineralization in differently processed sewage sludge
   (biosolids) in wet and dry soil. Parameter values were estimated for use
   in modelling the degradation of three types of biosolids. A loam soil
   with either 49\% water-filled pore space (WFPS) or 29\% WFPS was amended
   with mesophilic anaerobically digested (digested), alkaline-stabilized,
   or composted biosolids. Headspace samples were collected and analysed
   for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and soil samples for
   nitrate (NO3-\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{NO\}\}\_3<\^{}>\{-\} \$\$)
   and ammonium (NH4+\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{NH\}\}\_4<\^{}>\{+\}
   \$\$). Four different first-order models were fitted to the cumulative
   CO2-C and N2O-N data (R-2 > 0.98), and soil NO3-\$\$
   \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{NO\}\}\_3<\^{}>\{-\} \$\$ (R-2 > 0.65) and
   NH4+\$\$ \{\textbackslash{}mathrm\{NH\}\}\_4<\^{}>\{+\} \$\$ (R-2 >
   0.93) concentrations. CO2-C data indicated that C mineralization was
   higher in soil with 49\% WFPS than in soils with 29\% WFPS. Seventy-nine
   percent of the C compounds in digested biosolids degraded in soil with
   49\% WFPS, compared with 52\% for alkaline-stabilized biosolids and 8\%
   for composted biosolids. The fitted coefficient values were similar for
   all of the four first-order models used in this study and provide useful
   information for parameterizing more sophisticated mechanistic models of
   the degradation of biosolids in soil.},

Title = {A stepwise method for downscaling SMAP soil moisture dataset in the
   CONUS during 2015-2019},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) product, which delivers
   spatially continuous soil moisture (SM) data with reliable accuracy, has
   been widely used in ecologically and hydrologically related studies.
   However, the active radar of SMAP failed after operation for approximate
   three months, leading to the loss of the original 3 km (called A3) and 9
   km (called AP9) SMAP SM dataset afterwards. Since merely the 36 km SMAP
   dataset (called P36 in this research) is available up to now, the
   relatively coarse spatial resolution is difficult to meet the
   requirement for monitoring at the regional scale. In this paper, the 36
   km SMAP SM dataset in the conterminous United States (CONUS) was
   downscaled to 3 km after the failure of the active radar. To reduce the
   great uncertainty in downscaling (i.e., a process from 36 km to 3 km
   directly), a stepwise strategy was proposed. Specifically, our currently
   published 9 km SMAP SM dataset (called VIP9, from April 2015 to December
   2019) was used as input for downscaling, which was downscaled to 3 km by
   fusion with auxiliary data (e.g., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) at fine spatial
   resolution based on areato-point regression kriging (ATPRK).
   Furthermore, a random forest (RF)-based correction process was developed
   to enhance the quality of the downscaled SM dataset by fusing with the
   ground-based SM data (i.e., in-situ data). As a result, a 16-day
   composited SM dataset at 3 km spatial resolution was produced from 2015
   to 2019, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) and unbiased root mean
   square error (ubRMSE) in temporal (spatial) validation of 0.888 (0.912)
   and 0.021 (0.023), respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that
   the AP9 dataset (although only available in the three months) is helpful
   to increase the accuracy of downscaling. Moreover, the difference
   between satellite- and ground-based SM data can be further reduced
   through the correction process. The produced 3 km SMAP SM dataset has
   great potential to extend the defunct A3 data and support related
   studies. The contributions of the paper are twofold, including the
   development of the stepwise method for downscaling and the generation of
   the 3 km SMAP SM dataset in the CONUS during 2015-2019.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an indispensable variable in drought monitoring
   and weather forecast. L-band is found to be the most suitable band for
   retrieving surface SM. Here, we evaluate two L-band passive microwave SM
   products Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in Inner Mongolia. The collected in-situ data from
   24 measured sites and the triple collocation (TC) analysis method (using
   Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah and the Advanced
   Scatterometer (ASCAT) SM data as a reference dataset) are used to
   evaluate SMAP and SMOS SM products. In the validation based on in-situ
   SM, SMAP shows the highest correlation with the in-situ SM, followed by
   GLDAS and SMOS. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias value of SMAP
   is the lowest. The validation results of each in-situ station show that
   the median correlation coefficient of ASCAT is the highest, followed by
   SMAP, GLDAS, and SMOS. The median RMSE and bias of SMAP are the lowest,
   while SMOS performs the worst among the three products. TC analysis
   results show that SMAP has better performance with the majority of the
   random errors distributed between 0.02 and 0.03 m(3)/m(3). The average
   random error of SMAP is small, while SMOS has relatively large random
   errors. Simultaneously, SMAP performs better than GLDAS and SMOS in
   grassland and low vegetation coverage areas. The research results and
   analysis of this paper are expected to provide some insights for
   improving the quality of SM products.},

Abstract = {The existing study aimed to assess four soil moisture sensors'
   capacitive (WH51 and SKU: SEN0193) and resistive (Yl69 and IC Station)
   abilities, which are affordable and medium-priced for their accuracy in
   six common soil types in the central region of Iraq. The readings'
   calibration for the soil moisture sensor devices continued through two
   gravimetric methods. The first depended on the protocols' database,
   while the second was the traditional calibration method. The second
   method recorded the lowest analysis error compared with the first. The
   moderate -cost sensor WH51 showed the lowest standard error (SE), MAD,
   and RMSE and the highest R2 in both methods. The performance accuracy of
   WH51 was close to readings shown by the manufacturing company (1\%), as
   the MAD amounted to 1.62\%. Through both methods, the average MAD for
   sensors ranged from 4.76\% to 7.36\%, with this result considered
   acceptable, especially for low-cost sensors with insufficient available
   information for accuracy. In general, the average mean absolute
   percentage (MAPE) for all sensors was 25.54\%, which means that the
   validity of the measurement for the low-cost sensors reached 75\%. It
   encourages their use by plant breeders in irrigation, as the error rate
   was less than the specified depletion of 50\% for available water in
   irrigation, where all study textures showed that the sensor reading
   reached the limits of 72 (+/- 2), adopting 3\% MAD for all sensors. The
   study affirms that, except for the IC station sensor recommended for
   irrigation use only in sandy -sandy loam soils, low-cost sensors have
   suitable accuracy for irrigation management.},

Title = {An observation-driven optimization method for continuous estimation of

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},

Volume = {11},
Number = {6},
Pages = {505-514},
Month = {JUN 2},
Abstract = {In most remote sensing-based soil moisture (SM) retrieval methods,
   in-situ SM measurements are commonly used for validation purposes. Few
   studies have investigated whether such measurements can be used for
   calibration. In this paper, an observation-driven optimization method
   was proposed to estimate SM from remote sensing observations.
   Specifically, the optimization method was developed within the surface
   temperature-vegetation index (TVX) framework for the definition of
   objective function and constraints. In-situ SM measurements were used to
   optimize the theoretical boundaries of the TVX feature space. We
   demonstrated the applicability of the new method with Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the Southern
   Great Plains (SGP) of the United States of America. Results indicate
   that the accuracy produced using only one site for calibration has
   reached a level comparable with those produced by traditional methods.
   Moreover, the method has not only bypassed the complex parameterization
   of aerodynamic and surface resistance but also achieved continuous
   monitoring of SM. That is just the capacity that the traditional TVX
   method does not possess. Therefore, although our optimization method
   requires the ancillary of in-situ observations, its simplicity proves
   that it is a useful tool for a quick and continuous monitoring of SM
   over large heterogeneous areas.},

Abstract = {Accurate monitoring of soil moisture is crucial in hydrological and
   ecological studies. Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) measure
   area-average soil moisture at field scale, filling a spatial scale gap
   betweenin-situobservations and remote sensing measurements. However, its
   applicability has not been assessed in the agricultural-pastoral
   ecotone, a data scarce semi-arid and arid region in Northwest China
   (APENC). In this study, we calibrated and assessed the CRNS (the
   standardN(0)method) estimates of soil moisture. Results show that
   Pearson correlation coefficient,R-P, and the root mean square error
   (RMSE) between the CRNS soil moisture and the gravimetric soil moisture
   are 0.904 and less than 0.016 m(3)m(-3), respectively, indicating that
   the CRNS is able to estimate the area-average soil moisture well at our
   study site. Compared with thein-situsensor network measurements (ECH2O
   sensors), the CRNS is more sensitive to the changes in moisture in its
   footprint, which overestimates and underestimates the soil moisture
   under precipitation and dry conditions, respectively. The three shape
   parametersa(0),a(1),a(2)in the standard calibration equation
   (N(0)method) are not well suited to the study area. The calibrated
   parameters improved the accuracy of the CRNS soil moisture estimates.
   Due to the lack of low gravimetric soil moisture data, performance of
   the calibratedN(0)function is still poor in the extremely dry
   conditions. Moreover, aboveground biomass including vegetation biomass,
   canopy interception and widely developed biological soil crusts adds to
   the uncertainty of the CRNS soil moisture estimates. Such biomass
   impacts need to be taken into consideration to further improve the
   accuracy of soil moisture estimation by the CRNS in the data scarce
   areas such as agricultural-pastoral ecotone in Northwest China.},

Abstract = {As a key component in the water and energy cycle, estimates of
   precipitation with high resolution and accuracy is of great significance
   for hydrological, meteorological, and ecological studies. However,
   current satellite-based precipitation products have a coarse spatial
   resolution (from 10 to 50 km) not meeting the needs of several
   applications (e.g., flash floods and landslides). The implementation of
   spatial downscaling methods can be a suitable approach to overcome this
   shortcoming. In this study, we developed a soil moisture-based
   precipitation downscaling (SMPD) method for spatially downscaling the
   integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation
   measurement (IMERG) V06B daily precipitation product over a complex
   topographic and climatic area in southwestern Europe (Iberian Peninsula)
   in the period 2016-2018. By exploiting the soil-water balance equation,
   high-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) and normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) products were used as auxiliary variables. The
   spatial resolution of the IMERG daily precipitation product was
   downscaled from 10 to 1 km. An evaluation using 1027 rain gauge stations
   highlighted the good performance of the downscaled 1 km IMERG product
   compared to the original 10 km product, with a correlation coefficient
   of 0.61, root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.83 mm and a relative bias of
   5 \%. Meanwhile, the 1 km downscaled results can also capture the
   typical temporal and spatial variation behaviors of precipitation in the
   study area during dry and wet seasons. Overall, the SMPD method greatly
   improves the spatial details of the original 10 km IMERG product also
   with a slight enhancement of accuracy. It shows good potential to be
   applied for the development of high-quality and high-resolution
   precipitation products in any region of interest.},

Title = {Downscaling SMAP soil moisture using a wide \& deep learning method over
   the Continental United States},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {609},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in drought monitoring,
   agricultural management, flood forecasting, and other practical
   applications. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of SM
   products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals
   (approximately 25-55 km) greatly hamper their local-scale applications.
   In this research, we proposed an SM downscaling framework based on the
   Wide \& Deep Learning (WDL) method to improve the spatial resolution of
   the level-3 daily composite of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
   radiometer SM product (L3\_SM\_P). In this method, horizontally and
   vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh, and TBv,
   respectively), surface reflectance and Land Surface Temperature (LST),
   topographic attributes, soil properties, climate types, and landcover
   types collected in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the
   annual unfrozen season (April 1st to November 1st) from 2015 to 2017
   were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of
   the SMAP SM (L3\_SM\_P) product from its original 36 km to 1 km.
   Precipitation and in-situ SM measurements obtained from 211 sites
   distributed across the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over
   the CONUS were utilized to validate the downscaled SM. The results
   demonstrated that the correlation (R) between the downscaled and the
   in-situ SM ranged from 0.325 to 0.997; the average R value was 0.715.
   The unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) values ranged from 0.010 to
   0.141 m3/m3, with an average ubRMSE of 0.041 m3/m3, which meets the
   accuracy of SMAP SM requirement of ubRMSE approximately 0.04 m 3/m3. The
   downscaled SM also showed good temporal consistency with the in-situ SM
   and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data. The downscaled
   SM not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original SMAP
   SM but also provides more detailed spatial SM variations.},

Abstract = {Based on the gravimetric-technique-measured soil relative wetness and
   the observed soil characteristic parameters from 1992 to 2013 in China,
   this study derives a user-convenient monthly volumetric soil moisture
   (SM) dataset from 732 stations for five soil layers (10, 20, 50, 70, and
   100 cm). The temporal-spatial variations in SM and its relationship with
   precipitation (Pr) in different subregions are then explored. The
   magnitude of SM is relatively large in south China and is low in
   northwest China, and it generally increases with soil depth in each
   region. The maximum SM appears in spring and/or autumn and the minimum
   in summer, and the SM seasonality does not vary as distinctly as that of
   Pr. For the top three soil layers (10-, 20-, and 50-cm levels), the
   linear trend analysis indicates an overall increasing SM tendency, and
   the mean trends (averaged across stations with trends passing a 95\%
   significance level test) are 9.35 x 10(-7), 7.37 x 10(-3), and 2.45 x
   10(-3) cm(3) cm(-3) yr(-1), respectively. SM memory depends on the soil
   depth and regions, and it has longer retention time in the deeper
   layers. Furthermore, the correlation between SM and antecedent Pr varies
   with soil depth and lag time. The antecedent Pr anomaly (1 or 2 months
   in advance) can be used to some extent as a surrogate SM anomaly in most
   regions except for in arid regions. This result is further demonstrated
   by the relationships between the SM anomaly and the standardized
   precipitation index. The current SM dataset can be used in various
   applications, such as validating satellite-retrieved products and model
   outputs.},

Abstract = {A low power wireless sensor network based on LoRaWAN protocol was
   designed with a focus on the IoT low-cost Precision Agriculture
   applications, such as greenhouse sensing and actuation. All subsystems
   used in this research are designed by using commercial components and
   free or open-source software libraries. The whole system was implemented
   to demonstrate the feasibility of a modular system built with cheap
   off-the-shelf components, including sensors. The experimental outputs
   were collected and stored in a database managed by a virtual machine
   running in a cloud service. The collected data can be visualized in real
   time by the user with a graphical interface. The reliability of the
   whole system was proven during a continued experiment with two natural
   soils, Loamy Sand and Silty Loam. Regarding soil parameters, the system
   performance has been compared with that of a reference sensor from
   Sentek. Measurements highlighted a good agreement for the temperature
   within the supposed accuracy of the adopted sensors and a non-constant
   sensitivity for the low-cost volumetric water contents (VWC) sensor.
   Finally, for the low-cost VWC sensor we implemented a novel procedure to
   optimize the parameters of the non-linear fitting equation correlating
   its analog voltage output with the reference VWC.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABLE COMPUTING-INFORMATICS \& SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {28},

Abstract = {Maintenance of green infrastructure requires persistent monitoring of
   soil water content, electrical conductivity (EC), temperature and
   relative humidity (RH). There is need to create relation among these
   parameters to deduce soil water content as to limit cost of introducing
   sensors. The present investigation means to measure the progression of
   these four parameters in a green infrastructure site in an urban
   landscape and to additionally create correlations among them. An
   incorporated field testing and statistical modeling approach is embraced
   to accomplish the objective. Four sites including bare, grassed and
   treed soil are chosen for examination. Field monitoring was first
   directed to monitor the above mentioned four parameters for two months.
   This is trailed by statistical modeling using artificial intelligence
   (AI) approach (i.e., artificial neutral networks (ANN)). Correlations
   are created for evaluating soil water content as function of EC, RH and
   temperature for the four sites. Regardless of the sort of cover, EC is
   strongly correlated to soil water content, followed by RH and soil
   temperature. The correlation of EC is strongest in vegetated soil when
   compared with bare soil. The relationship of soil temperature with water
   content of soil do not have a decisive pattern. Ensuring drying of soils
   does not increase temperature fundamentally after precipitation.
   Uncertainty investigation additionally presumes that water content of
   soil follows normal distribution function in treed soils, while it
   follows skewed distribution in the cases of grassed and bare soils. (C)

   Maximizing Network Efficiency in Soil Moisture Wireless Sensor Networks},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSORS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {In agriculture, soil moisture wireless sensor networks (SMWSNs) are used
   to monitor the growth of crops for obtaining higher yields. The purpose
   of this paper is to improve the network efficiency of SMWSNs. Therefore,
   we propose a novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism which is
   suitable for soil moisture sensors and design a sensor target allocation
   model (STAM) for the actual agricultural situation. After that, a
   quantum clone elite genetic algorithm (QCEGA) is proposed; then, QCEGA
   is applied to optimize the STAM for obtaining optimal results. QCEGA
   uses the parallel mechanism of quantum computing to encode individuals,
   integrates the quantum revolving gate in quantum computing and the
   concept of cloning in biology to avoid the algorithm from falling into
   local optimum, and applies the elite strategy to speed up the
   convergence of the algorithm. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is
   compared with simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization
   (PSO). Under the novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism, the
   simulation results demonstrate that the network efficiency based on
   QCEGA is higher than that of SA and PSO; what is more, QCEGA has better
   convergence performance. In comparison with traditional wireless sensor
   network efficiency evaluation approaches, our methods are more in line
   with the development of modern agriculture and can effectively improve
   the efficiency of SMWSNs, thus ensuring that crops can have a better

Abstract = {Large-scale vegetation restoration campaigns have been implemented on
   the Chinese Loess Plateau, which have resulted in higher soil moisture
   deficits in this region. This, in turn, has hampered the healthy growth
   of planted trees, leading to a decline and, in severe cases, mortality
   of trees. Therefore, the rational regulation and utilization of
   rainwater, the primary water source in this region, may alleviate
   drought stress, ensuring the sustainability of the ecosystem. In this
   study, we investigated the impact of in situ rainwater collection and
   infiltration systems (IRCISs) on soil water, fine-root distribution,
   xylem vascular, and hydraulic conductivity characteristics in declining
   Robinia pseudoacacia forests. The results demonstrated that the
   application of an IRCIS can effectively increase plant available
   moisture content (0-5.0 m) of declining Robinia pseudoacacia forests. In
   particular, IRCIS treatment significantly increased xylem conduit
   diameter and plant hydraulic conductivity while substantially reducing
   the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity in both roots and
   branches. Furthermore, IRCIS treatment significantly reduced the root
   biomass and distribution depth of Robinia pseudoacacia during both wet
   and dry years. This implies that IRCISs are beneficial for plant growth
   and survival. The findings of this study are significant for devising
   strategic methodologies for the planning and management of rainwater

Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {The combination of wireless sensor networks and radio technology can
   form a new type of communication network. The emergence of wireless
   sensor networks has effectively solved the problems existing in radio
   technology, but traditional wireless sensor networks and radio
   technology networks cannot be directly applied to wireless sensors. On
   this basis, this paper studies the remote sensing of soil nutrient
   variability in agricultural land using wireless sensors. Due to
   traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil
   nutrient variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess
   nutrients, reducing the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting
   high-quality farmland. Traditional farming methods can no longer meet
   the requirements, and modern technology must be used to comprehensively
   understand the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients during plant
   growth. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, speed,
   economy, and regular monitoring. It provides new ideas and technical
   guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land development and
   consolidation projects. This paper also studies the use of statistical
   quantitative evaluation technology to carry out multidimensional
   statistical quantification of soil protection function evaluation at a
   given location. Finally, wireless sensor networks are used to analyze
   the relationship between several natural factors and quantitative
   estimation of soil protection. Based on wireless sensor technology, this
   paper studies the variability of farmland soil nutrients and statistical
   quantitative evaluation, hoping to lay a foundation for the development
   of agriculture and statistics.},

Abstract = {The cosmic-ray neutron technology is a novel method for upscaling soil
   moisture, holding significant importance in drought monitoring, soil
   water storage estimation, calibration of remote sensing products, and
   data assimilation of land surface models. However, most studies
   conducted soil moisture measurement experiments using static Cosmic-Ray
   Neutron Sensors (CRNS) and are often limited to a single landscape,
   lacking in-situ measurement for the cosmic-ray neutron rover across
   various landscapes. This study carried out soil moisture observation
   experiments using a cosmic-ray neutron rover in nine grassland plots,
   nine farmland plots, and nine desert plots of the Heihe River Basin,
   Northwest China. The neutron counts displayed clear variations among
   different plots, and an equation could represent the relationship
   between neutron intensity and multiple variables near the ground. The
   parameter N-0 was the smallest for grassland and greatest for desert,
   and there was a significant negative correlation between Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index and N-0 (P <0.05). Furthermore, the
   performance of CRNS notably improved after considering soil lattice
   water and soil organic matter. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between
   the measured and oven-dried soil moisture increased with radius. Soil
   moisture measured by CRNS strongly supported the 100 m diameter
   footprint assumption (RMSE <0.044 g/g). The study offers valuable
   insights into the application and promotion of cosmic-ray neutron
   technology across various landscapes within a basin.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the effect of the soil moisture evaporation rate
   on the soil water retention curve (SWRC) of clays obtained using the
   high-capacity tensiometer (HCT) technique and following the continuous
   drying (dynamic) method. SWRC measurements, with and without soil
   moisture evaporation rate control, were carried out on reconstituted
   London clay specimens using 12 performance-improved HCTs recently
   developed at the University of Warwick. Furthermore, the HCTs'
   performance in terms of the maximum attainable suction (s(max)) and
   maximum measurement duration (t(max)) was evaluated. Moreover, the
   suitability of a curve-fitting-based model, available in the literature,
   for attaining the entire retention curve (beyond the capacity of HCTs)
   was evaluated. The SWRCs for the tests with a controlled evaporation
   rate were found to generally exhibit higher suction at a given water
   content, hence inducing air-entry values that were on average 16\%
   higher than those obtained from tests without evaporation rate control.
   It was also found that for suction in excess of 2 MPa, the
   curve-fitting-based model predictions of data obtained from tests with a
   controlled evaporation rate exhibited significantly lower suction at a
   given water content than those without evaporation rate control,
   suggesting that such curve fitting correlations should be used with
   caution.},

Abstract = {Spaceborne GNSS-R technology is a new remote sensing method for soil
   moisture monitoring. Focusing on the significant influence of water on
   the surface reflectivity of CYGNSS, this paper improved the removal
   method of water influence according to the spatial resolution of CYGNSS
   data. Due to the disturbance effect of the incident angle, microwave
   frequency and soil type on the Fresnel reflection coefficient in surface
   reflectivity, a normalization method of Fresnel reflection coefficient
   was proposed after analyzing the data characteristics of variables in
   the Fresnel reflection coefficient. Finally, combined with the soil
   moisture retrieval method of linear equation, the accuracy was compared
   and verified by using measured data, SMAP products and official CYGNSS
   products. The results indicate that the normalization method of the
   Fresnel reflection coefficient could effectively reduce the influence of
   relevant parameters on the Fresnel reflection coefficient, but the
   normalization effect became worse at large incident angles (greater than
   65 \& DEG;). Compared with the official CYGNSS product, the retrieval
   accuracy of optimized soil moisture was improved by 10\%. The method
   proposed in this paper will play an important reference role in the

Abstract = {Citizen science, scientific work and data collection conducted by or
   with non-experts, is rapidly growing. Although the potential of citizen
   science activities to generate enormous amounts of data otherwise not
   feasible is widely recognized, the obtained data are often treated with
   caution and scepticism. Their quality and reliability is not fully
   trusted since they are obtained by non-experts using low-cost
   instruments or scientifically non-verified methods. In this study, we
   evaluate the performance of Parrot's Flower Power soil moisture sensor
   used within the European citizen science project the GROW Observatory
   (GROW; https://growobservatory.org, last access: 30 March 2020). The aim
   of GROW is to enable scientists to validate satellite-based soil
   moisture products at an unprecedented high spatial resolution through
   crowdsourced data. To this end, it has mobilized thousands of citizens
   across Europe in science and climate actions, including hundreds who
   have been empowered to monitor soil moisture and other environmental
   variables within 24 high-density clusters around Europe covering
   different climate and soil conditions. Clearly, to serve as reference
   dataset, the quality of ground observations is crucial, especially if
   obtained from low-cost sensors. To investigate the accuracy of such
   measurements, the Flower Power sensors were evaluated in the lab and
   field. For the field trials, they were installed alongside professional
   soil moisture probes in the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) in
   Petzenkirchen, Austria. We assessed the skill of the low-cost sensors
   against the professional probes using various methods. Apart from common
   statistical metrics like correlation, bias, and root-mean-square
   difference, we investigated and compared the temporal stability, soil
   moisture memory, and the flagging statistics based on the International
   Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) quality indicators. We found a low
   intersensor variation in the lab and a high temporal agreement with the
   professional sensors in the field. The results of soil moisture memory
   and the ISMN quality flags analysis are in a comparable range for the
   low-cost and professional probes; only the temporal stability analysis
   shows a contrasting outcome. We demonstrate that low-cost sensors can be
   used to generate a dataset valuable for environmental monitoring and
   satellite validation and thus provide the basis for citizen-based soil
   moisture science.},

   differences and spatial heterogeneity regarding the sensitivity of soil
   nutrient systems to LUI and climate change. Among them, soil nutrients
   were the most sensitive to temperature changes, followed by LUI, while
   precipitation was the weakest. Soil nutrient sensitivity showed a
   decreasing spatial distribution pattern from the northeast to the
   southwest. The soil nutrient system had a strong adaptability to LUI and
   climate change. However, there were differences in different sensitivity
   states. These results provide scientific guidance for the spatial

Abstract = {In the water content measurement technology based on actively heated

   using the actively heated fiber-optic fiber Bragg grating (AHFO-FBG)

   content calculation; in the in-situ water content measurement, if the
   dry density of the soil is small (<= 1.5 g/cm(3)), the modified Cote and

Abstract = {The question if biochar is a suitable soil nutrient amendment for potato
   cultivation in the Atlantic Canada is yet to be answered. The objective
   of this study was to answer this question. Three replicates of twelve
   lysimeters, each 8000 cm(2), were packed with an Atlantic Canada
   representative soil to cultivate potatoes with four treatments of soil
   amendments (T-1 = control {[}no added nutrients], T-2 = B {[}biochar],
   T-3 = F {[}synthetic fertilizer @ recommended NPK], and T-4 = B + F
   {[}biochar + recommended NPK]) under a completely randomized block
   design with factorial arrangements. Chemical analyses of soils were
   conducted for physical, hydrological, and chemical (including
   concentration of macro- and micro-nutrients) prior to and after the
   completion experiments to evaluate soil fertility and its resulting
   effects on crop yield. The biochar amendment improved soil micro- and
   macro-nutrients. Soil organic matter, pH, and cation exchange capacity
   (ECE) significantly increased by application of biochar. The maximum
   potato yield of 30,467.4 kg h(-1) was achieved by the combined
   application of biochar and synthetic fertilizer as this combination
   resulted in the maximum net benefit (\$4433.98 ha(-1)) in comparison
   with control treatment that had net loss of \$- 2621.49 ha(-1). It is
   therefore concluded that biochar amendment of soils resembling to that
   of the Atlantic Canada representative soil used in this study, with a
   mix of recommended NPK for, can formulate a smart precision farming
   nutrient management technique for this region subject to the field
   trials and replicate experimental treatments for more than three times.},

Abstract = {Precision agriculture is crucial for ensuring food security in a growing
   global population. Nutrients, their presence, concentration, and
   effectiveness, are key components in data-driven agriculture. Assessing
   macro and micro-nutrients, as well as factors such as water and pH,
   helps determine soil fertility, which is vital for supporting healthy
   plant growth and high crop yields. Insufficient soil nutrient assessment
   during continuous cropping can threaten long-term agricultural
   viability. Soil nutrients need to be measured and replenished after each
   harvest for optimal yield. However, existing soil testing procedures are
   expensive and time-consuming. The proposed research aims to assess soil
   nutrient levels, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, to
   provide critical information and guidance on restoring optimal soil
   fertility. In this research, a novel chip-level colorimeter is
   fabricated to detect the N and P elements of soil onto a handheld
   colorimeter or spectrophotometer. Chemical reaction with soil solution
   generates color in the presence of nutrients, which are then
   quantitatively measured using sensors. The test samples are collected
   from various farmlands, and the results are validated with laboratory
   analysis of samples using spectrophotometers used in laboratories. ANOVA
   test has been performed in which F value > 1 in our study indicates
   statistically significant differences between the group means. The
   alternate hypothesis, which proposes the presence of significant
   differences between the groups, is supported by the data. The device
   created in this paper has crucial potential in terms of environmental
   and biological applications.},

Title = {Retrieving Heterogeneous Surface Soil Moisture at 100m Across the Globe
   via Fusion of Remote Sensing and Land Surface Parameters},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2},
Month = {OCT 28},
Abstract = {Successful monitoring of soil moisture dynamics at high spatio-temporal
   resolutions globally is hampered by the heterogeneity of soil hydraulic
   properties in space and complex interactions between water and the
   environmental variables that control it. Current soil moisture
   monitoring schemes via in situ station networks are sparsely distributed
   while remote sensing satellite soil moisture maps have a very coarse
   spatial resolution. In this study, an empirical surface soil moisture
   (SSM) model was established via fusion of in situ continental and
   regional scale soil moisture networks, remote sensing data (SMAP and
   Sentinel-1) and high-resolution land surface parameters (e.g., soil
   texture, terrain) using a quantile random forest (QRF) algorithm. The
   model had a spatial resolution of 100m and performed well under
   cultivated, herbaceous, forest, and shrub soils (overall R-2 = 0.524,
   RMSE = 0.07 m(3) m(-3)). It has a relatively good transferability at the
   regional scale among different soil moisture networks (mean RMSE =
   0.08-0.10 m(3) m(-3)). The global model was applied to map SSM dynamics
   at 30-100m across a field-scale soilmoisture network (TERENO-Wustebach)
   and an 80-ha cultivated cropland in Wisconsin, USA. Without the use of
   local training data, the model was able to delineate the variations in
   SSM at the field scale but contained large bias. With the addition of
   10\% local training datasets ({''}spiking{''}), the bias of the model
   was significantly reduced. The QRF model was relatively insensitive to
   the resolution of Sentinel-1 data but was affected by the resolution and
   accuracy of soil maps. It was concluded that the empirical model has the
   potential to be applied elsewhere across the globe to map SSM at the
   regional to field scales for research and applications. Future research
   is required to improve the performance of the model by incorporating
   more field-scale soil moisture sensor networks and assimilation with
   process-based models.},

   yield values and vegetation index values derived from satellite images.
   A total of 281 soil samples were taken at a 1-km resolution in order to
   quantify the spatial dynamics of soil physical, chemical and fertility
   indicators. Of the study area, 40.0\% had very high fertile and high

   Only about one-third of the total area had low and very low fertility.
   These results were validated using a 3-year yield values belong to

   relationship of SFI with yield (r2 = 0.88) and RE-OSAVI (r2 = 0.83) was

Title = {Long-term effects of harvest on boreal forest soils in relation to a
   remote sensing-based soil moisture index},
Journal = {FOREST ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {462},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Storing a significant portion of the global carbon (C) stocks, soils of
   the boreal forest display a high degree of spatial heterogeneity across
   the landscape, arising from variation in forest structure and landscape
   morphology, as well as natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Because
   of this high degree of variability, accurately quantifying C storage in
   this ecosystem poses a challenge. Forestry is an important feature of
   Canada's natural resource-based economy, but there is still considerable
   uncertainty on how management practices will affect boreal soil C
   sequestration in the long-term. With increasing pressures due to a
   changing climate and intensified forest management, developing better
   tools and techniques to quantify soil C dynamics is of paramount
   importance. In this study, we measured soil C stocks and associated
   properties in the forest floors and mineral soils (0-7 cm) of
   conifer-dominated and deciduous (broadleaf)-dominated boreal forest
   stands, 17 years following variable retention harvest. We investigated
   if the We Areas Mapping-based depth-to-water (DTW) index, derived from
   remotely sensed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, was related to
   soil properties of unharvested stands. In addition, relationships
   between harvest-induced changes in soil properties and the DTW index
   were examined. In unharvested stands, several forest floor properties
   were related to DTW. However, these relationships were stand-specific.
   In unharvested conifer-dominated stands, forest floor C stocks were
   positively related to site wetness, while in harvested stands there was
   no relationship; this suggests that C was differentially lost from
   wetter sites following harvesting. Conversely, in unharvested
   deciduous-dominated stands, there was no relationship between forest
   floor C stocks and site wetness, but in harvested stands, wetter sites
   had higher C stocks. The DTW index was more strongly related to soil
   properties in the mineral soil (0-7 cm) than in the forest floor. In
   both forest cover types, mineral soil C and N concentrations, and C
   stocks, increased with increasing wetness. Relationships between mineral
   soil properties and DTW were not stand-specific, and were of similar
   magnitude under deciduous-dominated and conifer-dominated cover. In
   addition, harvest and forest regeneration had limited impact on the
   relationships between DTW and mineral soil properties. This study
   highlights the potential of using remote sensing and the DTW index to
   model forest floor and mineral soil properties in the boreal forest. In
   turn, this approach may be utilized in effective forest management
   strategies that aim to conserve boreal C stocks.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter for the circulation of water and energy
   exchange between surface and the atmosphere, playing an important role
   in hydrology, agriculture, and meteorology. Traditional methods for
   monitoring soil moisture suffer from spatial discontinuity,
   time-consuming processes, and high costs. Remote sensing technology
   enables the non-destructive and efficient retrieval of land information,
   allowing rapid soil moisture monitoring to schedule crop irrigation and
   evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Satellite data with different
   resolutions provide different observation scales. Evaluating the
   accuracy of estimating soil moisture based on open and free satellite
   data, as well as exploring the comprehensiveness and adaptability of
   different satellites for soil moisture temporal and spatial
   observations, are important research contents of current soil moisture
   monitoring. The study utilized three types of satellite data, namely
   GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4, with respective temporal and spatial
   resolutions of 16 m (every 4 days), 30 m (every 16 days), and 50 m
   (daily). The gray relational analysis (GRA) was employed to identify
   vegetation indices that selected sensitivity to soil moisture at varying
   depths (3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm). Then, this study employed random forest
   (RF), Extra Tree (ETr), and linear regression (LR) algorithms to
   estimate soil moisture at different depths with optical satellite data
   sources. The results showed that the accuracy of soil moisture
   estimation was different at different growth stages. The model accuracy
   exhibited an upward trend during the middle and late growth stages,
   coinciding with higher vegetation coverage; however, it demonstrated a
   decline in accuracy during the early and late growth stages due to
   either the absence or limited presence of vegetation. Among the three
   satellite images, the vegetation indices derived from GF-1 exhibited
   were more sensitive to vegetation characteristics and demonstrated
   superior soil moisture estimation accuracy (with R2 ranging 0.129-0.928,
   RMSE ranging 0.017-0.078), followed by Landsat-8 (with R2 ranging
   0.117-0.862, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.088). The soil moisture estimation
   accuracy of GF-4 was the worst (with R2 ranging 0.070-0.921, RMSE
   ranging 0.020-0.140). Thus, GF-1 is suitable for vegetated areas. In
   addition, the ETr model outperformed the other models in both accuracy
   and stability (ETr model: R2 ranging from 0.117 to 0.928, RMSE ranging
   from 0.021 to 0.091; RF model: R2 ranging from 0.225 to 0.926, RMSE
   ranging from 0.019 to 0.085; LR model: R2 ranging from 0.048 to 0.733,
   RMSE ranging from 0.030 to 0.144). Utilizing GF-1 is recommended to
   construct the ETr model for assessing soil moisture variations in the
   farming land of northern China. Therefore, in cases where there are
   limited ground sample data, it is advisable to utilize
   high-spatiotemporal-resolution remote sensing data, along with machine
   learning algorithms such as ETr and RF, which are suitable for small
   samples, for soil moisture estimation.},

Abstract = {In arid and semi-arid regions, soil moisture and salinity are important
   elements to control regional ecology and climate, vegetation growth and
   land function. Soil moisture and salt content are more important in arid
   wetlands. The Ebinur Lake wetland is an important part of the ecological
   barrier of Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, China. The Ebinur Lake Basin is a
   representative area of the arid climate and ecological degradation in
   central Asia. It is of great significance to study the spatial
   distribution of soil moisture and salinity and its causes for land and
   wetland ecological restoration in the Ebinur Lake Basin. Based on the
   field measurement and Landsat 8 satellite data, a variety of remote
   sensing indexes related to soil moisture and salinity were tested and
   compared, and the prediction models of soil moisture and salinity were
   established, and the accuracy of the models was assessed. Among them,
   the salinity indexes D1 and D2 were the latest ones that we proposed
   according to the research area and data. The distribution maps of soil
   moisture and salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin were retrieved from
   remote sensing data, and the correlation analysis between soil moisture
   and salinity was performed. Among several soil moisture and salinity
   prediction indexes, the normalized moisture index NDWI had the highest
   correlation with soil moisture, and the salinity index D2 had the
   highest correlation with soil salinity, reaching 0.600 and 0.637,
   respectively. The accuracy of the BP neural network model for estimating
   soil salinity was higher than the one of other models; R-2 = 0.624, RMSE
   = 0.083 S/m. The effect of the cubic function prediction model for
   estimating soil moisture was also higher than that of the BP neural
   network, support vector machine and other models; R-2 = 0.538, RMSE =
   0.230. The regularity of soil moisture and salinity changes seemed to be
   consistent, the correlation degree was 0.817, and the synchronous change
   degree was higher. The soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin was
   generally low in the surrounding area, high in the middle area, high in
   the lake area and low in the vegetation coverage area. The soil moisture
   in the Ebinur Lake Basin slightly decreased outward with the Ebinur Lake
   as the center and was higher in the west and lower in the east. However,
   the spatial distribution of soil moisture had a higher mutation rate and
   stronger heterogeneity than that of soil salinity.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature are vital
   variables in water-energy balance, eco-hydrological processes, and water
   resources management, which can be influenced by watershed management
   activities. This research focused on the spatial and temporal
   variability of soil moisture, vegetation cover, land surface
   temperature, and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) under a
   biological watershed management practice in the Taleghan paired
   watershed, namely, treated (TW) and control watersheds (CW), in Alborz
   province, Iran. In this research, along with the remote sensing
   techniques, the soil moisture and vegetation cover data were measured
   and statistically analyzed in the three aspects of both TW and CW during
   a growth period from May to October 2017. The results indicated that
   soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature values in
   the paired watershed were significantly different at the 0.01 level
   during the study period. The increased vegetation cover in the TW had an
   inverse effect on the land surface temperature and TVDI, while directly
   impacted the soil moisture content. The average TVDI in the CW was 0.83,
   while this index was found to be 0.69 in the TW. Unlike the vegetation
   cover and soil moisture, the results revealed that the southern aspects
   had the highest TVDI and land surface temperature compared to the
   northern and eastern aspects of both watersheds. However, the increased
   vegetation cover as a biological watershed management activity in the
   steep terrain and mountainous areas of TW led to an increased soil
   moisture and a decreased land surface temperature and soil dryness. As a
   result, decreasing soil dryness in the TW can exert vital controls on
   the water resources and increasing water availability. In the arid and
   semiarid countries such as Iran, a proper watershed management activity
   can effectively increase soil moisture and water availability in the
   watersheds. In particular, the vegetation cover protection and
   biological practices can be considered as practical solutions in the
   rehabilitation of exhausted watersheds in arid and semiarid
   environments.},

Abstract = {Negative nitrogen balance represents a major factor causing low potato
   yield in potato growing areas of Kenya while its excessive surplus poses
   a significant environmental concern. In order to synchronize this
   tradeoff, a field trial integrating potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) with
   lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) and dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) in
   intercropping system was conducted in the upper midland {[}1552 m above
   sea level (masl), lower highland (1894 masl) and upper highland (2552
   masl)] agro-ecological zones of Kenya. Nitrogen gains from
   mineralization, fertilization, biological fixation, and outputs from
   biomass accumulation, leaching, volatilization and soil erosion were
   quantified using standard procedures. Soil N balance ranged from - 10.7
   to - 18.1 kg N ha(-1) for sole potato, 4.1 to 6.6 kg N ha(-1) for
   intercropping and 2.9 to 22.3 kg N ha(-1) for sole legumes. The
   intermediate range of polyphenol and lignin contents in intercropping
   enhanced N mineralization with peak N release of 8 to 9 kg N ha(-1)
   matching with peak N uptake by potato (19.9 to 31.2 kg N ha(-1)).
   Nitrate was leached below the active root zone in sole potato cropping
   (4.2 to 46.6 kg N ha(-1)), a process that was diverged by the deep root
   systems of legume intercrops. These results suggest that legume
   intercropping can provide a means of balancing the nitrogen retained in
   the biomass and soil, thus offering a mechanism for optimizing the soil
   N balance in smallholder potato farming systems.},

Title = {Evaluating the Hydrus-1D Model Optimized by Remote Sensing Data for Soil
   Moisture Simulations in the Maize Root Zone},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The Hydrus-1D model is widely used for soil water content (SWC)
   simulations, wherein the exact configuration of soil hydraulic
   parameters is key to accuracy. To assess the feasibility of using
   ``low-cost{''} multi-source remote sensing data to optimize the
   parameters of the Hydrus-1D model, five types of soil hydrodynamic
   parameter acquisition methods were designed for comparative evaluation,
   including the use of default parameters for soil texture types (DSHP),
   predictions from three and five soil mechanical composition parameters
   (NNP3/NNP5), inverse solutions from measured historical data (ISHD), and
   innovative introduction of historical remote sensing data (ERA-5 land
   reanalysis information and MODIS LAI products) instead of ground
   measured data for the inverse solution (ISRS). Two spring maize crops
   were planted in Beijing, China, in 2021 and 2022. Meteorological, soil,
   and crop data were collected as real measurements of the true values
   during the growth period. The boundary flux characteristics of the model
   simulation results were analyzed. The accuracy differences in the five
   approaches were compared from three perspectives: overall root zone,
   growth stage, and soil depth. The results showed that (1)
   evapotranspiration was the main pathway for soil water depletion in the
   root zone of maize; the actual total evapotranspiration accounted for
   68.26 and 69.43\% of the total precipitation in 2012 and 2022,
   respectively. (2) The accuracy of the SWC simulations in the root zone
   was acceptable for different approaches in the following order: NNP5
   (root mean squared error (RMSE) = 5.47\%) > ISRS (RMSE = 5.48\%) > NNP3
   (RMSE = 5.66\%) > ISHD (RMSE = 5.68\%) > DSHP (RMSE = 6.57\%). The ISRS
   approach based on remote sensing data almost achieved the best
   performance while effectively reducing the workload and cost. (3) The
   accuracy of the SWC simulation at different growth stages was ranked as
   follows: seedling stage (mean absolute error (MAE) = 3.29\%) > tassel
   stage (MAE = 4.68\%) > anthesis maturity stage (MAE = 5.52\%). (4) All
   approaches' simulation errors exhibited a decreasing trend with
   increasing soil depth. The ISHD approach, based on the measured data,
   achieved the best performance at a depth of 60 cm (MAE = 2.8\%). The
   Hydrus-1D model optimized using multi-source remote sensing data can
   effectively simulate SWC in the maize root zone with low working cost,
   which is significant for applications in areas where it is difficult to
   obtain field soil hydrodynamic property parameters to simulate SWC at a
   global scale.},

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture knowledge is important, especially in agriculture
   and irrigation management. Properties of microwave remote sensing like
   penetration power and longer wavelength facilitate retrieval of surface
   soil moisture. ALOS PALSAR-2, quad polarized data are used to retrieve
   surface soil moisture using polarization decomposition techniques in a
   marginal farmer small-scale maize field. The focus of the study is to
   explore the utility of ALOS PALSAR-2 in retrieving surface soil moisture
   using the polarization decomposition technique. The demonstration of the
   study is carried out in Malavalli village, southern India, an
   agricultural predominant area. The study involves field soil moisture
   sampling in synchronous with satellite pass, measuring soil properties,
   preprocessing of SAR data, polarization decomposition, proportional
   analysis, regression analysis, model calibration and validation. Van Zyl
   decomposition gave the highest surface scattering component (43\%) and
   reduced volumetric scattering component compared to Yamaguchi and
   Freeman-Durden decomposition. Surface scattering component of Yamaguchi
   decomposition gave a good coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.8029)
   with field-measured surface soil moisture. The semi-empirical model
   (SEM) was developed using surface scattering component and
   depolarization ratio with adjusted R-2 = 0.75 at 95\% confidence
   interval. On its comparison with existing soil moisture models, it is
   observed that the developed model is performing well with RMSE and
   AE(max) of 1.81 and 2.88, respectively. Implying the applicability of
   ALOS PALSAR-2 in soil moisture retrieval in marginal farmer small-scale
   maize fields gave satisfactory results of accuracy.},

Title = {Combining FDR and ERT for monitoring soil moisture and temperature
   patterns in undulating terrain in south-eastern Norway},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {212},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The occurrence of freeze-thaw cycles modifies water infiltration
   processes and surface runoff generation. Related processes are complex
   and are not yet fully investigated at field scale. While local weather
   conditions and soil management practices are the most important factors
   in both runoff generation and surface erosion processes, local terrain
   heterogeneities may significantly influence soil erosion processes in
   catchments with undulating terrain. This paper presents a field-based
   investigation of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in subsurface soil
   moisture and soil temperature associated with freezing, thawing, and
   snowmelt infiltration. The field setup consists of a combination of
   traditional point measurements performed with frequency domain
   reflectometry (FDR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The
   transect was approximately 70 m long and spanned an entire depression
   with a north-facing slope (average slope of 11.5\%) and a south-facing
   slope (average slope of 9.7\%). The whole depression was entirely
   covered with stubble. Observed resistivity patterns correspond well to
   the measured soil moisture patterns. During the observation period, the
   north facing slope froze earlier and deeper compared with the south
   facing slope. Freeze-thaw cycles were less pronounced in the
   north-facing slope than in the south-facing slope. There were also
   differences in soil temperature and soil moisture patterns between lower
   and upper parts of the monitored depression. These indicate that
   initiation and development of runoff related processes, and consequently
   soil erosion, in regions with freeze-thaw cycles may differ
   significantly depending on local terrain characteristics. Consequently,
   it indicates that spatial terrain heterogeneities, especially slope
   aspects, may be important when studying soil erosion processes, water
   flow and nutrient leaching in lowlands where patchy snowpacks and
   dynamic freeze -thaw cycles are predominating.},

Title = {Comparison of bagging, boosting and stacking algorithms for surface soil
   moisture mapping using optical-thermal-microwave remote sensing
   synergies},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {217},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil moisture information is key to irrigation water management, drought
   monitoring, and yield prediction. It plays a vital role in the water
   cycle and energy budget between the earth's surface and atmosphere.
   Hence, its monitoring is crucial for both natural and anthropogenic
   environments. While the current remote sensing-based global SM products
   available at coarser resolution (3/15 km) are unsuitable for field-level
   operations, the most widely used microwave remote sensing suffers from
   model complexities and in-situ data requirements. Weather conditions
   limit the alternate approaches such as optical/thermal. This study aims
   to map surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m spatial resolution in a
   semi-arid region by fusing optical, thermal, and microwave remote
   sensing data using bagging, boosting, and stacking machine learning
   approaches. The reference data were collected using a soil moisture
   meter. The covariates included radar backscatter from Sentinel-1,
   visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, land surface temperature,
   and spectral indices derived from Landsat 8. Boruta algorithm was used
   for feature selection which identified radar backscatter, modified
   normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature as the
   most critical covariates impacting the SSM. The random forest (RF)
   showed the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.71), and least root
   mean square error (RMSE = 5.17\%). The cubist model had the least mean
   bias error (MBE = 0.21\%) during independent validation. Stacking of
   cubist, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and RF using elastic net
   (ELNET) as meta-learner further reduced the MBE (0.18\%) and RMSE
   (5.03\%) during the validation. Overall, stacking multiple machine
   learning models improved model prediction and can be recommended to
   improve the digital soil moisture mapping.},

Abstract = {In countries characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, a precise
   determination of soil moisture conditions on the field scale is
   critically important, especially in the first crop growth stages, to
   schedule irrigation and to avoid wasting water. The objective of this
   study was to apply the operative methodology that allowed surface soil
   moisture (SSM) content in a semi-arid environment to be estimated. SSM
   retrieval was carried out by combining two scattering models (IEM and
   WCM), supplied by backscattering coefficients at the VV polarization
   obtained from the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), a vegetation
   descriptor NDVI obtained from the optical sensor, among other essential
   parameters. The inversion of these models was performed by Neural
   Networks (NN). The combined models were calibrated by the Sentinel 1 and
   Sentinel 2 data collected on bare soil, and in cereal, pea and onion
   crop fields. To retrieve SSM, these scattering models need accurate
   measurements of the roughness surface parameters, standard deviation of
   the surface height (hrms) and correlation length (L). This work used a
   photogrammetric acquisition system carried on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
   (UAV) to reconstruct digital surface models (DSM), which allowed these
   soil roughness parameters to be acquired in a large portion of the
   studied fields. The obtained results showed that the applied improved
   methodology effectively estimated SSM on bare and cultivated soils in
   the principal early growth stages. The bare soil experimentation yielded
   an R-2 = 0.74 between the estimated and observed SSMs. For the cereal
   field, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs yielded R-2
   = 0.71. In the experimental pea fields, the relation between the
   estimated and measured SSMs revealed R-2 = 0.72 and 0.78, respectively,
   for peas 1 and peas 2. For the onion experimentation, the highest R-2
   equaled 0.5 in the principal growth stage (leaf development), but the
   crop R-2 drastically decreased to 0.08 in the completed growth phase.
   The acquired results showed that the applied improved methodology proves
   to be an effective tool for estimating the SSM on bare and cultivated
   soils in the principal early growth stages.},

Title = {Agricultural Drought Monitoring via the Assimilation of SMAP Soil
   Moisture Retrievals Into a Global Soil Water Balance Model},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BIG DATA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {3},
Month = {APR 9},
Abstract = {From an agricultural perspective, drought refers to an unusual
   deficiency of plant available water in the root-zone of the soil
   profile. This paper focuses on evaluating the benefit of assimilating
   soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
   mission into the USDA-FAS Palmer model for agricultural drought
   monitoring. This will be done by examining the standardized soil
   moisture anomaly index. The skill of the SMAP-enhanced Palmer model is
   assessed over three agricultural regions that have experienced major
   drought since the launch of SMAP in early 2015: (1) the 2015 drought in
   California (CA), USA, (2) the 2017 drought in South Africa, and (3) the
   2018 mid-winter drought in Australia. During these three events, the
   SMAP-enhanced Palmer soil moisture estimates (PM+SMAP) are compared
   against the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations
   (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) products. Results demonstrate the benefit of assimilating SMAP
   and confirm its potential for improving U.S. Department of
   Agriculture-Foreign Agricultural Service root-zone soil moisture
   information generated using the Palmer model. In particular, PM+SMAP
   soil moisture estimates are shown to enhance the spatial variability of
   Palmer model root-zone soil moisture estimates and adjust the Palmer
   model drought response to improve its consistency with ancillary CHIRPS
   precipitation and NDVI information.},

Title = {Soil organic matter mapping using INLA-SPDE with remote sensing based
   soil moisture indices and Fourier transforms decomposed variables},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {437},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Generating accurate spatial information on soil organic matter (SOM) is
   increasingly important in the context of global environmental change.
   Both prediction models and environmental covariates influence the
   mapping results and accuracy, making them important factors in SOM
   mapping. The Bayesian spatial model INLA-SPDE is an emerging model, that
   has shown potential in digital soil mapping (DSM), but its application
   is still limited. Soil moisture, which affects soil water status and the
   decomposition of SOM, can be a potential predictor for mapping SOM.
   However, the difficulty of obtaining soil moisture measurements over a
   large area using groundbased methods hinders its application. Recently,
   high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) has provided a possible way
   to generate soil moisture indices over a large area. However, the
   effectiveness of RS-based soil moisture indices on SOM mapping is
   unknown. Fourier transforms decomposed (FTD) variables based on
   vegetation indices have been proven effective in detecting time-series
   patterns of crop growth, thereby improving the mapping accuracy of
   farmland. Yet, the effectiveness of FTD variables has not been verified
   in other vegetation-covered areas. This paper examines the use of
   INLA-SPDE with three RS-based soil moisture indices (NSDSIs) and six FTD
   variables for SOM mapping compared to Random Forest (RF), in a study
   area with diverse vegetation cover in Anhui Province, China. The finding
   indicates that with the optimal combination of environmental covariates,
   INLA-SPDE yields a higher prediction accuracy than RF, with an increase
   of 18\% in R2. Either the RS-based soil moisture indices covariates or
   the FTD variables are effective in mapping SOM. When compared to using
   only natural environmental covariates, the best combination including
   RS-based soil moisture indices and FTD variables improved the mapping
   accuracy by 25\% in terms of R2, 21\% of LCCC, and 11\% of RMSE.
   Furthermore, quantitative prediction uncertainty maps are derived based
   on the INLA-SPDE. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of INLA-SPDE
   model with the RS-based soil moisture indices and Fourier transforms
   decomposed variables for SOM mapping.},

Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Although rice is a major agricultural product in northeast Thailand, its
   productivity is low and unstable because rice is cultivated under
   rainfed conditions and there are issues with soil salinization. In this
   region, some of the paddy fields have been abandoned because of severe
   soil salinization. Therefore, effective agricultural management
   strategies are needed to manage soil salinization for achieving stable
   agricultural production. To realize effective management strategies, it
   is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of soil
   salinization. To evaluate and update the spatiotemporal soil
   salinization using remote sensing data, we first evaluate the
   relationship between soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and soil
   moisture content (SMC) during thy seasons. Subsequently, the effect of
   changes in this relationship on the normalized difference salinity index
   (NDSI) derived from remote sensing data for estimating soil ECe is
   evaluated. The relationship between ECe and NDSI, depending on the soil
   moisture conditions in the study area, is clarified. The findings of
   this study indicate that for estimating ECe using the NDSI, it is
   necessary to consider not only soil moisture conditions but also its
   quality at the time of satellite observation.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring is essential for a variety of applications
   including agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring. However,
   soil moisture sensors may be expensive and require batteries or other
   energy sources, making them unsuitable for remote or off-grid locations
   and farmers. Improper e-waste management of short-lived sensing
   components can reveal the contradictions of solutions aimed at
   environmental sustainability, which also degrade environmental health.
   Therefore, the development of low-cost, off-grid, biodegradable in-situ
   soil moisture sensing system (SMSS) is necessary for these regions. This
   article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in
   low-cost, off-grid, and biodegradable in-situ soil moisture sensing. It
   highlights lowcost SMSS components including hardware (microcontrollers
   and communication modules), software, and offgrid ambient energy
   sources. It also highlights the current research in biodegradable
   polymers used for moisture sensing. The challenges in combining
   low-cost, off-grid, and biodegradable soil moisture sensing are
   identified as a research gap. Finally, the underlining question of the
   ``perfect{''} choice of SMSS is explored based on the trade-offs of
   performance, operational feasibility, and the newly proposed aspect of
   biodegradability, consequently suggesting context-specific decisions by
   consciously managing these tradeoffs.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important factor affecting the change of land
   surface hydrological processes and the distribution of material and
   energy exchanges between the land and atmosphere and vegetation's
   temporal and spatial distributions, especially in arid and semi-arid
   regions. This paper focuses on soil moisture features across Northwest
   China, the core region of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Six soil moisture
   datasets from the period 1981-2020 were employed, which included ERA5
   (the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Atmospheric
   Reanalysis 5), ESA-CCI (European Space Agency Climate Change
   Initiative), GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System), MERRA-2 (The
   Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version
   2), RSSSM (A Remote Sensing-based global 10-day resolution Surface Soil
   Moisture dataset), and SSM-Feng (Regional multimodal fusion of surface
   soil moisture data in China). The temporal and spatial variation of the
   linear trend and abrupt change characteristics at seasonal and annual
   scale were explored. The results are as follows: 1) ESA-CCI, GLDAS, and
   MERRA-2 showed a slow increase in annual soil moisture tendency at a
   rate of less than 0.001 m(3)/m(3)/year, while ERA5 and SSM-Feng showed a
   significant decreasing linear trend at a rate of 1.31 x 10(-4)
   m(3)/m(3)/year and 1.01 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year (p < 0.05),
   respectively. 2) In autumn and winter, only GLDAS and MERRA-2 showed
   significant increasing trends. In the growing season (i.e., from April
   to October), the soil moisture of ESA-CCI, GLDAS, and MERRA-2
   significantly increased at the rates of 3.29 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year,
   3.30 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year, and 6.64 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year (p <
   0.05), respectively. 3) ERA5 and ESA-CCI have frequent abrupt changes in
   1984, 1987, and 2006 for ERA5, 2010-2012 and 2019-2020 for ESA-CCI. 4)
   In terms of spatial variations, most datasets show that soil moisture
   has increased across most regions. The ERA5, ESA-CCI, GLDAS, MERRA-2,
   and SSM-Feng datasets show decreased soil moisture in the Tarim Basin.
   The conclusions of this study deepen the understanding of temporal and
   spatial variation in soil moisture in arid areas of Northwest China.
   Through these conclusions, a certain theoretical basis can be provided
   for the complex water cycle process in the arid region.},

Abstract = {Purpose This paper aims to determine and evaluate the calibration curve
   for low-cost electronic sensors in soils from a reclaimed and degraded
   area in the Brazilian semiarid region. Design/methodology/approach The
   probes were made, programmed and inserted in soil previously conditioned
   in polyethylene cylinders. The sets ``cylinder + probe + soil{''} were
   subjected to saturation for a period of 24 h and, subsequently,
   gravitational drainage at room temperature and daily weighings were
   performed. When the set reached constant weight, the samples were taken
   to dry in an oven at 105 degrees C to determine the dry mass and later,
   determine the gravimetric moisture and convert it into volumetric. The
   volumetric moistures obtained were related to measured frequency
   variations and the adjustments were analyzed by regression, which was
   subjected to analysis of variance (p = 0.05), and related by a
   third-degree polynomial equation whose quality of the fit was verified
   with coefficient of determination (R-2). Findings The obtained moistures
   were related to the estimated moistures and evaluated by the
   root-mean-square error and straight 1:1. The results demonstrate that
   the sensors are not accurate for moistures in saturation, but
   representative and statistically acceptable results for moistures up to
   field capacity. Originality/value This paper has not been published
   before in its current, or similar form.},

Title = {From point to field scale-indirect monitoring of soil moisture
   variations at the DWD test site in Falkenberg},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {427},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Information regarding the spatial distribution of soil water content is
   key in many disciplines and applications including soil and atmospheric
   sciences, hydrology, and agricultural engineering. Thus, within the past
   decades various experimental methods and strategies have been developed
   to map spatial variations in soil moisture distribution and to monitor
   temporal changes. Our study examines the combination of electrical
   resistivity mapping and point observations of soil moisture to infer the
   spatial and the temporal variability of soil moisture. Over a period of
   around two years, we performed field measurements on six days to collect
   repeated electrical resistivity mapping data for a nine-hectare test
   site south-east of Berlin, Germany. Permanently installed TDR probes,
   temporary TDR measurements within permanently installed tubes, and
   gravimetric measurements using soil samples provided soil moisture data
   at various selected points. In addition, soil analysis and
   classification results are available for 132 regularly distributed
   positions up to depths of 1.2 m. We compare and link three-dimensional
   resistivity models obtained via data inversion to soil composition and
   soil moisture as provided by our point data. Both the soil samples and
   the resistivity models indicate a two-layer medium characterized by a
   sandy top layer with varying thickness and a loamy bottom soil. For all
   six field campaigns, we observe similar resistivity patterns reflecting
   the temporally stable influence of soil texture. While the overall
   patterns are stable, the range of resistivity values changes with soil
   moisture. Finally, to estimate spatial models of soil moisture, we link
   our soil moisture and resistivity data using empirical petrophysical
   models relying on a second order polynomial function. We observe a mean
   prediction error for soil moisture of +/-0.034 m3 \& BULL; m? 3 using
   all observation points while we notice that point-specific models
   further reduce the error. Thus, we conclude that our experimental and
   data analysis strategies represent a reliable approach to establish
   site-specific models and to estimate three-dimensional moisture
   distribution including temporal variations.},

Title = {One-Year Monitoring of Daily Earthworm Cast Production: Surface Cast
   Contribution to Soil Fertility in a Subtropical Forest},
Journal = {FORESTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The process of earthworm casting plays an important role in soil
   fertility. The contributions of earthworm casts to soil nutrients
   dynamics cannot be fully understood unless the temporal changes in
   earthworm cast production and the related nutrient resource pools are
   explored in the field. Here, we recorded the daily surface cast
   production of earthworms and monthly change patterns of carbon (C),
   nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in casts in a subtropical plantation
   for one year and compared the nutrient concentrations and microbial
   community traits (structure and bacterial activity) in casts with those
   in bulk soils. Our objectives were to characterize the temporal patterns
   of earthworm cast production and the C and nutrients in casts and to
   assess the potential contribution of earthworm casts to soil fertility.
   The results showed that the annual surface cast production at the study
   site was 8.3 tons ha(-1); monthly cast production was >80 g m(-2) during
   April to November and <30 g m(-2) during December to March. The annual
   outputs of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN) and total P (TP) in
   surface casts were 68.10, 4.84 and 0.38 g m(-2), respectively; the
   annual outputs of available P (AP), NH4+-N and NO3--N were 22.4, 147.0
   and 61.3 mg m(-2), respectively. The concentrations of TOC and TN in
   casts were higher during warm months, but NH4+-N was higher during cold
   months, while both the concentrations of TP and AP in casts were
   constant throughout the year. The nutrient concentrations were
   1.6-4.3-fold greater, and the microbial biomass C and N contents were
   7-8-fold greater in earthworm casts than those in bulk soils. However,
   the bacterial stress index (BSI) was significantly greater in casts than
   in the bulk soil, which implies that bacteria in casts were under
   stress. Accordingly, the ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass (F/B) was
   significantly higher in casts than in the bulk soil. Earthworm casting
   activity can process forest soil into a ``new soil{''}, which forms
   large amounts of earthworm-induced hotspots of soil fertility. These
   resource pools in casts, with monthly fluctuated C and N and constant P,
   could be more readily accessed by fungi rather than bacteria. Earthworm
   casting activity potentially changes both the nutrients available and
   the interactions of plants and rhizosphere microbiota.},

Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze agronomic drought in a highly anthropogenic,
   semiarid region, the western Mediterranean region. The proposed study is
   based on Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and
   Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) satellite data describing the dynamics of
   vegetation cover and soil water content through the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Soil Water Index (SWI). Two
   drought indices were analyzed: the Vegetation Anomaly Index (VAI) and
   the Moisture Anomaly Index (MAI). The dynamics of the VAI were analyzed
   as a function of land cover deduced from the Copernicus land cover map.
   The effect of land cover and anthropogenic agricultural activities such
   as irrigation on the estimation of the drought index VAI was analyzed.
   The VAI dynamics were very similar for the shrub and forest classes. The
   contribution of vegetation cover (VAI) was combined with the effect of
   soil water content (MAI) through a new drought index called the global
   drought index (GDI) to conduct a global analysis of drought conditions.
   The implementation of this combination on different test areas in the

Title = {Soil moisture prediction based on integrating the CEEMDAN decomposition
   technique with LSTM in the proximity of Prosopis Juliflora},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {640},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Human-made adaptations in plant diversity, particularly the introduction
   of alien invasive plant species, can result in problems such as
   depletion of groundwater, extraction of natural water resources, and
   modifications in the local biodiversity. In addition to regulating
   ecosystems and accurate farming, precise forecasting of soil moisture in
   the vicinity of these exotic plant species can greatly assist in various
   other agricultural applications. In this study, we present an improved
   approach for predicting soil moisture levels at different depths in the
   vicinity of Prosopis Juliflora (IAPS) by integrating long short-term
   memory (LSTM) and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with
   adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). CEEMDAN is employed as a preprocessing and
   denoising technique to decompose the initial soil moisture data into
   several intrinsic mode functions (IMF). After that, LSTM is used to
   predict all the IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) parts from the CEEMDAN
   process. The individual prediction outcomes of each IMF are combined to
   obtain the final prediction results. Soil moisture measurements were
   collected continuously in the Coimbatore area of Tamil Nadu at
   multi-layer soil depths of 10 cm, 30 cm, 60 cm, and 100 cm. The provided
   data was utilized for training models and achieving optimal accuracy in
   forecasting soil moisture levels one month prior. The proposed
   CEEMDAN-LSTM model achieved the highest R2, ranging from 0.985 to 0.995
   at various depths when compared to RNN, LSTM, EMD-LSTM, EEMDLSTM models,
   and existing literature models. The results show that the proposed
   method works well at predicting soil moisture at different depths, which
   can help improve the planting pattern and schedule of native species to
   increase the area's green cover.},

Title = {SPATIAL VARIABILITY OF SOIL FERTILITY UNDER AGROFORESTRY SYSTEM AND

Journal = {BIOSCIENCE JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {39},
Abstract = {The usage of spatial tools might be helpful in the optimization of
   decision-making regarding soil management, with technologies that assist
   in the interpretation of information related to soil fertility.
   Therefore, the present study evaluated the spatial variability of
   chemical attributes of the soil under an agroforestry system compared to
   a native forest in the municipality of Tome-acu, Eastern Amazon, Brazil.
   Soil samples were performed at 36 points arranged in a 55 x 55 m grid.
   The soils were prepared and submitted to analysis in order to determine
   pH in H2O, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium and aluminium,
   available phosphorus, potential acidity, organic matter, bases
   saturation and aluminium saturation. For each soil attribute, the
   spherical, gaussian and exponential models were adjusted. After the
   semivariograms fitting, data interpolation for assessment of spatial
   variability of the variables was performed through ordinary kriging. The
   spherical and gaussian models were the most efficient models in
   estimation of soil attributes spatial variability, in most cases. Most
   of variables presented a regular spatial variability in their respective
   kriging maps, with some exceptions. In general, the kriging maps can be
   used, and we can take them as logistical maps for management and
   intervention practices in order to improve the soil fertility in the
   study areas. The results principal components indicate the need for
   integrated management of soil chemical attributes, with localized
   application of acidity correctors, fertilizers and other types of
   incomes, using the spatial variability of these fertility variables.},

Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},

Volume = {60},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-10},
Abstract = {Dairy activity expansion has resulted in increased manure volume
   produced, with the main destination application in agricultural areas.
   Accordingly, the aims of this study were to (i) evaluate the effects of
   dairy liquid manure (DLM), in addition to mineral fertilisation, on crop
   yields over a 9-year period and (ii) identify the soil chemical
   attributes modified by the manure, and which most affect grain yield.
   The experiment was conducted from 2005 to 2015 in a no-tillage system,
   in Parana state, Brazil, in soil with sandy clay loam texture. The
   treatments consisted of four doses of DLM (0, 60, 120, and 180 m(3)
   ha(-1) year(-1)) in addition to mineral fertiliser (same amount for all
   treatments). The DLM application increased maize and black oat yield but
   did not affect soybean and wheat yield. The DLM improved all evaluated
   soil chemical attributes and, even with application on the soil surface
   and no soil disturbance, the effect was observed in deeper layers. Maize
   grain yield was strongly correlated with soil chemical attributes,
   especially with pH (positive) and potential acidity (negative). The DLM
   application, in addition to mineral fertilisation, increased grain yield
   in a rotation system, especially of maize, with the effect mainly
   attributed to improvement in soil acidity attributes and the effect on
   nutrient availability. The estimated dose of DLM for maximum maize yield
   was 150 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), with 16\% increment in grain yield.},

Abstract = {Karst systems are characterized by a high subsurface heterogeneity, and
   their complex recharge processes are difficult to characterize.
   Experimental methods to study karst systems mostly focus on analysing
   the entire aquifer. Despite their important role in recharge processes,
   the soil and epikarst receive limited attention, and the few available
   studies were performed at sites of similar latitudes. In this paper, we
   describe a new monitoring network that allows for the improvement of the
   understanding of soil and epikarst processes by including different
   karst systems with different land-cover types in different climate
   regions. Here, we present preliminary data form the network and
   elaborate on their potential to answer research questions about the role
   of soil and epikarst on karstic water flow and storage. The network
   measures soil moisture at multiple points and depths to understand the
   partitioning of rainfall into infiltration, evapotranspiration, and
   groundwater recharge processes. We installed soil moisture probes at
   five different climate regions: Puerto Rico (tropical), Spain
   (Mediterranean), the United Kingdom (humid oceanic), Germany (humid
   mountainous), and Australia (dry semi-arid). At each of the five sites,
   we defined two 20m x 20m plots with different land-use types (forest and
   grassland). At each plot, 15 soil moisture profiles were randomly
   selected and probes at different depths from the topsoil to the epikarst
   (in total over 400 soil moisture probes) were installed. Covering the
   spatio-temporal variability of flow processes through a large number of
   profiles, our monitoring network will allow researchers to develop a new
   conceptual understanding of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge
   processes in karst regions across different climate regions and land-use
   types, and this will provide the base for quantitative assessment with
   physically based modelling approaches in the future.},

Abstract = {Applications of high amounts of nitrogen (N) fertilizer are essential
   for obtaining sustainable maize (Zea mays L.) yields but also result in
   low N-use efficiency (NUE) and cause a series of environmental problems.
   To optimize fertilizer management, it is necessary to determine the
   effects of soil fertility improvement on NUE and the fate of N
   fertilizer. In this study, we conducted a N-15 tracer pot experiment
   involving five different fertilizer treatments in soils with five
   different total organic carbon levels under field conditions. The
   average NUE ranged from 36 to 56\% N-15-urea and 0.1 to 0.2\% residual N
   in the first and second seasons. The N retained in the soil ranged from
   10 to 28\%, and the N lost to water and the atmosphere ranged from 29 to
   39\% in the five soils. Compared with that in the low-fertility soils,
   NUE in the high-fertility soils was 20-45\% greater, and N loss was 1
   -6\% lower. The results showed that higher soil fertility corresponded
   to higher NUE and lower N loss. We suggest that although the local
   customary N fertilizer application rate (N3; 165 kg N/ha) in the study
   area is reasonable for low-fertility soils, after soil fertility
   improvements, an approximately 50\% reduction of N fertilizer should be
   implemented.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SM) plays an essential role in the water and
   energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere. Low
   spatio-temporal resolution, about 25-40 km and 2-3 days, of the commonly
   used global microwave SM products limits their application at regional
   scales. In this study, we developed an algorithm to improve the SM
   spatio-temporal resolution using multi-source remote sensing data and a
   machine-learning model named the General Regression Neural Network
   (GRNN). First, six high spatial resolution input variables, including
   Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI), albedo, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Longitude (Lon) and
   Latitude (Lat), were selected and gap-filled to obtain high
   spatio-temporal resolution inputs. Then, the GRNN was trained at a low
   spatio-temporal resolution to obtain the relationship between SM and
   input variables. Finally, the trained GRNN was driven by the high
   spatio-temporal resolution input variables to obtain high
   spatio-temporal resolution SM. We used the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) SM over
   the Tibetan Plateau (TP) to test the algorithm. The results show that
   the algorithm could successfully improve the spatio-temporal resolution
   of FY-3B SM from 0.25 degrees and 2-3 days to 0.05 degrees and 1-day
   over the TP. The improved SM is consistent with the original product in
   terms of both spatial distribution and temporal variation. The high
   spatio-temporal resolution SM allows a better understanding of the
   diurnal and seasonal variations of SM at the regional scale,
   consequently enhancing ecological and hydrological applications,
   especially under climate change.},

   industry, produced in huge amount during the manufacture of phosphoric
   acid by economic wet process. Assessment of PG toxicity on soil has been
   poorly emphasized, therefore an efficient methods needs to be adopted to
   assess its toxic effect on soil fertility. We also need an effective
   eco-technological strategies for better waste PG management in order to
   improve the environmental health. The present study aimed to investigate
   the impact of PG toxicity on fertile soil and utilization of indigenous
   microorganisms for aerobic detoxification of PG contaminated soil to
   evaluate the scope for biostimulation based in situ bioremediation. In
   this study it is evident that application of PG to fertile soil in
   certain concentration results highly acidic, sulfate rich, aerobic
   environment, thus severely weakens the metabolic activity of the
   indigenous microorganisms. This investigation via microcosm based study
   further evaluated the intrinsic biotransformation ability of these
   microorganisms and found that was enhanced significantly (>95\%
   reduction in sulfate concentration in 180 days) with carbon, nitrogen
   and phosphate amendments. Community level physiological profiling
   analyses indicated distinct shift in metabolic abilities following
   carbon amendments. Our study for the first time may help to formulate a
   strategy in aerobic biotransformation of PG contaminated soil
   environment, yet appreciable rate by supplying adequate nutrients.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out with the aim of determining the appropriate
   plant (Kc) and Pan (Kp) coefficients for Class A Pan by using the
   irrigation program that was monitored by soil moisture in the potato
   (Solanum tuberosum L.). Irrigation treatments consisted of one
   irrigation interval (5 days) and five different levels (I-100, I-85,
   I-70, I-55, I-40) of soil water deficit measured before irrigations.
   Before thematic irrigations, all treatments were irrigated up to field
   capacity of the soil water content in 0-0.6 m depth. The results showed
   that as the water stress increased the yield and quality decreased in
   potatoes. Especially when more than 30\% water deficiency was applied, a
   significant decrease in efficiency and quality was observed. The highest
   tuber yield per plant was obtained with 1.2498 kg in the first year and
   1.2166 kg in the second year on I-100 treatment (p < 0.001). In the
   study, while the Kc values in the irrigation periods for the potato
   plant were 0.81 in the first year and 0.79 in the second year, Kp was
   determined as 1.23 and 1.20 for full irrigation (I-100) treatment,

Abstract = {One of the best preconditions for the sufficient monitoring of peat bog
   ecosystems is the collection, processing, and analysis of unique spatial
   data to understand peat bog dynamics. Over two seasons, we sampled
   groundwater level (GWL) and soil moisture (SM) ground truth data at two
   diverse locations at the Rokytka Peat bog within the Sumava Mountains,
   Czechia. These data served as reference data and were modeled with a
   suite of potential variables derived from digital surface models (DSMs)
   and RGB, multispectral, and thermal orthoimages reflecting
   topomorphometry, vegetation, and surface temperature information
   generated from drone mapping. We used 34 predictors to feed the random
   forest (RF) algorithm. The predictor selection, hyperparameter tuning,
   and performance assessment were performed with the target-oriented
   leave-location-out (LLO) spatial cross-validation (CV) strategy combined
   with forward feature selection (FFS) to avoid overfitting and to predict
   on unknown locations. The spatial CV performance statistics showed low
   (R-2 = 0.12) to high (R-2 = 0.78) model predictions. The predictor
   importance was used for model interpretation, where temperature had
   strong impact on GWL and SM, and we found significant contributions of
   other predictors, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Enhanced Red-Green-Blue Vegetation
   Index (ERGBVE), Shape Index (SHP), Green Leaf Index (GLI), Brightness
   Index (BI), Coloration Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), Primary Colours
   Hue Index (HI), Overall Hue Index (HUE), SAGA Wetness Index (TWI), Plan
   Curvature (PlnCurv), Topographic Position Index (TPI), and Vector
   Ruggedness Measure (VRM). Additionally, we estimated the area of
   applicability (AOA) by presenting maps where the prediction model
   yielded high-quality results and where predictions were highly uncertain
   because machine learning (ML) models make predictions far beyond
   sampling locations without sampling data with no knowledge about these
   environments. The AOA method is well suited and unique for planning and
   decision-making about the best sampling strategy, most notably with
   limited data.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Moisture content is a critical geotechnical property of soils affecting
   the compressibility, shear strength and permeability. Time domain
   reflectometry (TDR) has been widely used to monitor the soil moisture
   content in field and unit cell and column tests in laboratory, while the
   typical TDR probes can not be used in laboratory scaled-down model tests
   since their needle lengths are no less than 5 cm. This paper presents a
   novel-designed and fabricated three-needle mini TDR probe, whose needles
   are 22 mm in length and 2 mm in diameter with a 10 mm needle spacing.
   The suitability and performance of the mini TDR probe have been
   evaluated in laboratory. The effectiveness of the TDR probe was
   validated through monitoring the consolidation process of a 6-cm thick
   soil-bentonite (SB) slurry-trench cut-off wall in the centrifuge model
   test (acceleration = 20g). The results indicate that the mini TDR probe
   is capable of real-time monitoring of soil moisture content variation in
   the supergravity condition. The proposed mini TDR probe is fabricated
   easily and quickly and has a great potential for monitoring local soil
   moisture content in laboratory model tests.},

Abstract = {Investigating the growth behavior of plant root systems as a function of
   soil water is considered an important information for the study of root
   physiology. A non-invasive tool based on electromagnetic wave

   GHz, was developed using microstrip patch antennas to determine the
   volumetric moisture of soil in rhizoboxes. Antennas were placed on both
   sides of the rhizobox and, using a vector network analyzer, measured the
   S parameters. The dispersion parameter S-21 (dB) was also used to show
   the effect of different soil types and temperature on the measurement.
   In addition, system sensitivity, reproducibility and repeatability were
   evaluated. The quantitative results of the soil moisture, measured in
   rhizoboxes, presented in this paper, demonstrate that the microwave
   technique using microstrip patch antennas is a reliable, non-invasive
   and accurate system, and has shown potentially promising applications
   for measurement of rhizobox-based root phenotyping.},

Title = {Evaluation of microwave soil moisture data for monitoring live fuel
   moisture content (LFMC) over the coterminous United States},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {771},
Month = {JUN 1},
Abstract = {Live fuel moisture content (LFMC), which is the ratio of water in the
   fresh biomass to the dry biomass, is a key variable that affects
   wildfire behaviour. Previous studies have assessed soil moisture as a
   predictor of LFMC over small areas with limited data, but a
   comprehensive evaluation at sub-continental scale is still lacking, and
   the explanatory utility has not been evaluated under different aridity
   conditions. In this study, the utility was evaluated using microwave
   soil moisture data from the ESA ECV\_SM product from 1979 to 2018 and
   LFMC data from over 1000 sites in the coterminous United States. A
   time-lagged robust linear regression model was adopted, and the results
   were compared with analysis from in situ soil moisture measurements at
   adjacent sites. The results suggested that at most sites the LFMC
   correlates best with soil moisture within 60 days prior to LFMC
   sampling, and that the correlation is lower in areas with complex
   terrain. LFMC can be estimated from soil moisture with a mean RMSE of
   around 20\%. The correlation between LFMC and soil moisture is
   significant (p<0.01) in most regions, and is mostly stable in different
   years. The major fuel types with a high response to soil moisture
   include pine, redcedar, sagebrush, oak, manzanita, chamise, mesquite and
   juniper, depending on the region. The LFMC - soil moisture correlation
   varies with the aridity condition, and soil moisture has a higher
   explanatory utility on LFMC under dry conditions. An analysis using SMAP
   Level-4 product indicated that the surface and root-zone soil moisture
   perform similarly in LFMC estimation. This study suggests that microwave
   soil moisture data contain sufficient information on LFMC, and may serve
   as a reference for the development of more sophisticated LFMC estimation
   methods. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Deteriorating soil fertility, low unreliable rainfall and soil moisture
   stress has resulted to low crop yields among farmers of sub-Saharan
   Africa (SSA), necessitating a search for more sustainable production
   practices. Zai technology has the ability to promote soil moisture
   retention and enhances soil fertility. A four-seasons field experiment
   was conducted to assess the impact of Zai technology combined with
   cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer on selected soil properties and
   sorghum yields in Kabati, Kitui County. The experiment was set up in a
   Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with eight treatments replicated
   thrice with sorghum Gadam as the test crop. Soil sampling was done at
   the beginning of the first season and at the end of the fourth season at
   a dept of 0-15 cm across each plot for laboratory analyses. From the
   results, the increase in electrical conductivity was significant at p <
   0.05 in all the treatments after four cropping seasons. Total organic
   carbon significantly increased in Zai with cattle manure (p = 0.045),
   conventional with no input (p = 0.038) and conventional with cattle
   manure (p = 0.045). Available phosphorous significantly (p < 0.05)
   increased in treatments under Zai technology while total nitrogen
   significantly (p < 0.05) reduced after the four cropping seasons. There
   was a significant (p < 0.05) interactive effect of the tested factors on
   soil pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and available
   phosphorous at the end of the experiment. Moreover, there was
   significant (p < 0.05) interactive effects on grain yields (SR18 and
   SR19 seasons) and stover yields (SR18, LR19, and SR19 seasons), with
   higher yields being recorded in treatments under Zai technology. This
   study demonstrates the importance of Zai technology in increasing crop
   yield by trapping water and enhancing its retention and infiltration
   into the soil for uptake by plants. This study concluded that positive
   impacts on important soil properties and crop yield could be realized
   when Zai technology is utilized alongside either sole inorganics or a
   combination of organic and inorganic amendments and this could be used
   as a strategy to improve crop production in eastern Kenya and other
   similar areas.},

Abstract = {High-input, modern rice farming (MRF) has caused severe soil degradation
   worldwide, necessitating a transition towards more sustainable
   practices. The traditional rice-fish coculture (RFC) and manure
   fertilization (Manure) may provide valuable insights to this transition.
   However, it remains elusive how long-term agricultural conversion
   influences microbial community structure, soil fertility, and food
   supply. Here, we performed six-year conversions of MRF to either RFC or
   Manure in a hilly area of Sichuan (China). We found that agricultural
   conversions exerted a greater impact than rice growing stages on
   bacterial community structure. The RFC bacterial network exhibited the
   highest modularity and robustness, but also harbored the most diverse
   keystone taxa, followed by Manure. In contrast, MRF displayed network
   properties that are characteristic of unstable communities. Importantly,
   RFC also exhibited the greatest capability in improving the preservation
   of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and has significantly
   increased soil pH (> 1.5 units). Yet, adopting traditional practices,
   particularly Manure, decreased rice yields, but fish harvested in RFC
   could offset the decrease in rice yield. Our field study highlights
   bacterial network structure and keystone taxa diversity as possible
   indicators for agriculture sustainability, but also incentivizes the
   integration of traditional RFC in developing novel sustainable
   agricultural practices.},

Abstract = {Monitoring nitrogen utilization efficiency and soil temperature in
   agricultural systems for timely intervention is essential for crop
   health with reduced environmental pollution. Herein, this work presents
   a high-performance multi-parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide
   (VOX)-doped laser-induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple
   nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. The highly porous 3D VOX-doped
   LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium
   sulfide (V5S8)-doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self-assembled
   films. The heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the
   sensor with enhanced response to NOX and an ultralow limit of detection
   of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The
   sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast response/recovery,
   good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can
   accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10-110 degrees
   C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows
   for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX. The
   unencapsulated sensor operated at elevated temperature removes the
   influences of relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate
   NOX measurements. The capability to decouple nitrogen loss and soil
   temperature paves the way for the development of future multimodal
   decoupled electronics for precision agriculture and health monitoring.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the land surface model-simulated soil moisture (SM)
   product from the China Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS). This was
   achieved using three densely instrumented in situ observation networks
   in China that have different environmental conditions, i.e., the Hebi,
   Naqu and Heihe sites. The European Space Agency Climate Change
   Initiative multi-satellite-retrieved SM product (CCI-SM) was also
   included for inter-comparison purposes. Standard validation scores
   indicated that the CLDAS-SM product has high correlation and low
   uncertainty with both surface and root-zone soil moisture observations.
   The target accuracy (0.04 m(3)m(-3)) was achieved over all three sites.
   Compared with the CCI-SM product, the CLDAS-SM product showed higher
   accuracy for the Hebi and Heihe sites but slightly lower accuracy for
   the Naqu site located at the centre of the Tibetan Plateau. Regionally,
   the unbiased root mean square difference between the CLDAS-SM and CCI-SM
   products was noticeably smaller within China than in neighbouring
   countries. Given that the performance of the CCI-SM product should be
   unaffected by country boundaries, the better performance of the CLDAS-SM
   product in China can be attributed primarily to the high-quality
   meteorological forcing data.},

   using pressure plate and soil cores, respectively.
   The below theta(Dep) results for the surface soil suggests the need to

Title = {A dendroecological method to examine summertime soil-moisture changes: a

Abstract = {Key message Use of co-occurring species with varying temporal
   sensitivities to summer soil moisture may be used as a diagnostic to
   determine summertime drought intensification or amelioration. The use of
   tree-ring data from co-occurring species with different summertime
   soil-moisture responses provides an opportunity to evaluate the
   occurrence and direction of soil-moisture changes. Here, we present a
   method that compares adjusted latewood growth between longleaf pine
   (Pinuspalustris Mill.) and chestnut oak (Quercusprinus L.) from 1969 to
   2018 in the Uwharrie Mountains of central North Carolina, USA. We found
   that adjusted latewood sensitivity to soil moisture varied between
   species with the strongest response in September PDSI for longleaf pine
   (r = 0.47), and July PDSI for chestnut oak (r = 0.61). Large (> 0.20 or
   < - 0.20) radial growth differences between species occurred during 22
   years of the 50-year study period and were strongly correlated with PDSI
   differences (r = 0.74, p < 0.001), while the correlation with the whole
   dataset (r = 0.34, p < 0.05) was less sensitive. Major growth difference
   years were predominately negative (n = 17), suggesting that this method
   is more effective at detecting summers with decreasing soil moisture
   between mid and late summer. Overall, these results indicate that a
   differential response between species with dissimilar latewood formation
   periods may provide a means to examine potential intermonthly changes in
   summertime soil-moisture conditions as opposed to a single proxy value
   (e.g., anomalously dry, or wet) characterizing the entire summer.},

Title = {A Neural-Network Based Spatial Resolution Downscaling Method for Soil
   Moisture: Case Study of Qinghai Province},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {8},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Currently, soil-moisture data extracted from microwave data suffer from
   poor spatial resolution. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a
   method to downscale the soil moisture spatial resolution. The proposed
   method establishes a statistical relationship between
   low-spatial-resolution input data and soil-moisture data from a
   land-surface model based on a neural network (NN). This statistical
   relationship is then applied to high-spatial-resolution input data to
   obtain high-spatial-resolution soil-moisture data. The input data
   include passive microwave data (SMAP, AMSR2), active microwave data
   (ASCAT), MODIS data, and terrain data. The target soil moisture data
   were collected from CLDAS dataset. The results show that the addition of
   data such as the land-surface temperature (LST), the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized shortwave-infrared
   difference bare soil moisture indices (NSDSI), the digital elevation
   model (DEM), and calculated slope data (SLOPE) to active and passive
   microwave data improves the retrieval accuracy of the model. Taking the
   CLDAS soil moisture data as a benchmark, the spatial correlation
   increases from 0.597 to 0.669, the temporal correlation increases from
   0.401 to 0.475, the root mean square error decreases from 0.051 to
   0.046, and the mean absolute error decreases from 0.041 to 0.036. Triple
   collocation was applied in the form of {[}NN, FY3C, GEOS-5] based on the
   extracted retrieved soil-moisture data to obtain the error variance and
   correlation coefficient between each product and the actual
   soil-moisture data. Therefore, we conclude that NN data, which have the
   lowest error variance (0.00003) and the highest correlation coefficient
   (0.811), are the most applicable to Qinghai Province. The
   high-spatial-resolution data obtained from the NN, CLDAS data, SMAP
   data, and AMSR2 data were correlated with the ground-station data
   respectively, and the result of better NN data quality was obtained.
   This analysis demonstrates that the NN-based method is a promising
   approach for obtaining high-spatial-resolution soil-moisture data.},

Abstract = {Irrigation scheduling plays a pivotal role in water management.
   Conventional irrigation methods often struggle to maintain consistent
   moisture across fields due to uniform water application irrespective of
   field conditions and soil moisture levels. Automatic soil moisture
   sensors offer a solution by tailoring irrigation based on field
   conditions. These systems trigger irrigation when soil is too dry or
   skip it when moisture levels are sufficient. Hence, setting the right
   threshold value is key for sensor -based irrigation. This study involved
   laboratory testing of an irrigation controller, and determining soil
   matric potential and volumetric water content at various thresholds (1
   to 9) for Fargo Silty Clay soil. Subsequently, a field experiment
   assessed its performance for a drip irrigation system at different
   thresholds (5, 6, 7, and 8) for watermelon cultivation, both with and
   without clear plastic mulch, in a randomized layout. Thresholds 5, 6, 7,
   and 8 (-35, -45, -55, and -70 kPa), along with no irrigation, were
   considered with one irrigation event daily. Results from laboratory and
   field tests underscore the controller's efficacy in managing drip
   irrigation timing and duration. Notably, threshold 7 (-55 kPa) combined
   with clear plastic mulch emerged as the most optimal treatment, yielding
   the highest watermelon production of 129.6 tons/ha. Moreover, this
   approach delivered premium produce quality, but utilizing only 142.2 mm
   of irrigation water. This study emphasizes the role of precise
   irrigation scheduling. By integrating smart technology and thoughtful
   threshold setting, agricultural practices can be elevated, yielding
   abundant crops while conserving water and promoting sustainability.},

Title = {A Novel Method for Long Time Series Passive Microwave Soil Moisture
   Downscaling over Central Tibet Plateau},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The coarse scale of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) is not
   suitable for regional agricultural and hydrological applications such as
   drought monitoring and irrigation management. The optical/thermal
   infrared (OTI) data-based passive microwave SSM downscaling method can
   effectively improve its spatial resolution to fine scale for regional
   applications. However, the estimation capability of SSM with long time
   series is limited by OTI data, which are heavily polluted by clouds. To
   reduce the dependence of the method on OTI data, an SSM retrieval and
   spatio-temporal fusion model (SMRFM) is proposed in the study.
   Specifically, a model coupling in situ data, MODerate-resolution Imaging
   Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) OTI data, and topographic information is
   developed to retrieve MODIS SSM (1 km) using the least squares method.
   Then the retrieved MODIS SSM and the spatio-temporal fusion model are
   employed to downscale the passive microwave SSM from coarse scale to 1
   km. The proposed SMRFM is implemented in a grassland dominated area over
   Naqu, central Tibet Plateau, for Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer-Earth Observing System sensor (AMSR-E) SSM downscaling in
   unfrozen period. The in situ SSM and Noah land surface model 0.01
   degrees SSM are used to validate the estimated MODIS SSM with long time
   series. The evaluations show that the estimated MODIS SSM has the same
   temporal resolution with AMSR-E and obtains significantly improved
   detailed spatial information. Moreover, the temporal accuracy of
   estimated MODIS SSM against in situ data (r = 0.673, mu bRMSE = 0.070
   m(3)/m(3)) is better than the AMSR-E (r = 0.661, mu bRMSE = 0.111
   m(3)/m(3)). In addition, the temporal r of estimated MODIS SSM is
   obviously higher than that of Noah data. Therefore, this suggests that
   the SMRFM can be used to estimate MODIS SSM with long time series by
   AMSR-E SSM downscaling in the study. Overall, the study can provide help
   for the development and application of microwave SSM-related scientific
   research at the regional scale.},

Title = {A New Method for Estimating Soil Fertility Using Extreme Gradient
   Boosting and a Backpropagation Neural Network},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil fertility affects crop yield and quality. A quick, accurate
   evaluation of soil fertility is crucial for agricultural production. Few
   satellite image-based evaluation studies have quantified soil fertility
   during the crop growth period. Therefore, this study proposes a new
   approach to the quantitative evaluation of soil fertility. Firstly, the
   optimal crop spectral variables were selected using the integration of
   an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with variance inflation
   factor (VIF). Then, based on the optimal crop spectral variables where
   the red-edge indices were introduced for the first time, the estimation
   models were developed using the backpropagation neural network (BPNN)
   algorithm to assess soil fertility. The model was finally adopted to map
   the soil fertility using Sentinel-2 imagery. This study was performed in
   the Conghua District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. The
   results of our research are as follows: (1) five crop spectral variables
   (inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI), chlorophyll vegetation
   index (CVI), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), red-edge
   position (REP), and triangular greenness index (TGI)) were the optimal
   variables. (2) The BPNN model established with optimal variables
   provided reliable estimates of soil fertility, with the determination
   coefficient (R-2) of 0.66 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17. A
   nonlinear relation was found between soil fertility and the optimal crop
   spectral variables. (3) The BPNN model provides the potential for soil
   fertility mapping using Sentinel-2 images, with an R-2 of 0.62 and an
   RMSE of 0.09 for the measured and estimated results. This study suggests
   that the proposed method is suitable for the estimation of soil
   fertility in paddy fields.},

Journal = {SCIENCE CHINA-EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {63},
Number = {4},
Pages = {591-601},

Abstract = {The high soil organic carbon (SOC) content in alpine meadow can
   significantly change soil hydrothermal properties and further affect the
   soil temperature and moisture as well as the surface water and energy
   budget. Therefore, this study first introduces a parameterization scheme
   to describe the effect of SOC content on soil hydraulic and thermal
   parameters in a land surface model (LSM), and then the SOC content is
   estimated by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated
   surface-layer soil moisture. The accuracy of the estimated SOC content
   was evaluated using in situ observation data at a soil moisture and
   temperature-measuring network in Naqu, central Tibetan Plateau.
   Sensitivity experiments show that the optimum time window for
   stabilizing the estimation results cannot be shorter than three years.
   In the experimental area, the estimated SOC content can generally
   reflect the spatial distribution of the measurements, with a root mean
   square error of 0.099 m(3) m(-3), a mean bias of 0.043 m(3) m(-3), and a
   correlation coefficient of 0.695. The estimated SOC content is not
   sensitive to the temporal frequency of the soil moisture data input.
   Even if the temporal frequency is as low as that of current soil
   moisture products derived from passive microwave satellites, the
   estimation result is still stable. Therefore, by combining a
   high-quality satellite soil moisture product and a parameter
   optimization method, it is possible to obtain grid-scale effective
   parameter values, such as SOC content, for an LSM and improve the
   simulation ability of the LSM.},

Abstract = {The ongoing global industrialization along with the notable world
   population growth is projected to challenge the global environment as
   well as pose greater pressure on water and food needs. Foreseeably, an
   improved irrigation management system is essential and the quest for
   refined chemical sensors for soil-moisture monitoring is of tremendous
   importance. Nevertheless, the persisting challenge is to design and
   construct stable materials with the requisite sensitivity, selectivity,
   and high performance. Here, we report the introduction of porous
   metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the receptor layer, in capacitive
   sensors to efficiently sense moisture in two types of soil. Namely, our
   study unveiled that Cr-soc-MOF-1 offers the best sensitivity
   (approximate to 24,000 pF) among the other tested MOFs for any given
   range of soil moisture content, outperforming several well-known oxide
   materials. The corresponding increase in the sensitivities for tested
   MOFs at 500 Hz are approximate to 450, approximate to 200, and
   approximate to 30\% for Cr-soc-MOF-1, Al-ABTC-soc-MOF, and
   Zr-fum-fcu-MOF, respectively. Markedly, Cr-soc-MOF-1, with its
   well-known water capacity, manifests an excellent sensitivity of
   approximate to 450\% in clayey soil, and the analogous response time was
   500 s. The noted unique sensing properties of Cr-soc-MOF-1 unveils the
   great potential of MOFs for soil-moisture sensing application.},

Title = {A dynamic data-driven method for dealing with model structural error in
   soil moisture data assimilation},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {132},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Attributing to the flexibility in considering various types of
   observation error and model error, data assimilation has been
   increasingly applied to dynamically improve soil moisture modeling in
   many hydrological practices. However, accurate characterization of model
   error, especially the part caused by defective model structure, presents
   a significant challenge to the successful implementation of data
   assimilation. Model structural error has received limited attention
   relative to parameter and input errors, mainly due to our poor
   understanding of structural inadequacy and the difficulties in
   parameterizing structural error. In this paper, we present a dynamic
   data-driven approach to estimate the model structural error in soil
   moisture data assimilation without the need for identifying error
   generation mechanism or specifying particular form for the error model.
   The error model is based on the Gaussian process regression and then
   integrated into the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to form a hybrid
   method for dealing with multi-source model errors. Two variants of the
   hybrid method in terms of two different error correction manners are
   proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested through a
   suit of synthetic cases and a real-world case. Results demonstrate the
   potential of the proposed hybrid method for estimating model structural
   error and providing improved model predictions. Compared to the
   traditional EnKF without explicitly considering the model structural
   error, parameter compensation issue is obviously reduced and soil
   moisture retrieval is substantially improved.},

Title = {Estimating evapotranspiration from soil moisture using the improved soil
   water balance method in cold mountainous areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY X},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for ecosystem protection and water
   services, especially in the mountainous areas of arid and semi-arid
   watersheds. The lysimeter and Eddy Covariance (EC) methods are widely
   used for directly measuring ET, but are difficult to install and apply
   in mountainous areas with complex topography. The commonly used indirect
   methods for estimating ET, such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) method,
   present significant challenges in mountainous areas with scarce data.
   The simple soil water balance (SWB) method, which estimates ET from soil
   moisture dynamics, is another reliable and simple method for estimating
   ET. However, a drawback of the original SWB method is that it assumes
   soil moisture depletion only occurs through ET, ignoring the process of
   deep percolation. This restriction limits the applicability of the SWB
   method. In this study, we improve the SWB method (ISWB) by incorporating
   a deep percolation module into the soil water balance equation.
   Subsequently, we compare the estimated ET obtained from the ISWB, the
   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-56 PM, and the Hargreaves-Samani
   (HS) methods with the observed ET. Results show that the ISWB method for
   estimating ET performs better when using the soil moisture of the 0-25
   cm and below layers, compared to the 0-20 cm and above layers.
   Meanwhile, there is no significant difference in performance between
   using the soil moisture of the 0-25 cm layer and the soil layers below
   25 cm. In addition, ignoring interception evaporation has an obvious
   influence on ET estimation using the ISWB. Furthermore, the comparison
   indicated that the performance of the ISWB method is superior to that of
   the FAO-56 PM and HS methods in the study areas. Our study shows that
   the ISWB method has significant potential for ET estimation in
   data-scarce and topographic-complex mountainous areas.},

Title = {Flood Forecasting via the Ensemble Kalman Filter Method Using Merged
   Satellite and Measured Soil Moisture Data},
Journal = {WATER},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Flood monitoring in the Chaohe River Basin is crucial for the timely and
   accurate forecasting of flood flow. Hydrological models used for the
   simulation of hydrological processes are affected by soil moisture (SM)
   data and uncertain model parameters. Hence, in this study, measured
   satellite-based SM data obtained from different spatial scales were
   merged, and the model state and parameters were updated in real time via
   the data assimilation method named ensemble Kalman filter. Four
   different assimilation settings were used for the forecasting of
   different floods at three hydrological stations in the Chaohe River
   Basin: flood forecasting without data assimilation (NA case),
   assimilation of runoff data (AF case), assimilation of runoff and
   satellite-based soil moisture data (AFWR case), and assimilation of
   runoff and merged soil moisture data (AFWM case). Compared with NA, the
   relative error (RE) of small, medium, and large floods decreased from
   0.53 to 0.23, 0.35 to 0.16, and 0.34 to 0.12 in the AF case,
   respectively, indicating that the runoff prediction was significantly
   improved by the assimilation of runoff data. In the AFWR and AFWM cases,
   the REs of the small, medium, and large floods also decreased,
   indicating that the soil moisture data play important roles in the
   assimilation of medium and small floods. To study the factors affecting
   the assimilation, the changes in the parameter mean and variance and the
   number of set samples were analyzed. Our results have important
   implications for the prediction of different levels of floods and
   related assimilation processes.},

Title = {An Improved SCS-CN Method Incorporating Slope, Soil Moisture, and Storm
   Duration Factors for Runoff Prediction},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) is a popular surface
   runoff prediction method because it is simple in principle, convenient
   in application, and easy to accept. However, the method still has
   several limitations, such as lack of a land slope factor, discounting
   the storm duration, and the absence of guidance on antecedent moisture
   conditions. In this study, an equation was developed to improve the
   SCS-CN method by combining the CN value with the tabulated CN2 value and
   three introduced factors (slope gradient, soil moisture, and storm
   duration). The proposed method was tested for calibration and validation
   with a dataset from three runoff plots in a watershed of the Loess
   Plateau. The results showed the model efficiencies of the proposed
   method were improved to 80.58\% and 80.44\% during the calibration and
   validation period, respectively, which was better than the standard
   SCS-CN and the other two modified SCS-CN methods where only a single
   factor of soil moisture or slope gradient was considered, respectively.
   Using the parameters calibrated and validated by dataset of the initial
   three runoff plots, the proposed method was then applied to runoff
   estimation of the remaining three runoff plots in another watershed. The
   proposed method reduced the root-mean-square error between the observed
   and estimated runoff values from 5.53 to 2.01 mm. Furthermore, the
   parameters of soil moisture (b(1) and b(2)) is the most sensitive,
   followed by parameters in storm duration (c) and slope equations (a(1)
   and a(2)), and the least sensitive parameter is the initial abstraction
   ratio lambda on the basis of the proposed method sensitivity analysis.
   Conclusions can be drawn from the above results that the proposed method
   incorporating the three factors in the SCS method may estimate runoff
   more accurately in the Loess Plateau of China.},

   Method: Performance and Validation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL 2},
Abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-reflectometry is a type of
   remote sensing technology and can be applied to soil moisture retrieval.
   Until now, various GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval methods have been
   reported. However, there still exist some problems due to the complexity
   of modeling and retrieval process, as well as the extreme uncertainty of
   the experimental environment and equipment. To investigate the behavior
   of bistatic GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval process, two ground-truth
   measurements with different soil conditions were carried out and the
   performance of the input variables was analyzed from the mathematical
   statistical aspect. Moreover, the feature of XGBoost method was utilized
   as well. As a recently developed ensemble machine learning method, the
   XGBoost method just emerged for the classification of remote sensing and
   geographic data, to investigate the characterization of the input
   variables in the GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. It showed a good
   correlation with the statistical analysis of ground-truth measurements.
   The variable contributions for the input data can also be seen and
   evaluated. The study of the paper provides some experimental insights
   into the behavior of the GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. It is
   worthwhile before establishing models and can also help with
   understanding the underlying GNSS-R phenomena and interpreting data.},

Title = {Spatial Heterogeneity and Driving Factors of Soil Moisture in Alpine
   Desert Using the Geographical Detector Method},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is a vital factor affecting the hydrological cycle and the
   evolution of soil and geomorphology, determining the formation and
   development of the vegetation ecosystem. The previous studies mainly
   focused on the effects of different land use patterns and vegetation
   types on soil hydrological changes worldwide. However, the spatial
   heterogeneity and driving factors of soil gravimetric water content in
   alpine regions are seldom studied. On the basis of soil sample
   collection, combined with geostatistical analysis and the geographical
   detector method, this study examines the spatial heterogeneity and
   driving factors of soil gravimetric water content in the typical alpine
   valley desert of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results show that the
   average value of soil gravimetric water content at different depths
   ranges from 3.68\% to 7.84\%. The optimal theoretical models of soil
   gravimetric water content in 0-50 cm layers of the dune are different.
   The nugget coefficient shows that the soil gravimetric water content in
   the dune has a strong spatial correlation at different depths, and the
   range of the optimal theoretical model of semi-variance function is
   31.23-63.38 m, which is much larger than the 15 m spacing used for
   sampling. The ranking of the influence of each evaluation factor on the
   alpine dune is elevation > slope > location > vegetation > aspect. The
   interaction detection of factors indicates that an interaction exists
   among evaluation factors, and no factors are independent of one another.
   In each soil layer of 0-50 cm, the interaction among evaluation factors
   has a two-factor enhancement and a nonlinear enhancement effect on soil
   gravimetric water content. This study contributes to the understanding
   of spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil moisture in alpine
   deserts, and guidance of artificial vegetation restoration and soil
   structure analysis of different desert types in alpine cold desert
   regions.},

Title = {An effective method of magnetic field treatment in increasing soil
   phosphorus availability in wheat rhizosphere},
Journal = {RHIZOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Magnetic fields are widely used as a physical energy source in industry
   and environmental governance. Their application in agriculture has also
   been reported; however, it remains unknown whether magnetic fields can
   be used to increase the availability of phosphorus in wheat fields and
   whether they have an effect on increasing phosphorus availability in the
   rhizosphere. In this study, we conducted an incubation experiment for
   soil and a field control experiment for wheat cultivation. In the wheat
   cultivation experiment, four magnetic field intensity treatments of 20,
   40, 60, and 80 mT were set with 0 mT as a control (CK). Under the
   magnetic field intensity of 60 mT, the available phosphorus content
   increased by 7.06\% at the booting stage, and acid phosphatase and
   alkaline phosphatase activities in rhizosphere soil increased by 19.89\%
   and 9.26\%, respectively, under 40 mT and by 12.16\% and 26.70\%,
   respectively, under 60 mT magnetic field intensities compared with CK.
   Moreover, compared with CK, the magnetic field mainly affected lipids
   and lipid-like molecules, organic oxygen compounds, phenylpropanoids,
   and polyketides in the rhizosphere metabolisms. The results of
   correlation analysis show that the abundance of rhizosphere metabolites
   was significantly correlated with the acid phosphatase activity, and the
   acid phosphatase activity was significantly correlated with the
   available phosphorus content. The results indicate that applying an
   appropriate magnetic field intensity to soil altered the abundance of
   wheat rhizosphere metabolites. Furthermore, the activity of phosphatase
   and the content of available phosphorus in the soil increased, which
   resulted in increased available phosphorus uptake by wheat plants. This
   study highlights that magnetic fields can be used as a means to increase
   phosphorus availability in soil.},

Title = {A Bayesian machine learning method to explain the error characteristics
   of global-scale soil moisture products},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {296},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Estimating accurate surface soil moisture (SM) dynamics from space, and
   knowing the error characteristics of these estimates, is of great
   importance for the application of satellite-based SM data throughout
   many Earth Science/Environmental Engineering disciplines. Here, we
   introduce the Bayesian inference approach to analyze the error
   characteristics of widely used passive and active microwave
   satellite-derived SM data sets, at different overpass times, acquired
   from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean
   Salinity (SMOS), and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) missions. In
   particular, we apply Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) and triple
   collocation analysis (TCA) to investigate the relative importance of
   different environmental factors and human activities on the accuracy of
   satellite-based data.To start, we compare the BHM-based sensitivity
   analysis method to the classic multiple regression models using a
   frequentist approach, which includes complete pooling and no-pooling
   models that have been widely used for sensitivity analysis in the field
   of remote sensing and demonstrate the BHM's adaptability and great
   potential for providing insight into sensitivity analysis that can be
   used by various remote sensing research communities.Next, we conduct an
   uncertainty analysis on BHM's model parameters using a full range of
   uncertainties to assess the association of various environmental factors
   with the accuracy of satellite-derived SM data. We focus on
   investigating human-induced error sources such as disturbed surface soil
   layers caused by irrigation activities on microwave satellite systems,
   naturally introduced error sources such as vegetation and soil organic
   matter, and errors related to the disregard of SM retrieval algorithmic
   assumptions -such as the thermal equilibrium passive microwave systems.
   Based on the BHM-based sensitivity analysis, we find that assessments of
   SM data quality with a single variable should be avoided, since numerous
   other factors simultaneously influence their quality. As such, this
   provides a useful framework for applying Bayesian theory to the
   investigation of the error characteristics of satellite-based SM data
   and other time-varying geophysical variables.},

Title = {Fusing Active and Passive Remotely Sensed Soil Moisture Products Using
   an Improved Double Instrumental Variable Method},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {High-quality soil moisture (SM) is significant for hydrological,
   meteorological, and agricultural applications. At present, active and
   passive remote sensing are the only two ways to monitor SM directly at
   the regional scale. However, the quality of a single satellite-based SM
   product is insufficient to meet the requirements of these applications.
   Hence, fusing these two SM products to improve their quality of change
   capture ability and accuracy is a necessary and challenging work. This
   study proposes an improved double instrumental variable method to fuse
   active and passive SM products. First, the method is improved in finding
   the best instrumental variables in time series based on the correlation
   coefficient. Second, fused weights of input SM products are estimated
   using the improved method. Finally, fused SM products are obtained with
   higher change capture ability and higher accuracy. The Tibetan Plateau
   (TP) was selected as the study area to test the algorithm using both of
   the climate change initiative (CCI) active and passive SM products from
   the European Space Agency (ESA). The ground validation results show
   that, compared with the original SM products, the change capture
   ability, expressed by the correlation coefficient (R), and the accuracy,
   expressed by the unbiased root mean square deviation (ubRMSD), have both
   been improved by about 10\% on average. Compared with the original
   method, the R and ubRMSD have been improved by more than 30\% on
   average. This study indicates that the proposed fusion method can
   effectively improve the quality of SM products to further understand the
   global changing water cycle.},

Title = {A Two-Step Method to Calibrate CYGNSS-Derived Land Surface Reflectivity
   for Accurate Soil Moisture Estimations},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Abstract = {Based on a statistical analysis of the currently available 3-year
   on-orbit Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data
   (2017-2019), this study proposes a two-step calibration method to
   improve the accuracy of the CYGNSS-derived land surface reflectivity
   (SR) and the resulting soil moisture (SM) estimates. The method is
   designed for two purposes: the one is to correct the system errors of
   the SR estimates induced by the calibration of the CYGNSS Version 2.1
   L1B data, and the other is to eliminate vegetation attenuation in the SR
   of the soil layer. Mean SR corrections of similar to-0.9 and 2.2 dB are
   achieved through the first and second steps of calibration,
   respectively. This resulted in better SM estimates compared with the
   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) product and the in situ
   measurements, i.e., improved correlations between the CYGNSS SR and the
   SMAP SM (from R = 0.46 to R = 0.74), improved correlations between the
   CYGNSS SR and the in situ SM (from R = 0.47 to R = 0.62), and between
   the CYGNSS SM and the in situ SM with the best R = 0.64.},

Abstract = {In this paper, an all-solid-state nitrate doped polypyrrole (PPy(NO3-)
   ion-selective electrode (ISE) was prepared with a nanohybrid composite
   film of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) and electrochemically reduced
   graphene oxide (ERGO). Preliminary tests on the ISE based in-situ soil
   nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N) monitoring was conducted in a laboratory
   3-stage column. Comparisons were made between the NO3--N content of
   in-situ soil percolate solution and laboratory-prepared extract
   solution. Possible influential factors of sample depth, NO3--N content,
   soil texture, and moisture were varied. Field-emission scanning electron
   microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterized
   morphology and content information of the composite film of ERGO/AuNPs.
   Due to the performance excellence for conductivity, stability, and
   hydrophobicity, the ISE with ERGO/AuNPs illustrates an acceptable
   detection range from 10(-1) to 10(-5) M. The response time was
   determined to be about 10 s. The lifetime was 65 days, which revealed
   great potential for the implementation of the ERGO/AuNPs mediated ISE
   for in-situ NO3--N monitoring. In-situ NO3--N testing results conducted
   by the all-solid-state ISE followed a similar trend with the standard

Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Alternative grazing systems that incorporate cover crops may be useful
   to achieve a longer grazing season and maximize forage production.
   However, little is known about their impact on soil properties,
   especially in the presence or absence of cattle grazing in the early
   spring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interacting effects of
   cropping systems with and without cattle grazing in rotation with corn
   or soybean on the balance and dynamics of soil fertility and enzyme
   activity. This study was conducted as a system experiment between 2015
   and 2019 in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, USA. The experimental design was
   a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments
   included presence or absence of cattle grazing and two types of cropping
   systems (pasture-rye-soybean-pasture {[}P-R-SB-P] and
   pasture-wheat/vetch-corn-pasture {[}P-W/V-C-P]. Soil samples were
   collected six times during the study. Soil properties analyzed were soil
   pH, organic matter, salinity, K, Ca, Mg, cation exchange capacity (CEC),
   P, beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, aryl-sulfatase, fluorescein
   diacetate hydrolysis, ammonium, nitrate, permanganate oxidizable carbon
   (POXC), N\%, C\%, S\%, and C:N ratio. Grazing increased glucosidase
   activity, available Ca, Mg, NO3-, NH4+, soil pH, soil C\%, S\%, and the
   C:N ratio. In the P-W/V-C-P cropping system, soil pH, available Ca,
   NO3-, and sulfatase activity were found to increase compared with the
   P-R-SB-P cropping system. In contrast, soil OM, available K, Mg, CEC,
   glucosidase, phosphatase, POXC, and total C\%, N\%, and S\% were greater
   in the P-R-SB-P cropping system compared with the P-W/V-C-P cropping
   system. The results of this study suggested that rotational grazing can
   increase soil quality and microbial decomposition under the P-W/V-C-P
   cropping system, and that this result was greater than under the
   P-R-SB-P cropping system, leading to a faster nutrient cycling. These
   results show promise for producers who are seeking methods to diversify
   their farming operation and reduce the need for external inputs.},

Abstract = {Well-designed temperate tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems can
   enhance soil nutrient cycling compared to conventional agricultural
   systems. To improve the TBI designs and their subsequent wide-scale
   adoption, greater understanding is required regarding the extent to
   which widely-spaced tree rows and tree management practices influence
   spatio-temporal dynamics of soil nutrients. Our 2-year study (2021 and

   distances from tree rows (0, 4, 12, 20 m); the 10-year-old TBI system
   (50 trees ha-1) together with agricultural controls was established in
   southern Quebec (Canada). The TBI included hybrid poplars (Populus
   deltoides x P. nigra) planted alternately with high-value hardwoods in
   the rows. In each experimental block (n = 3), the TBI system and control
   were divided into two treatments: without root-pruning versus with (0.75
   m depth using a sub-soiler). In 2022, NO3- supply rates near tree rows
   (0 and 4 m; 0.28 +/- 0.04 {[}mean +/- SE] and 0.37 +/- 0.05 mu g cm-2
   d-1, respectively) were lower than alley centres (12 and 20 m) and
   controls (0.62 +/- 0.07, 0.52 +/- 0.07 and 0.82 +/- 0.07 mu g cm-2 d-1,
   respectively). A first structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis
   revealed that NO3- supply rates were mostly modulated by indirect
   effects of tree row distance and soil clay content through volumetric
   water content (VWC). Nitrate leaching (400-mm depth) at 0 and 4 m from
   the tree row was respectively 8.8 x and 7.5 x lower than that in the
   control. A second SEM analysis showed direct and indirect (through soil
   VWC affecting NO3- supply rates) effects of distance from tree rows on
   NO3- leaching rates. Within TBI, greater tree leaf litter dry-mass was
   trapped at 0 and 4 m versus 12 and 20 m. Phosphorus and K availability
   under tree rows was higher than all other distances within cultivated
   alleys and control plots. Phosphorus, K, Ca and Mg supplies within
   cultivated alleys were generally similar among distances (4, 12, and 20
   m) and did not differ from controls. An unexpected lack of effect of
   tree root pruning was observed regarding soil nutrient supply and N
   leaching. Clay content was a major driver of soil nutrient supply and N
   leaching. The role of TBI systems in determining soil nutrient dynamics
   depended upon the soil nutrient and sampling period that was measured,
   with greater effects beneath the trees and at the tree-crop interface.},

Abstract = {Accurate large-scale soil moisture (SM) retrievals using the daily NASA
   MERRA-2' climate reanalysis and ESA' Climate Change Initiative (CCI)
   remote sensing datasets are compromised by temporal and spatial
   ambiguities. To address this deficiency, we assess the accuracy of the
   above-mentioned datasets against the Soil Climate Analysis Network
   (SCAN) in-situ measurements at nine sites across the contiguous United
   States (CONUS) during 2014-2016. The sites are selected to represent
   different climate regions over the CONUS. SM dynamics from NASA MERRA-2
   and ESA CCI are compared with those of SCAN, and an SM dataset is
   developed based on a spatiotemporal analysis. Our results show that the
   NASA MERRA-2 and ESA CCI SM datasets have different accuracies at the
   nine SCAN sites in different seasons. The MERRA-2 and CCI SM datasets
   have the highest accuracy at sites with the lowest number of extreme
   events, indicating that both datasets cannot robustly capture extremum
   soil moisture values. The highest (lowest) agreement between the
   MERRA-2/CCI and SCAN SM data is observed in April (February) with the
   nine-site average unbiased root-mean-square-difference (ubRMSD) of
   0.0638 cm(3)/cm(3) (0.0914 cm(3)/cm(3)). In all the nine sites, the CCI
   SM data are more accurate than those of MERRA-2 in April-October. The
   CCI SM data shows greater accuracy in the sites with lower SM values
   and/or higher SM variability. MERRA-2 and CCI SM datasets show higher
   and lower accuracy at the sites with pasture and agricultural
   vegetation, respectively. Finally, a new SM dataset is created by using
   the more accurate SM data from MERRA-2 and CCI in each site and season.},

   detection of soil nutrient ions},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {The conventional techniques for soil nutrient ion detection face
   challenges, including prolonged preparation periods and the necessity
   for distinct instruments tailored to each specific ion. To address these
   issues, we have engineered a cutting-edge soil nutrient ion detection
   apparatus: the Microchip Electrophoresis Soil Nutrient Ion Portable
   Detection System (ME-SNI-PDS). This system, leveraging microchip
   electrophoresis with a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity
   detector (ME-C4D), simplifies the detection process with user-friendly
   touchscreen controls. Our system is capable of simultaneous detection of
   key soil nutrient ions-ammonium (NH4 +), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium
   (Mg2+), potassium (K+), nitrate (NO3 -), and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4
   -)-in a swift 180 s, facilitated by precise voltage regulation. We have
   refined the buffer solution, consisting of 20 mM
   2-(N-morpholinyl)-ethanesulfonic acid and L-histidine, with the addition
   of 0.01 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 10 mM 18-crown-6, to
   ensure the complete resolution of soil nutrient ions. Following this, we
   established highly accurate peak height-to-concentration correlations
   for the six aforementioned ions, each with a coefficient of
   determination (R2) exceeding 0.99. The detection limits for these ions
   stand at a remarkably low concentration of 0.05 mM, translating to 0.9
   mg l-1 for NH4 +, 2.0 mg l-1 for Ca2+, 1.2 mg l-1 for Mg2+, 1.96 mg l-1
   for K+, 3.1 mg l-1 for NO3 -, and 4.85 mg l-1 for H2PO4 -. Subsequent
   soil leachate analysis via the ME-SNI-PDS has yielded ion content data
   that, upon comparison with results from continuous flow analyser (CFA)
   and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, confirm the
   system's exceptional integration, compactness, portability, speed, and
   efficiency. The ME-SNI-PDS shows immense promise for application in
   precision agriculture and the prevention of surface soil pollution. It
   is poised to make a significant impact in the realm of crop
   fertilization and environmental stewardship.},

Abstract = {In West Sumatra, Indonesia, a high-yield perennial rice cropping method
   called SALIBU was recently reported, in which the most unique feature is
   double cutting (DC) at harvest and after harvest. The objective of this
   study was to verify the ratooning rice yield under the SALIBU system in
   Myanmar. Two cultivation trials consisting of two cutting and three
   moisture treatments were conducted in 2019 and 2020. We concluded that
   double cutting had no positive effect on grain yield and regeneration
   rate compared with single cutting (SC). For the cutting regime,
   significant results were detected in the ratoon crops on yield
   components, but all of these were negative effects of DC, and were
   statistically lower than those of SC. On the other hand, a significant
   positive effect of moisture regime on grain yield in all ratoons was
   observed. The grain yield of the dry regime was significantly increased
   by 69\% compared with that of the saturated regime. Soil oxidation
   conditions during the initial growth period of ratoons could contribute
   to the improved yield performance of the ratoons.},

Title = {Effects of Winter Snow Cover on Spring Soil Moisture Based on Remote
   Sensing Data Product over Farmland in Northeast China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Spring soil moisture (SM) is of great importance for monitoring
   agricultural drought and waterlogging in farmland areas. While winter
   snow cover has an important impact on spring SM, relatively little
   research has examined the correlation between winter snow cover and
   spring SM in great detail. To understand the effects of snow cover on SM
   over farmland, the relationship between winter snow cover parameters
   (maximum snow depth (MSD) and average snow depth (ASD)) and spring SM in
   Northeast China was examined based on 30 year passive microwave snow
   depth (SD) and SM remote-sensing products. Linear regression models
   based on winter snow cover were established to predict spring SM.
   Moreover, 4 year SD and SM data were applied to validate the performance
   of the linear regression models. Additionally, the effects of
   meteorological factors on spring SM also were analyzed using
   multiparameter linear regression models. Finally, as a specific
   application, the best-performing model was used to predict the
   probability of spring drought and waterlogging in farmland in Northeast
   China. Our results illustrated the positive effects of winter snow cover
   on spring SM. The average correlation coefficient (R) of winter snow
   cover and spring SM was above 0.5 (significant at a 95\% confidence
   level) over farmland. The performance of the relationship between snow
   cover and SM in April was better than that in May. Compared to the
   multiparameter linear regression models in terms of fitting coefficient,
   MSD can be used as an important snow parameter to predict spring drought
   and waterlogging probability in April. Specifically, if the relative SM
   threshold is 50\% when spring drought occurs in April, the prediction
   probability of the linear regression model concerning snow cover and
   spring SM can reach 74\%. This study improved our understanding of the
   effects of winter snow cover on spring SM and will be beneficial for
   further studies on the prediction of spring drought.},

Abstract = {Data assimilation provides a practical way to improve the accuracy of
   soil moisture simulation by integrating a land surface model and
   satellite data. This study establishes a multisource remote sensing data
   assimilation framework by incorporating a simultaneous state and
   parameter estimation method to acquire an accurate estimation of the
   soil moisture over the Tibetan Plateau. The brightness temperature of
   the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) is directly
   assimilated into the coupled system of the Common Land Model (CoLM) and
   a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) to improve the soilmoisture
   simulation. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   land surface temperature product and the Beijing Normal University (BNU)
   leaf area index product are employed to not only improve the estimation
   of temperature and vegetation variables from the CoLM, but they also
   provide more accurate background information for the RTM during the
   brightness temperature assimilation. In situ measurements from the Naqu
   network are used to evaluate the results. The model simulation showed an
   obvious underestimation of soil moisture and overestimation of soil
   temperature, which was alleviated by the assimilation experiments,
   particularly in the shallow soil layers. The estimated parameters also
   showed advantages in the soilmoisture simulation when compared with the
   default parameters. The assimilation experiment presents promising
   results in the combination of model and multisource remote sensing data

Abstract = {Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) normalized

   vegetation dynamics over different meteorological subdivisions in India
   for the period 2000-2016. Soil moisture (SM), rainfall (RF), and land

   significant greening trend over semi-arid regions of Northwest India
   (NWI) and South India (SI) while slight browning trend seen over some of
   the subdivisions in Indo-Gangetic (IG) plains and Western Ghats (WG). It
   is found that the NDVI has superior correlation with soil moisture
   compared with rainfall and the croplands (CL) found to have significant
   increasing trend over the NWI and SI. Increasing trend in soil moisture
   over the NWI and SI may have contributed to increase in CL area and the
   greening trend. Over IG plains, the NDVI showed moderate correlation
   with SM and RF, and the greening trend (browning trend) in some regions
   can be attributed to increase in natural vegetation mosaic (decrease of

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical parameter for land reclamation and
   ecological restoration in mining subsidence areas. However, limited
   research has been conducted into the impact of subsidence on soil
   moisture in semi-arid areas. In this study, the subsidence and soil
   moisture of four coal seams (4101 and 4102 coal seams are 2-year and
   1-year subsidence area, 4103 and 4104 coal seams are just after mining
   and ready for mining) in semi-arid region were monitored for a year. A
   soil moisture retrieval method suitable for semi-arid mining areas was
   improved. The results showed that the reduced Bias, MRE and RMSE
   difference between satellite and in situ soil moisture to 0.129, 0.0851
   and 0.0219, respectively, which demonstrated the reliability of the
   proposed soil moisture retrieval method in the semi-arid mining areas.
   We found that there was ecological self-restoration, the degree of
   spatial variability of soil moisture was gradually weaker with the
   increased subsidence time by comparing coal seams with different
   subsidence time. The average value of soil moisture in 4103 and 4104
   coal seams decreased by 0.20\% and 1.89\%, respectively, whereas the
   coefficient of variation increased by 13.99\% and 10.45\%, respectively.
   Window cross-correlation analysis shows underground mining activities
   have a lag effect. The mean time lag between subsidence and the soil
   moisture response varied 90 days after the subsidence occurred. But,
   about 120 days after the end of mining, soil moisture gradually
   recovers. All these results indicated repair of land cracks in time at
   subsidence edge can prevent the decline of soil moisture.},

Title = {A Performance Analysis of Soil Dielectric Models over Organic Soils in
   Alaska for Passive Microwave Remote Sensing of Soil Moisture},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture (SM) requires a
   physically based dielectric model that quantitatively converts the
   volumetric SM into the soil bulk dielectric constant. Mironov 2009 is
   the dielectric model used in the operational SM retrieval algorithms of
   the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the ESA Soil Moisture
   and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions. However, Mironov 2009 suffers a
   challenge in deriving SM over organic soils, as it does not account for
   the impact of soil organic matter (SOM) on the soil bulk dielectric
   constant. To this end, we presented a comparative performance analysis
   of nine advanced soil dielectric models over organic soil in Alaska,
   four of which incorporate SOM. In the framework of the SMAP
   single-channel algorithm at vertical polarization (SCA-V), SM retrievals
   from different dielectric models were derived using an iterative
   optimization scheme. The skills of the different dielectric models over
   organic soils were reflected by the performance of their respective SM
   retrievals, which was measured by four conventional statistical metrics,
   calculated by comparing satellite-based SM time series with in-situ
   benchmarks. Overall, SM retrievals of organic-soil-based dielectric
   models tended to overestimate, while those from mineral-soil-based
   models displayed dry biases. All the models showed comparable values of
   unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and Pearson Correlation (R),
   but Mironov 2019 exhibited a slight but consistent edge over the others.
   An integrated consideration of the model inputs, the physical basis, and
   the validated accuracy indicated that the separate use of Mironov 2009
   and Mironov 2019 in the SMAP SCA-V for mineral soils (SOM <15\%) and
   organic soils (SOM >= 15\%) would be the preferred option.},

Title = {Field scale soil water prediction based on areal soil moisture
   measurements using cosmic-ray neutron sensing in a karst landscape},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {605},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a newly-developed method for
   continuously measuring soil water content (SWC) at the hectometer
   horizontal scale. However, it is unknown whether CRNS-based SWC could be
   used for soil moisture prediction at field scale. In this study, we try
   to predict field scale SWC using the CRNS combined with the temporal
   stability analysis in a karst watershed. The CRNS was installed in a
   karst watershed as well as capacitance-based SWC sensors located in five
   land uses. The CRNS was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling
   procedures. A weather station was established about 200 m away from the
   CRNS for monitoring basic meteorological variables. The mean footprint
   radius and effective depth of the CRNS were 311.51 m and 11.98 cm,
   respectively. The CRNS can accurately estimate intermediate scale soil
   moisture, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89. Significant
   correlations (P < 0.01) were observed between SWC measured by the CRNS
   and Em-50 instruments. Though the SWC derived from the CRNS was
   significantly lower than that from Em-50 instruments in different land
   uses, the SWCs at field scale can be predicted accurately. The
   influences of landforms and land uses on prediction accuracy were not
   obvious from our data. The CRNS has great potential to improve water

Title = {Evaluating the soil hydraulic functions of vegetation restoration in a
   subtropical hilly catchment: Insights from continuous soil moisture
   monitoring},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {629},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The global trend of vegetation ``greening{''} in the context of
   ecological restoration necessitates an urgent assessment of ecosystem
   services. As essential components of ecosystem services, the hydraulic
   functions of soil in infiltrating and retaining water following
   vegetation restoration remain unclear, especially in subtropical
   mountainous and hilly areas with complex topographies. From 2018 to
   2021, soil moisture data collected at five-minute intervals were
   monitored for three restoration strategies in a hilly catchment of
   China's Three Gorges Reservoir area. The restoration strategies included
   planted forest (PF) and natural restoration (naturally regenerated
   forest, NF; deforested pasture, DP). The soil moisture response to
   rainfall under these strategies was evaluated using several metrics,
   including the time difference between peak rainfall intensity and peak
   soil moisture response (T-p2p), cumulative infiltration, and occurrence
   frequency of preferential flow (PRF). The results showed that the
   average soil moisture content (SMC) of PF was significantly (p < 0.05)
   lower than that of NF and DP in both dry and wet seasons, regardless of
   upslope or downslope location. However, the topographic position
   affected the difference in average SMC between DP and NF. At the
   downslope location, the average SMC of DP (0.39 cm(3) cm(-3)) was
   significantly higher than that of NF (0.33 cm(3) cm(-3)). Conversely, at
   the upslope location, the average SMC of DP (0.27 cm(3) cm(-3)) was
   lower than that of NF (0.30 cm(3) cm(-3)). These findings suggested that
   PF had a lower amount of soil water storage than NF and DP, which was
   supported by the lowest cumulative infiltration in PF during storm
   events. The response of soil moisture to storms in PF (T-p2p = 3.1 h)
   was slower than that in NF (T-p2p = 1.9 h) and DP (T-p2p = 2.5 h). This
   was consistent with the lower occurrence frequency of preferential flow
   in PF (PRF = 19.2 \%) than NF (PRF = 39.2 \%) and DP (PRF = 32.9 \%).
   Therefore, longer response time and less preferential flow indicated
   that the PF had a relatively poor soil moisture responsiveness to storm
   events. Accordingly, this study highlights the insufficiency of
   afforestation in soil water infiltration and retention compared to
   natural restoration, meriting consideration when assessing soil
   hydraulic functions in vegetation restoration areas.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) and soil freeze-thaw (FT) are two relatively active
   surface parameters that are significant to the sustainable development
   of the water-land-air-plant-human nexus. Over time, regional or global
   SM and FT datasets with different spatial resolutions have been
   developed. In response to the requirements of multiscale product
   validation and multisource uncertainty tracking, a soil moisture and
   soil temperature (ST) monitoring network in the Qinghai Lake Basin
   (QLB-NET) was established in September 2019. The QLB-NET is
   characterized by densely distributed in situ sites (82 sites) measuring
   SM and ST at 5-, 10-, and 30 -cm depths, with 60 sites in a large-scale
   network covering an area of 36 km x 40 km and 22 sites evenly
   distributed across two small-scale 1 km x 1 km networks. Quantitative
   analyses of the in situ measurements show that the QLB-NET can provide
   stable and reliable ground truth for SM and FT over coarse grid scales,
   e.g., 36 km x 36 km, 25 km x 25 km, and 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees.
   When statistics are correspondingly performed over 50 out of 54, 25 out
   of 29, and 25 out of 28 sites, the results are described as follows: 1)
   the standard deviation of the mean SM varies between 0.0127 and 0.0196
   m3 m-3, with the corresponding difference between the upper and lower
   quartiles being less than 0.02 m3 m-3; 2) the ground freeze-thaw state
   can be correctly identified with high probabilities ranging from 85.3\%
   to 100\% on two freeze-thaw transitional dates. The QLB-NET observed
   datasets are distributed online and will be continuously updated through
   cooperation with the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center
   (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn), facilitating product validation and
   uncertainty tracking, spatiotemporal analysis of SM change and FT
   transition, optimization of the SM and FT retrieving algorithms and
   scaling methods, and development of the mountainous microwave radiative
   transfer model.},

Abstract = {Land Surface Temperature and Fractional Vegetation Coverage (LST/FVC)
   space is a classical model in remote sensing of soil moisture (SM). Its
   most vital issue is the determination of the boundary i.e. dry and wet
   edges. Visual interpretation and automatic fitting methods are very
   demanding for the research area. In contrast, theoretical calculation of
   the boundary has great application potential, where the traditional
   Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation has been introduced to derive a Sun2016
   method. Recently, a new Priestly-Taylor equation was suggested. In order
   to furtherly improve the optical \& thermal remote sensing of SM, we
   evaluated the new PT equation for boundary determination through
   deriving a Sun 2021 method. The evaluation was conducted using data from
   three aircraft experiments for SM observation i.e. SMAPVEX12, SMAPVEX16
   in Iowa, and SMAPVEX16 in Manitoba. Simulated data with the Simsphere
   model was also used. Results demonstrated that the effects of the new PT
   equation are related to air temperature (Ta). For a certain range of Ta
   such as from 290K to 310K, the Sun 2021 method is close to the Sun2016
   method, which implies limited influence of the new PT equation within
   that range. For Ta out of that range, the Sun 2021 method presented
   better performance than the Sun2016, which implies stronger suitability
   of the new PT equation. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the new PT
   equation increases the sensitivity of calculated wet edge to Ta while
   decreases its sensitivity to the other input variables. For future
   extensive application, we also explored convenient ways for determining
   some essential parameters in the Sun 2021 method. The new PT equation
   has potential to promote the optical \& thermal remote sensing of SM,
   evapotranspiration, drought, etc.},

Title = {A General Paradigm for Retrieving Soil Moisture and Surface Temperature
   from Passive Microwave Remote Sensing Data Based on Artificial
   Intelligence},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) are entangled, and
   the retrieval of one of them requires a priori specification of the
   other one. Due to insufficient observational information, retrieval of
   LST and SM from passive microwave remote sensing data is often
   ill-posed, and the retrieval accuracy needs to be improved. In this
   study, a novel fully-coupled paradigm is developed to robustly retrieve
   SM and LST from passive microwave data, which integrates deep learning,
   physical methods, and statistical methods. The key condition of the
   general paradigm proposed by us is that the output parameters of deep
   learning can be uniquely determined by the input parameters
   theoretically through a certain mathematical equation. Firstly, the
   physical method is deduced based on the energy radiation balance
   equation. The nine unknowns require the brightness temperatures of nine
   channels to construct nine equations, and the solutions of the physical
   method equations are obtained by model simulation. Based on the
   derivation of the physical method, the solution of the statistical
   method is constructed using multi-source data. Secondly, the solutions
   of physical and statistical methods constitute the training and test
   data of deep learning, which is used to obtain the solution curve of
   physical and statistical methods. The retrieval accuracy of LST and SM
   is greatly improved by smartly utilizing the mutual prior knowledge of
   SM and LST and cross iterative optimization calculations. Finally,
   validation indicates that the mean absolute error of the retrieved SM
   and LST data are 0.027 m(3)/m(3) and 1.38 K, respectively, at an
   incidence angle of 0-65 degrees. A model-data-knowledge-driven and deep
   learning method can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and
   provide a paradigm for retrieval of other geophysical variables. The
   proposed paradigm not only has physical meaning, but also makes deep
   learning physically interpretable, which is a milestone in the retrieval
   of geophysical remote sensing parameters based on artificial
   intelligence technology.},

Title = {Detecting and mapping irrigated areas in a Mediterranean environment by
   using remote sensing soil moisture and a land surface model},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {596},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Although irrigation practices affect food production and water resource
   management, with ever more impacting effects under climate change and
   population increasing scenarios, detailed knowledge of irrigation is
   still lacking. In fact, explicit information on the spatial occurrence
   of irrigation and on the amounts of water used for this purpose is often
   not available, thus making irrigation the missing variable to
   comprehensively understand the hydrological cycle dynamics over
   agricultural areas. Nevertheless, remote sensing techniques can be used
   to delimit the irrigation extent.
   In this study, the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture
   products to detect the irrigation signal over an area intensely equipped
   for irrigation in the North East of Spain is investigated; moreover, a
   method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the K-means
   clustering algorithm is proposed. The remote sensing soil moisture data
   sets used in this study are SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) at 1
   km, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) at 1 km and 9 km, Sentinel-1 at
   1 km, and ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) at 12.5 km. The 1 km resolution
   versions of SMOS and SMAP are obtained by downscaling coarser SMOS and
   SMAP data through the DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And
   Theoretical scale CHange) algorithm. The analyses are supported by an
   additional data set of soil moisture at 1 km resolution simulated by the
   SURFEX-ISBA (SURFace EXternalisee - Interaction Sol Biosphere
   Atmosphere) land surface model.
   Among all the considered data sets, the L-band passive microwave
   downscaled products show the best performances in detecting the
   irrigation signal over the pilot area, especially SMAP at 1 km. The
   proposed maps of irrigated areas derived by exploiting soil moisture
   from SMAP at 1 km data set agree well (up to 78\%) with the ground truth
   derived irrigated areas. Furthermore, the method is able to well
   distinguish the actually irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural
   areas, thus representing a useful tool to obtain reliable spatial
   information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs.},

   Tibetan Plateau Based on the Random Forest Algorithm: Preliminary
   Results},
Journal = {EARTH AND SPACE SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an important index of soil drought, and it
   directly controls the energy balance and water cycle of the land
   surface. As an indicator and amplifier of global warming, the Tibetan
   Plateau (TP) is becoming warmer and wetter. Because of its particular
   geographical environment, large-scale measurements of SM on the TP can
   only be achieved by satellite remote sensing. The resolution of current
   SM product of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite is 36
   lcm, which is insufficient for many practical applications. In this
   study, the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and
   Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are applied to increase the resolution of
   SM down to 1 km using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. The preliminary
   results of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by station observations
   and other reanalysis products. The downscaled results are more
   consistent with the in situ observations, the Land Data Assimilation
   System (CLDAS) from China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and the
   Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) from National Aeronautics
   and Space Administration (NASA) than the original SMAP product. The
   downscaling algorithm is most effective for grasslands. It is
   demonstrated that high-resolution SM products can be generated by fusing
   various features using machine-learning algorithms.},

Title = {The Time Lag Effects and Interaction among Climate, Soil Moisture, and
   Vegetation from In Situ Monitoring Measurements across China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {12},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The interaction between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation dynamics has
   been proven in previous studies. In situ measurements have provided
   reliable data to investigate and validate the time effect in different
   zones, which is important in the hydrology and agriculture fields. There
   were 845 SM in situ monitoring measurements utilized with the
   correlation between SM and vegetation across various soil depths and
   climate zones in China. The impact of climate and teleconnection factors
   on SM and the leaf area index (LAI) are also discussed. The results
   indicate that SM increases from northwest to southeast in China. The
   time lag responses of SM to temperature, precipitation, relative
   humidity, and sunshine duration are 0-3 days, 3-7 days, 1-3 days, and
   3-15 days, respectively. The LAI is most strongly correlated with the
   climate of the current month. When the LAI leads SM, a negative
   correlation is observed, whereas a positive correlation is observed when
   SM leads the LAI. This proves that vegetation growth restricts the
   increase in SM, and soil drying further restricts the growth of
   vegetation. There was a response time of 2-4 months between the LAI and
   SM. The effect of vegetation and deeper SM was significant in the arid
   zone, while they were coupled with shallow SM in the humid zone.
   Additionally, the El Ni \& ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) showed a
   significant positive correlation with SM in 2015-2016 with signals of
   9-14 months. The results provide support for balancing the contradiction
   between future vegetation restoration and water resource scarcity.},

Abstract = {Crop water stress index (CWSI) has been widely used in soil moisture
   monitoring. However, the influence of the time lag effect between canopy
   temperature and air temperature on the accuracy of soil moisture
   monitoring with different CWSI models has not been further investigated.
   Therefore, based on the continuous record of canopy temperature and air
   temperature, this study explored the influence of canopy-air temperature
   hysteresis on the diagnosis of soil moisture with three CWSI models
   (CWSIT-theoretical, CWSIE-empirical, CWSIH-hybrid). The results show (1)
   the peak time of canopy temperature was ahead of that of air
   temperature, and the lag time varied under different soil moisture
   conditions. When the soil moisture was seriously deficient, the lag time
   decreased. However, from jointing-heading period to filling-ripening
   period, the lag time became longer. (2) The values of CWSIT, CWSIE, and
   CWSIH decreased when the time lag effect was considered. In
   jointing-heading period, heading-filling period, and filling-ripening
   period, CWSIT had the highest accuracy in soil moisture monitoring
   without the consideration of the time lag effect. When the time lag
   effect was considered, the monitoring accuracy of CWSIE and CWSIH was
   greatly improved and higher than that of CWSIT, while that of CWSIT was
   reduced. The findings provided a basis for further improving the
   accuracy of soil moisture monitoring with CWSI models.},

Abstract = {Wicking geotextile can reduce water contents in pavement layers under
   unsaturated conditions due to capillary action through grooves of
   wicking fibers. Reduction of soil water content under the pavement can
   minimize pavement distresses. So far, there have been limited use and
   verification of the wicking geotextile in reducing water content of soil
   under concrete pavements in the field. In this field study, moisture
   sensors were installed in three test sections under a newly-built
   concrete pavement during its re-construction. The base course in one
   test section had a higher percentage of small particles than those in
   other two sections. The wicking geotextile was used between the base
   course and the subgrade in two test sections while a nonwoven geotextile
   was used in one test section. All test sections were subjected to
   precipitations and temperature variations. Field monitoring data showed

   of an aggregate base more than the nonwoven geotextile and its wicking
   ability decreased as the content of small particles increased. In
   addition, the wicking ability of the wicking geotextile decreased as the
   temperature decreased due to the reduction in the evaporation rate and

Abstract = {Local community interest in better understanding regional climate change
   impacts has motivated the establishment of a long-term soil moisture and
   weather observation network in the Roaring Fork catchment of the
   Colorado River Headwaters. This catchment-wide suite of 10 stations,
   installed between 2012 and 2020, collects frequent, fixed-interval data
   on soil moisture, soil temperature, rain, air temperature, relative
   humidity, and (at some stations) snow across an elevational gradient
   from 1800 to 3680 m. In this paper we provide a description of the data
   this network provides, how data are accessed, and how this
   community-supported effort has resulted in data that support mountain
   hydrology research with applications for resource management and climate
   change adaptation decision making. All data from this network are

Title = {Characteristic bands extraction method and prediction of soil nutrient
   contents based on an analytic hierarchy process},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {220},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The selection of characteristic bands of soil nutrients is crucial for
   the prediction of soil nutrient contents. In this paper, a measurement
   method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and reflectance
   spectrum is proposed to realize the extraction of characteristic bands
   and the prediction of soil nutrients. Firstly, a series of alternative
   bands are obtained by mathematical transformations and correlation
   analysis from the reflectance spectral curves of 30 soil samples. Then,
   to objectively reflect different dependencies of spectral bands on the
   soil nutrients, AHP is adopted for weight analysis, and the particle
   swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) algorithm is used to correct the
   expert scoring matrix. Via the weight allocation, weight normalization
   and weight threshold, the alternative bands meeting the sum threshold of
   weights > 0.5 are finally selected as the characteristic bands of soil
   nutrients, which are at 484 nm, 512 nm, and 760 nm for total nitrogen
   (TN), and at 384 nm, 736 nm, and 748 nm for available phosphorus (AP).
   Finally, three inversion models established by the characteristic bands
   are used to predict soil nutrient contents, which demonstrated the
   feasibility of the analytic hierarchy process for the extraction of
   characteristic bands and the prediction of soil nutrients.},

Abstract = {There are multiple mechanisms by which enhanced diversity of plant
   communities improves soil structure and function. One critical pathway
   mediating this relationship is through changes to soil prokaryotic
   communities. Here, nine different cropping systems were studied to
   evaluate how legume and grass cover crops influence soil fertility and
   microbial communities in a maize-based no tillage system. The soil's
   bacterial and archaeal communities were sequenced (Illumina GAIIx, 12
   replicates for treatment) and correlated with eight different soil
   features. The microbial community composition differed widely between
   planting treatments, with three primary ``community types{''} emerging
   in multivariate space: (1) A community type associated with bare soil
   linked with low P, low pH, and high aluminum {[}Al]; (2) a community
   type associated with Lablab beans linked with high soil N, total organic
   carbon and other base cation concentrations, and high pH; and (3) a
   community type of all other non-lablab planting arrangements linked with
   higher soil P (relative to bare soil), but lower soil fertility (N and
   base cations). Lablab-based arrangements also expressed the highest
   microbial richness and alpha diversity. The inclusion of Lablab in
   maize-based cropping systems represents a potential alternative to
   reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and increase the chemical and
   biological quality in agricultural soils under the no-tillage system.},

Title = {Soil Moisture Estimation Based on GNSS-R Using L5 Signals From a
   Quasi-Zenith Satellite System},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Abstract = {Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) is a passive
   technique for remote sensing of soil moisture, which has continuous
   all-day and all-weather applicability on different platforms. New GNSS
   signals with advanced modulation and higher power are expected to
   improve the performance of GNSS-R. In this study, we performed a
   ground-based dual-antenna GNSS-R experiment on farmland and collected
   15-min raw intermediate frequency (IF) data with a central frequency of
   1175.42 MHz hourly over two different 24-h periods. The power ratio
   between the direct and reflected signals from quasi-zenith satellite
   system (QZSS) satellites was computed using a self-developed
   software-defined receiver with 1-ms coherent integration and 200-ms
   incoherent adds. Then, soil moisture was resolved using a semiempirical
   model based on power ratios. Solutions were evaluated using measurements
   obtained using a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probe. Results
   demonstrated that signal power-ratio-based QZSS signals can be used to
   retrieve soil moisture under bare soil conditions. Moreover, for signal
   power-ratio-based case, results from geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite
   signals (STD: 0.013 and 0.007 m(3)/m(3)) performed better than those
   from inclined geasynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellite signals (STD:

Title = {Assessing the sensitive spectral bands for soybean water status
   monitoring and soil moisture prediction using leaf-based hyperspectral
   reflectance},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {277},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {The stability of soybean yields in Brazil is regularly affected by
   drought periods, and soil management practices are crucial to expanding
   the water holding capacity of the soil and providing higher levels of
   moisture during critical periods, which contribute to increasing crop
   yields, relieving the need for non-agricultural areas to be converted
   into croplands. The research reported herein aimed to quantitatively
   monitor the soil moisture of a soybean crop through leaf-based
   hyperspectral reflectance and suggest a remote sensing-based approach
   that might assist in identifying soil management zones. A field
   experiment at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation during
   2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019 cropping seasons had ten soybean
   genotypes sub-jected to four water conditions: irrigated, non-irrigated,
   and water deficit induced at the vegetative or repro-ductive stages. The
   soil of the experimental site is characterized as Udox Oxisol. Leaf
   reflectance (400-2500 nm) was collected by the spectroradiometer
   FieldSpec 3 Jr simultaneously with soil moisture (0-20 and 20-40 cm
   depths) at eleven dates. Data submitted to Principal Component Analysis
   (PCA) evaluated the clustering of water conditions and which are the
   most critical spectral wavelengths to characterize the plant water
   status. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was applied to
   develop a quantitative spectral model to predict soil moisture. The PCA
   explained over 93\% of the spectral variance within each assessment day,
   and shortwave infrared wavelengths presented a higher contribution to
   water status clustering. At the cross-validation step, the PLSR
   presented R2 up to 0.860 and 0.906 (0-20 and 20-40 cm) underperforming
   when soil moisture showed no significant differences between water
   conditions. Using samples from all assessment days, PLSR presented R2 =
   0.609 and 0.722 (0-20 and 20-40 cm) at the external validation step
   (RMSE = 2.7 and 1.9, respectively), with a soil moisture range equal to
   16-35\% and 20-35\% at both depths, remarkably outperforming the
   traditional univariate spectral models. Our results contribute to soil
   moisture assessment in extensive soybean areas regardless of the stage
   of crop development and provide a significant contribution since the
   Brazilian soybean crop calendar might present differences of over 30
   days within the same production region. Due to that, soybean plants are
   rarely at the same phenological stage on a given date in the season.},

Abstract = {Timely acquisition of soil moisture content (SMC) in the root zone of
   field crops is crucial for achieving precise irrigation. In this study,
   high-spectral technology was employed to collect both SMC data at
   different soil depths during the bolting stage of winter oilseed rape
   (Brassica napus L.) and corresponding hyperspectral data through two
   consecutive years of field experiments (2021-2022). Two categories of
   spectral parameters were established, including ``three-edge{''}
   spectral parameters such as blue, yellow, and red edge areas, as well as
   empirical vegetation indices that showed strong correlations with
   previous research and crop parameters. The spectral parameters with the
   highest correlation coefficients with SMC at various soil depths were
   selected. Subsequently, the selected vegetation indices were utilized as
   inputs for modeling. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF),
   back propagation neural network (BPNN), and extreme learning machine
   (ELM) were employed to construct SMC estimation models for different
   soil depths during the jointing stage of winter oilseed rape. The
   results indicated that the majority of the three-edge parameters and
   empirical vegetation indices displayed higher correlation coefficients
   with SMC in the 0-20 cm soil depth compared to the 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm
   depths. The RF model proved to be the optimal modeling method for SMC
   estimation, particularly for the 0-20 cm soil depth. The validation set
   of the estimation model for this depth achieved a high coefficient of
   determination (R-2) of 0.944, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.005,
   and a mean relative error (MRE) of 3.074\%. The findings of this study
   provide a basis for high-spectral monitoring of SMC in the root zone of
   winter oilseed rape, offering valuable insights for the rapid assessment
   of crop growth under water stress conditions.},

Title = {Monitoring soil moisture at the catchment scale - A novel approach
   combining antecedent precipitation index and radar-derived rainfall data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {589},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Knowledge about soil moisture is important for event-based
   rainfall-runoff models but monitoring conditions at the catchment scale
   is not a trivial task. Soil moisture is highly variable in space and
   time, particularly in dry climates with seasonal and spatially
   heterogeneous rainfall. Point measurements are difficult to upscale, and
   remotely sensed (RS) data often lack in spatial or temporal resolution
   for local or regional studies. Longer latency periods - the time
   required before data becomes available - of some RS data make them less
   applicable to time-sensitive analyses such as flash flood forecasting.
   This study evaluated a novel approach for estimating catchment-scale
   volumetric soil moisture using an antecedent precipitation index (API)
   -based model. The model was trained and tested using in-situ soil
   moisture measurements collected during a 3-month field sampling campaign
   in a 142 km(2) study area in central New Mexico. The calibrated model
   was applied at the catchment scale to produce soil moisture grids from
   radar-derived rainfall estimates. Model performance, resolution and
   latency were compared to satellite-based soil moisture estimates.
   Benefits of the proposed new method include high spatial resolution (1 x
   1 km or less depending on the precipitation data source) and high
   prediction accuracy (root mean square errors 0.014-0.018 m(3)/m(3)).
   Given the short latency period for radar-derived rainfall data, the
   method has potential for use in operational flood risk assessment and
   forecasting.},

Abstract = {Information acquired from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) is frequently
   used nowadays in a variety of disciplines and research fields. The
   present study explores for the first time the combined use of UAVs with
   a newly proposed technique for estimating evaporative fraction (EF) and
   surface soil moisture (SSM). The investigation is performed in a typical
   Mediterranean setting, a citrus field with flat topography divided in
   two plots with different irrigation schemes, in Sicily, Italy, at which
   ground data acquired during an extensive field campaign in July 2019.
   Reasonable estimates of both EF and surface wetness were produced, with
   patterns in agreement to vegetation cover fragmentation, topography, and
   other site-specific characteristics. Validation shows average error of
   0.053 for EF and of 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3) for SSM. The results are
   comparable or better to those reported in analogous studies performed in
   similar areas. This implies that the investigated approach performs well
   under the semi-arid conditions characterizing the experimental set up.
   To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of the
   combined use of the `simplified triangle' with very high-resolution UAV
   imagery. As such, the findings are of significance regarding the
   potential future use of the `simplified triangle' approach particularly
   with very fine resolution imagery such as that provided by UAV for
   mapping and monitoring EF and SSM in agricultural and natural
   ecosystems.},

Title = {The Impact of SMOS Soil Moisture Data Assimilation within the
   Operational Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {In this study the impacts of Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS)
   soil moisture data assimilation upon the streamflow prediction of the
   operational Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS) were investigated.
   Two GloFAS experiments were performed, one which used
   hydro-meteorological forcings produced with the assimilation of the SMOS
   data, the other using forcings which excluded the assimilation of the
   SMOS data. Both sets of experiment results were verified against
   streamflow observations in the United States and Australia. Skill scores
   were computed for each experiment against the observation datasets, the
   differences in the skill scores were used to identify where GloFAS skill
   may be affected by the assimilation of SMOS soil moisture data. In
   addition, a global assessment was made of the impact upon the 5th and
   95th GloFAS flow percentiles to see how SMOS data assimilation affected
   low and high flows respectively. Results against in-situ observations
   found that GloFAS skill score was only affected by a small amount. At a
   global scale, the results showed a large impact on high flows in areas
   such as the Hudson Bay, central United States, the Sahel and Australia.
   There was no clear spatial trend to these differences as opposing signs
   occurred within close proximity to each other. Investigating the
   differences between the simulations at individual gauging stations
   showed that they often only occurred during a single flood event; for
   the remainder of the simulation period the experiments were almost
   identical. This suggests that SMOS data assimilation may affect the
   generation of surface runoff during high flow events, but may have less
   impact on baseflow generation during the remainder of the hydrograph. To
   further understand this, future work could assess the impact of SMOS
   data assimilation upon specific hydrological components such as surface
   and subsurface runoff.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND FOOD RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The study investigated the compounding effects of a climate smart
   package based upon indigenous/traditional practices implemented by local
   farmers decades ago. The package comprised combinations of various
   practices such as mulch, no-tillage, tillage and nitrogen based
   fertilizer. Their compounding effects were investigated on maize growth,
   grain yield, and plant biomass in three successive crop cycles in the
   region of Vacoas, Mauritius. Nitrogen based fertilizer (ammonium
   sulphate) was applied at 120 kg/ha to its corresponding treatment, and
   maize mulch was applied as full coverage (24 t/ha). A 4 x 3 x 2
   completely randomized block design with 4 treatments: mulch, fertilizer,
   tillage and no-tillage was tested at 2 levels and replicated 3 times in
   the trials. Results showed that fertilizer was the most important factor
   in maize production; maize treated with fertilizer, by itself or in
   combination with other treatments, gave the highest yield. Tillage was
   seen to increase bulk density, while mulch was observed to limit loss of
   soil organic carbon, and potassium. Addition of fertilizer was found to
   be the cause in reducing pH. The combination of tillage-mulch-fertilizer
   was expected to be high yielding; however it was observed that potassium
   was the limiting factor that induced a reduction in overall yield.},

Abstract = {Plastic film mulch in agricultural production becomes essential to
   maintaining crop yields in arid and semiarid areas. However, the
   presence of residual film in farmland soil has also drawn much
   attention. In this study, three experiments were conducted. The first
   two experimental designs included 0, 450, 1 350, and 2 700 kg ha-1 of
   residual film pieces of approximately 5 cm side length added to field
   soil (0-20 cm soil depth) for seven years and added to pots for four
   years. In the third experiment, 1 350 kg ha-1 of the residual film with
   different side lengths (2-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 cm) was added to
   field soil for six years to explore the effect of residual film fragment
   size on soil nutrients, soil microorganisms, crop growth and yields. The
   residual film had little effect on the soil moisture at a field depth of
   0-2 (or 0-1.8) m. There were no significant effects on organic carbon,
   total nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus or available
   phosphorus in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The presence of residual film
   decreased the richness and diversity of the bacterial community of the
   surface soil of the residual film, but it had no significant effect on
   the microbial community of the non-surface soil. The emergence rates of
   wheat and lentils occasionally decreased significantly with different
   amounts of residue fragments added to the field. At 450-2 700 kg ha-1,
   the residual film reduced the plant height and stem diameter of maize
   and significantly reduced the shoot biomass of harvested maize by
   11-19\%. The average yields of maize and potato over the seven years
   decreased, but there were almost no significant statistical differences
   among the treatments. These results provide important data for a
   comprehensive scientific understanding of the effects of residual film
   on soil and crops in dryland farming systems.},

Title = {Negative Pressure Irrigation System Reduces Soil Nitrogen Loss for
   Lettuce during Greenhouse Production},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Negative pressure irrigation (NPI) to grow crops reduces the application
   of fertilizer and water while also promoting yield and quality. However,
   plantation vegetables usually require a large input of nitrogen (N)
   fertilizer in a greenhouse setting, which will lower the soil quality
   and accelerate the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the purpose
   of this research was to explore planting lettuce under an NPI system
   that retrenches N fertilizer application and mitigates N2O emissions
   compared with conventional irrigation (CI). This research proved that
   under NPI conditions, nitrate and ammonium fluctuated slightly in the
   soil, stabilizing in the range of 18-28 mg kg(-1), while that of CI was
   20-55 mg kg(-1). The NPI alleviated N2O emissions, and NPI-N150 and
   NPI-N105 decreased them by 18\% and 32\%, respectively, compared with
   those for CI-N150. The main explanation was that the NPI inhibited the
   formation of NO3--N, reduced the copies number of AOA and AOB as well as
   the abundance of Nitrospira in the soil, and weakened the soil nitrate
   reductase and urease activities. The results of this research provide a
   reliable scientific method for reducing the use of water and N
   fertilizer while cultivating lettuce, as well as for reducing N2O
   emissions from agricultural facilities.},

Title = {Possibility of Zhuhai-1 Hyperspectral Imagery for Monitoring Salinized
   Soil Moisture Content Using Fractional Order Differentially Optimized
   Spectral Indices},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The possibility of quantitative inversion of salinized soil moisture
   content (SMC) from Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery and the application
   effect of fractional order differentially optimized spectral indices
   were discussed, which provided new research ideas for improving the
   accuracy of hyperspectral remote sensing inversion. The hyperspectral
   data from indoor and Zhuhai-1 remote sensing imagery were resampled to
   the same spectral scale. The soil hyperspectral data were processed by
   fractional order differential preprocessing method and optimized
   spectral indices method, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC/r)
   analysis was made with SMC data. The sensitive optimized spectral
   indices were used to establish the ground hyperspectral estimation
   model, and a variety of modeling methods were used to select the best
   SMC inversion model. The results were as follows: the maximum
   one-dimensional r between SMC and the 466-938 nm band was -0.635, the
   maximum one-dimensional r with the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum was
   0.665, and the maximum two-dimensional r with the difference index (DI)
   calculated by the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum was +/- 0.72. The
   maximum three-dimensional r with the triangle vegetation index (TVI)
   calculated from the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum reached 0.755, which
   exceeded the one-dimensional r extreme value of 400-2400 nm. The TreeNet
   gradient boosting machine (TGBM) regression model had the highest
   modeling accuracy, with a calibration coefficient of determination
   (R-C(2)) = 0.887, calibration root mean square error (RMSEC) = 2.488\%,
   standard deviation (SD) = 6.733\%, and r = 0.942. However, the partial
   least squares regression (PLSR) model had the strongest predictive
   ability, with validation coefficient of determination (R-V(2)) = 0.787,
   validation root mean square error (RMSEV) = 3.247\%, and relative
   prediction deviation (RPD) = 2.071. The variable importance in
   projection (VIP) method could not only improve model efficiency but also
   increased model accuracy. R-C(2) of the optimal PLSR model was 0.733,
   RMSEC was 3.028\%, R-V(2) was 0.805, RMSEV was 3.100\%, RPD was 1.976,
   and Akaike information criterion (AIC) was 151.050. The three-band
   optimized spectral indices with fractional differential pretreatment
   could to a certain extent break through the limitation of visible
   near-infrared spectrum in SMC estimation due to the lack of shortwave
   infrared spectra, which made it possible to quantitatively retrieve
   saline SMC on the basis of Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery.},

Year = {2021},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in vegetation growth,
   terrestrial hydrological cycle, and regional climate change. In this
   article, the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation
   System (CLDAS) SM was validated at multiscale and multidepth against in
   situ measurements over the Tibetan plateau, and the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System (GLDAS) SM was also used as a reference for the
   validation process. The results revealed the following: First, in
   validations using the large, medium, and small scale networks, the small
   network achieved comparatively superior accuracy with a higher fitting
   degree and smaller statistical error, proving the reliability and
   robustness of densely clustered in situ stations. Second, the CLDAS SM
   can correctly present the promotion effect from precipitation. The most
   significant response of the CLDAS SM to precipitation lagged from 1 to 3
   days in terms of growing depth, whereas promotion to SM tended to
   decrease as the soil depth increased. Third, CLDAS and GLDAS reasonably
   fitted in situ measurements in the frozen and unfrozen seasons, while
   their bias gradually increased with increasing depth. The SM errors in
   the snow-covered region were relatively stable. Diurnal land surface
   temperature exhibited a positive correlation with the bias of top-layer
   SM. In summary, this article shows that CLDAS SM retrievals favorably
   reproduced values and dynamics of in situ measurements and can be
   expected to act as a valuable reference for water cycle studies and
   climate evolution analysis.},

Title = {Wheat root system architecture and soil moisture distribution in an
   aggregated soil using neutron computed tomography},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {359},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Non-invasive techniques are essential to deepen our understanding of
   root-soil interactions in situ. Neutron computed tomography (NCT) is an
   example of such techniques that have been successfully used to study
   these interactions in high resolution. Many of the studies using NCT
   however, have invariably focused on lupine plants and thus there is
   limited information available on other more commercially important
   staple crop plants such as wheat and rice. Also considering the high
   neutron sensitivity to hydrogen (e.g. water in roots or soil organic
   matter), nearly all previous in-situ NCT studies have used a relatively
   homogeneous porous media such as sand, low in soil organic matter and
   free from soil aggregates, to obtain high-quality images. However to
   expand the scope of the use of NCT to other more commercially important
   crops and in less homogenous soils, in this study we focused on wheat
   root growth in a soil that contained a considerable amount of soil
   organic matter (SOM) and different sized aggregates. As such, the main
   aims of this research were (1) to unravel wheat (Triticum aestivum cv.
   Fielder) root system architecture (RSA) when grown in an aggregated
   sandy loam soil (< 4 mm) with 4\% SOM content, (2) Map in 3D, soil water
   distribution after a brief drying period and (3) to understand how the
   root system interacts with soil moisture distribution brought about by
   soil structural heterogeneity. To achieve these, wheat seedlings were
   grown for 13-days in aluminium tubes (100 mm height and 18 mm diameter)
   packed with soil and imaged for the first time at the IMAT neutron
   beamline (in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK). To the best of our
   knowledge, this is also the first study to use NCT to study wheat root
   architectural development. Our study proved that NCT can successfully be
   used to reveal wheat RSA in a heterogeneous aggregated soils with
   moderate amounts of SOM. Lateral root growth within the soil column was
   increased in regions with increased finer soil separates. NCT was also
   able to successfully map water distribution in a 3D and we show that
   large macro-aggregates preferentially retained relatively higher soil
   moisture in comparison to the smaller soil separates within our samples
   (Fig. 1). This highlights the importance large macro aggregates in
   sustainable soil management as they may be able to provide plants water
   during periodic dry spells. More in situ investigations are required to
   further understand the impact of different aggregate sizes on RSA and
   water uptake.},

   Production in an Organic Minimum Tillage System},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {17},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Reduced nutrient mineralization rates under minimum tillage are usually
   compensated by mineral fertilizer application. These, however, cannot be
   applied in organic farming systems. We hypothesized that an organic
   minimum tillage system based on frequent cover cropping and application
   of dead mulch would improve soil fertility and compensate for the
   potential negative effects of minimum tillage. Two long-term field
   experiments were set up in 2010 and 2011 to compare plowing versus
   minimum tillage including the application of transferred mulch. A second
   factor, the application of compost versus mineral potassium and
   phosphorus, was also compared. In 2019, soils were analyzed for soil pH,
   organic carbon, macro- and micronutrients, microbial biomass, microbial
   activity, and total nematode abundance. In addition, performance of pea
   in the same soils was determined under greenhouse conditions. Across
   both experiments, macronutrients (+52\%), micronutrients (+11\%),
   microbial biomass (+51\%), microbial activity (+86\%), and bacterivorous
   nematodes (+112\%) increased in minimum tillage compared to the
   plow-based system. In the greenhouse, pea biomass was 45\% higher in the
   soil that had been subjected to minimum tillage compared to the plow. In
   conclusion, soil fertility can be improved in organic minimum tillage
   systems, which include intensive cover cropping and the application of
   dead mulch, over plow-based systems.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Few studies have quantified soil greenhouse gas (GHG) - CH4, CO2 N2O -
   annual fluxes directly from smallholder maize cropping systems under
   different soil fertility management technologies in Sub Saharan Africa.
   We quantified soil GHG annual fluxes from smallholder maize cropping
   systems under four different soil fertility management technologies in
   the Central Highlands of Kenya. We regularly sampled GHG from 2nd March
   2018 to 1st March 2019 (1 year) in three maize farms using a static
   chamber technique. The fertility management technologies were: inorganic
   fertilizer, animal manure, animal manure combined with inorganic
   fertilizer, and a Control (No external input). The experimental design
   was a randomized complete block design replicated thrice. Cumulative
   annual soil fluxes ranged from -2.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the
   control treatment to -1.62 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the manure
   combined with inorganic fertilizer treatment, 4810 kg CO2-C ha(-1)
   yr(-1) from the control treatment to 6576 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from
   the inorganic fertilizer treatment, and 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from
   the control treatment to 0.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic
   fertilizer treatment for CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes, respectively.
   Fertilizer treatment produced the highest CO2 emissions (p < 0.001), N2O
   emissions (P < 0.001), and yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSE), (0.028 g
   N2O-N kg(-1) grain yield). A combination of manure and inorganic
   fertilizer produced the highest CH4 fluxes (p = 0.035) across
   treatments. We concluded that a judicious combination of organic
   resources (animal manure) and inorganic resources (fertilizer) has the
   potential to enhance food security while mitigating soil greenhouse gas
   emissions in SSA.},

Title = {Evaluation of an Adaptive Soil Moisture Bias Correction Approach in the
   ECMWF Land Data Assimilation System},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) observations are widely assimilated
   in global land data assimilation systems. These systems typically assume
   zero-mean errors in the land surface model and observations. In
   practice, systematic differences (biases) exist between the observed and
   modelled SM. Commonly, the observed SM biases are removed by rescaling
   techniques or via a machine learning approach. However, these methods do
   not account for non-stationary biases, which can result from issues with
   the satellite retrieval algorithms or changes in the land surface model.
   Therefore, we test a novel application of adaptive SM bias correction
   (BC) in the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)
   land data assimilation system. A two-stage filter is formulated to
   dynamically correct biases from satellite-derived active ASCAT C-band
   and passive L-band SMOS surface SM observations. This complements the
   operational seasonal rescaling of the ASCAT observations and the SMOS
   neural network retrieval while allowing the assimilation to correct
   subseasonal-scale errors. Experiments are performed on the ECMWF
   stand-alone surface analysis, which is a simplified version of the
   integrated forecasting system. Over a 3 year test period, the adaptive
   BC reduces the seasonal-scale (observation-forecast) departures by up to
   20\% (30\%) for the ASCAT (SMOS). The adaptive BC leads to (1) slight
   improvements in the SM analysis performance and (2) moderate but
   statistically significant reductions in the 1-5 day relative humidity
   forecast errors in the boundary layer of the Northern Hemisphere
   midlatitudes. Future work will test the adaptive SM BC in the full
   integrated forecasting system.},

Abstract = {Integrated-crop-livestock-forestry (ICLF) systems are currently promoted
   as a measure for sustainable intensification of agricultural production.
   However, due to complex interactions among ICLF components, we are still
   lacking evidence about the system's resilience regarding water
   availability, especially for regions characterized by pronounced wet and
   dry seasons and frequent droughts. For a mature ICLF system in the
   Cerrado biome of central-west Brazil comprising rows of eucalyptus trees
   (Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, H13 clone) at a spacing of
   22 m in combination with Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS Plata pasture we
   continuously measured soil moisture (SM) until 1 m depth and supported
   this data with measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)
   and above ground green grass biomass (AGBM) across transects between the
   tree rows for almost two years. Across the seasons a distinct gradient
   was observed with SM being lower close to the tree rows than in the
   space between them. During winter SM decreased to critical values near
   the tree lines in the topsoil. During spring and summer, incident PAR
   was 72\% and 86\% lower close to the trees than at the center point. For
   autumn and winter PAR was more evenly distributed between the tree rows
   due to inclination with notably up to four times more radiation input
   near the tree lines compared to spring and summer. AGBM showed a clear
   distribution with maximum values in the center and about half of the
   biomass close to the tree rows. Our data suggest that, restrictions in
   AGBM accumulation shifted among seasons between water limitations in
   winter and light limitations during summer. Interestingly, SM changes
   during wetting and drying events were most pronounced in subsoils near
   the tree rows, while the topsoil showed much less fluctuations. The
   subsoil in central position showed the lowest SM dynamics in response to
   drought maintaining a relative high and constant SM content, therefore
   functioning as important water reservoirs likely improving the
   resilience of the system to drought stress. Results of this study could
   help to improve management and the design of ICLF systems in view of
   sustainability and resistance to (water) crises but should be further
   supported by in depth analysis of soil water dynamics as affected by
   climate gradients, soil types and different management practices.},

   semi-arid areas. In the present study, a new approach was adopted to
   estimate surface soil moisture based on multi-index models using
   reflective and thermal indices as well as surface energy balance
   system-Iran (SEBS-Iran) in pastures and farmlands in Qom province, Iran
   in 2016-2017. To select the best model based on remote sensing (RS)
   indices, 12 models were designed and after analysis, the best ones were
   selected. Afterward, the results of the SEBS-Iran algorithm and the
   improved multi-index model {[}normalized multi-band drought index
   (NMDI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface
   temperature (LST) and the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI)]
   were calibrated with field data in the two studied fields (pastures and
   farmlands). The findings indicated that the multi-index model
   NMDI-TDVI-LST-NDVI (R = 0.95) and SEBS-Iran (R = 0.93) both had
   significant correlations with measured soil moisture. Regarding both
   models in farmlands and pastures, the SEBS-Iran regression model was
   closer to the line of fit, andR(2)in the two fields was 0.95 and 0.96,
   respectively. Compared to SEBS-Iran, the multi-index model showed lower
   coefficient of determination in pastures (0.71) due to the higher
   accuracy of SEBS-Iran in areas with lower vegetation density. Generally,
   both methods were found to be suitable for soil moisture estimation. The
   multi-index model can be used to estimate soil moisture in densely
   vegetated areas on a large scale due to its simplicity and good
   accuracy. Moreover, the highly accurate SEBS-Iran model can be used even
   in sparsely vegetated areas.},

Title = {Numerical assessment of a soil moisture controlled wastewater SDI
   disposal system in Alabama Black Belt Prairie},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {263},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To promote the environmental sustainability of rural sanitation, a soil
   moisture controlled wastewater subsurface drip irrigation (SDI)
   dispersal system was field tested in the Black Belt Prairie of Alabama,
   USA. The soil moisture control strategy was designed to regulate
   wastewater disposal timing according to drain field conditions to
   prevent hydraulic overloading and corresponding environmental hazard.
   CW2D/HYDRUS simulation modeling was utilized to explore
   difficult-to-measure aspects of system performance. While the control
   system successfully adapted hydraulic loading rate to changing drain
   field conditions, saturated field conditions during the dormant season
   presented practical application challenges. The paired field experiment
   and simulation model demonstrate that soil biofilm growth was stimulated
   in the vicinity of drip emitters. Although biofilm growth is critical in
   maintaining adequate COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies, the efficient
   removal of biodegradable COD itself by soil biofilm limits
   denitrification of formed NO3- - N. Furthermore, stimulated soil biofilm
   growth can create soil clogging around drip emitters, which was
   discerned in the field experiment along with salt accumulation, both of
   which were verified by simulation. Comparable modeling of system
   performance in sand and clay media demonstrate that the placement of
   soil moisture sensors within the drain field can have pronounced impacts
   on system hydraulic performance, depending on the soil permeability.
   Overall, the soil moisture control strategy tested is shown as a viable
   supplemental technology to promote the environmental sustainability of
   rural sanitation systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Novel Design of a Unilateral Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Sensor for
   Soil Moisture Detection Based on a Simplified Analytical Model},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {62},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in terrestrial systems
   because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the
   continental surface and the atmosphere. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
   technology is widely used for the analysis of porous media in SM due to
   its unique sensitivity to hydrogen protons. Unlike traditional
   laboratory NMR systems, unilateral NMR (UNMR) systems allow for the
   placement of detection targets outside the sensor space, thereby
   enabling in situ detection capabilities. However, in the existing
   designs of UNMR sensors, the magnetic field location is typically
   determined after the sensor has been designed. In this study, a novel
   UNMR sensor design scheme is proposed based on a simplified analytical
   model (SAM) to solve this problem. In contrast to conventional
   practices, this scheme places a primary emphasis on the identification
   of detection positions as its initial step, followed by the computation
   of magnet structure parameters. Concurrently, the mechanical design of
   the proposed UNMR sensor offers a more adaptable approach to regulation.
   The scheme consists of two components: magnetic field calculation and
   optimization of structural parameters. Notably, the proposed model
   exhibits a remarkable enhancement in calculation efficiency, surpassing
   the baseline by more than 70 times within a single iteration, compared
   with the traditional analytical model (TAM). The goodness of fit between
   the measured magnetic field distribution and the optimized results
   surpasses 0.99, thereby providing additional evidence of the sensor's
   effectiveness. In addition, the sensor's performance is demonstrated
   through measurements conducted on samples with varying SM content.},

   Soil Disturbances: Contactless Ultrasonic System},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil moisture has been considered a key variable in governing the
   terrestrial ecosystem. However, it is challenging to preserve indigenous
   soil characteristics using conventional soil moisture monitoring methods
   that require maximum soil contacts. To overcome this issue, we developed
   a non-destructive method of evaluating soil moisture using a contactless
   ultrasonic system. This system was designed to measure leaky Rayleigh
   waves at the air-soil joint-half space. The influences of soil moisture
   on leaky Rayleigh waves were explored under sand, silt, and clay in a
   controlled experimental design. Our results showed that there were
   strong relationships between the energy and amplitude of leaky Rayleigh
   waves and soil moisture for all three soil cases. These results can be
   explained by reduced soil strengths during evaporation processes for
   coarse soil particles as opposed to fine soil particles. To evaluate
   soil moisture based on the dynamic parameters and wave properties
   obtained from the observed leaky Rayleigh waves, we used the random
   forest model. The accuracy of predicted soil moisture was exceptional
   for test data sets under all soil types (R-2 >= 0.98, RMSE <= 0.0089
   m(3) m(-3)). That is, our study demonstrated that the leaky Rayleigh
   waves had great potential to continuously assess soil moisture
   variations without soil disturbances.},

Title = {Improving the prediction of monsoon depressions by assimilating ASCAT
   soil moisture in NCUM-R modeling system},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {272},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The present study investigates the impact of assimilation of satellite
   derived soil wetness data from Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) on
   simulation of inland moving monsoon depressions (MDs) over Indian region
   using high resolution NCUM-R forecasting system. The simplified Extended
   Kalman Filter (sEKF) based Land Surface Data Assimilation (LSDA) system
   is used to create land surface soil moisture initial conditions for
   NCUM-R by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture (SM) along with screen level
   observations. Two numerical experiments, namely CTL (incorporating only
   screen level observations in LSDA) and ASCAT (assimilating both ASCAT SM
   and screen level observations in LSDA) are carried out to update the
   model soil moisture initial conditions. Identical atmospheric initial
   condition prepared considering the 4DVAR data assimilation technique is
   used in both experiments. The results of this study show that the
   assimilation of remotely sensed SM has a beneficial impact on MD
   simulation, its movement, structure and associated precipitation. The
   analysis increment of fluxes from ASCAT experiment clearly shows
   properly coupled positive feedback between land and atmosphere. SM in
   the vicinity of MD is considerably improved in the ASCAT analysis as
   compared to the CTL analysis and is well correlated with the observed
   rainfall over the regions. The root mean square error of top layer SM is
   decreased by 5 to 15\% in ASCAT analyses compared to CTL analyses. The
   land-atmosphere coupling feedback is investigated by using Dirmeyer's
   indices, it is noticed that the precipitation modulated by the latent
   heat flux is higher in ASCAT simulation than in the CTL simulation. This
   improvement is due to the proper representation of surface conditions by
   assimilating the satellite SM observations into LSDA. The contribution
   of individual terms of vorticity equation and total vorticity tendency
   is considerably well represented in ASCAT experiment as compared to the
   CTL experiment during the various phases of MD. Overall, this study
   indicates that the use of ASCAT SM in the preparation of soil moisture
   initial conditions helps to improve the forecast of MDs by the regional
   NWP system.},

Abstract = {This 20-month study of a prairie hillslope seep system builds upon and
   extends the soil moisture record from a previous study conducted during
   the most extreme drought ever recorded in Texas. We seek to improve
   understanding of how prolonged drought impacts seep-headwater hydrology,
   and to determine how well dominant vegetation reflects changes in
   volumetric soil moisture (theta v). Results show the entire hillslope
   saturates after storm events, but due to severe drought, no surface
   runoff or channel flow was recorded. We documented changes in soil
   moisture, with the highest theta v occurring along the deeper footslope
   soils. We hypothesize hyperseasonal environments, or seasonal
   waterlogging/desiccation of upland vegetation in poorly drained soils,
   exist in the study area and are the first to quantify hyperseasonality,
   or \% change in magnitude of theta v throughout a hydrologic year. The
   seep and riparian plots aligned with lower hyperseasonality, indicating
   seasonal hypoxia, but not complete desiccation. High hyperseasonality
   occurred along the midslope barrens, indicative of a true hyperseasonal
   environment. We suggest a >= 90\% threshold would likely indicate true
   hyperseasonal cyclicity of anaerobic and xeric regimes. Our results
   provide insight to how extreme drought impacts seep-headwater systems,
   and how predicted hotter, drier conditions may alter their hydrologic
   regime.},

Abstract = {Climate emulators are models calibrated on Earth system models (ESMs) to
   replicate their behavior. Thanks to their low computational cost, these
   tools are becoming increasingly important to accelerate the exploration
   of emission scenarios and the coupling of climate information to other
   models. However, the emulation of regional climate extremes and water
   cycle variables has remained challenging. The MESMER emulator was
   recently expanded to represent regional temperature extremes in the new
   ``MESMER-X{''} version, which is targeted at impact-related variables,
   including extremes. This paper presents a further expansion of MESMER-X
   to represent indices related to fire weather and soil moisture. Given a
   trajectory of global mean temperature, the extended emulator generates
   spatially resolved realizations for the seasonal average of the Canadian
   Fire Weather Index (FWI), the number of days with extreme fire weather,
   the annual average of the soil moisture, and the annual minimum of the
   monthly average soil moisture. For each ESM, the emulations mimic the
   statistical distributions and the spatial patterns of these indicators.
   For each of the four variables considered, we evaluate the performances
   of the emulations by calculating how much their quantiles deviate from
   those of the ESMs. Given how it performs over a large range of annual
   indicators, we argue that this framework can be expanded to further
   variables. Overall, the now expanded MESMER-X emulator can emulate
   several climate variables, including climate extremes and soil moisture
   availability, and is a useful tool for the exploration of regional
   climate changes and their impacts.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Rapid, cost-effective, and environmentally friendly analysis of key soil
   fertility attributes requires an ideal combination of sensors. The
   individual and combined performance of visible and near infrared (VNIR)
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF),
   and laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) was assessed for
   predicting clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC),
   pH, base saturation (V), and extractable (ex-) nutrients in tropical
   soils. A set of 102 samples, collected from two agricultural fields,
   with broad ranges of fertility attributes were selected. Two contrasting
   data fusion approaches have been applied for modeling: (i) merging
   spectral data of different sensors followed by partial least squares
   regression (PLS), known as fusion before prediction; and (ii) applying
   the Granger and Ramanathan (GR) averaging approach, known as fusion
   after prediction. Results showed VNIR as individual technique to be the
   best for the prediction of clay and OM content (2.61 <= residual
   prediction deviation (RPD) <= 3.37), while the chemical attributes CEC,
   V, ex-P, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were better predicted (1.82 <= RPD <=
   4.82) by elemental analysis techniques (i.e., XRF and LIBS). Only pH
   cannot be predicted regardless the technique. The attributes OM, V, and
   ex-P were best predicted using single-sensor approaches, while the
   attributes clay, CEC, pH, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were overall best
   predicted using multi-sensor approaches. Regarding the performance of
   the multi-sensor approaches, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg, were best predicted
   (RPD of 4.98, 5.30, and 4.11 for ex-K, ex-Ca and ex-Mg, respectively)
   using two-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF for ex-K and XRF + LIBS for
   ex-Ca and ex-Mg), while clay, CEC and pH were best predicted (RPD of
   4.02, 2.63, and 1.32 for clay, CEC, and pH, respectively) with the
   three-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF + LIBS). Therefore, the best
   combination of sensors for predicting key fertility attributes proved to
   be attribute-specific, which is a drawback of the data fusion approach.
   The present work is pioneering in highlighting benefits and limitations
   of the in tandem application of VNIR, XRF, and LIBS spectroscopies for
   fertility analysis in tropical soils.},

Title = {A cooperative regulation method for greenhouse soil moisture and light
   using Gaussian curvature and machine learning algorithms},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {215},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) exerts a significant impact on crop growth,
   interacting with environmental factors such as temperature,
   photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and CO2, ultimately affecting
   crop photosynthesis (Pn). This study employs a nested experimental
   design to investigate the photosynthetic activity of cucumber seedlings
   under diverse environmental conditions and establishes a support vector
   regression (SVR) model for Pn prediction. The SVR model takes
   temperature, PPFD, SM, and CO2 concentration as inputs and demonstrates
   a high level of accuracy (The model's coefficient of determination =
   0.9830, root mean square error = 0.9138). Subsequently, through a
   generalized additive model, the study unveils the significant impact of
   interactions between SM and PPFD on Pn. Accordingly, this research
   constructs a Pn response surface based on these two factors and
   identifies the maximum point of Gaussian curvature on this surface.
   Polynomial regression is applied to these points, yielding a
   comprehensive regulation strategy for SM and PPFD. In comparison to
   traditional methods based on maximizing Pn, this innovative approach
   reduces Pn by 12.9 \% while significantly conserving light (35.59 \%)
   and water (32.80 \%) consumption. Although no significant changes are
   observed in crop physiological traits (plant height, stem diameter, dry
   weight, fresh weight), substantial variations are noted in irrigation
   volume and PPFD consumption. Thus, the regulation strategy proposed in
   this study embodies efficiency and energy conservation in greenhouse
   crop cultivation.},

Title = {A Method for Downscaling Satellite Soil Moisture Based on Land Surface
   Temperature and Net Surface Shortwave Radiation},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Abstract = {Due to the coarse spatial resolution of currently available microwave
   (mostly passive) soil moisture (SM) products, it is difficult to apply
   these SM data in watersheds or at local scales. `lb this end, a number
   of downscaling approaches have been developed to improve the spatial
   resolution of microwave SM products. Specifically, the
   optical-/thermal-based downscaling methods are most widely used in
   recent decades. However, such methods normally rely on instantaneous
   optical/thermal land surface parameters, which are commonly inapplicable
   under cloudy conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop a new
   downscaling method based on the temporal variation in geostationary
   satellite-derived land surface temperature and net surface shortwave
   radiation. The proposed method has a certain potential to improve data
   availability under cloudy conditions, because geostationary satellites
   are capable of providing land surface parameters at high temporal
   resolution. The proposed method was tested over the REMEDHUS network in
   Spain. The scaling strategy of cumulative distribution function matching
   was used to remove systematic differences in spatial mismatch between
   satellite pixels and in situ SM measurements. Results indicate that the
   downscaled SM agrees well with in situ measurements and has comparable
   accuracy with the original microwave SM product. The overall root mean
   square errors with the in situ measurements for the original microwave
   SM and the downscaled SM are 0.054 and 0.057 m(3)/m(3), respectively.
   This method not only has a successful attempt to downscale microwave SM
   data using temporal information but also has the potential to avoid the
   failure of traditional instantaneous observations-based downscaling
   procedure due to clouds.},

Abstract = {Many remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products have been developed with
   global coverage. However, most of them are derived from passive
   microwave observations with very coarse resolution, greatly constraining
   the applications at regional scales. To increase the spatial resolution,
   a downscaling method is developed to downscale the 36-km Soil Moisture
   Active Passive L3 SM (SMAP SM) product to 1 km using the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (8-d land surface
   temperature, LST, and 16-d normalized difference vegetation index,
   NDVI). In this method, a linking model is first established between SM
   and LST and NDVI, and a self-adaptive window method is applied with the
   use of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to obtain an
   optimal local regression. Then, the uncertainty of the linking model,
   expressed as the regression residual, is redistributed to
   fine-resolution pixels to analyze the consistency before and after
   downscaling. The method was applied to the Iberian Peninsula to produce
   the 8-d downscaled SM product in 2016. The downscaled SM was validated
   with the in-situ SM network (REMEDHUS). A good agreement was found
   between the two data sets, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.87
   and an unbiased root-mean-squared error (ubRMSE) of 0.043 m(3)/m(3) at a
   network level. At station level, the R is larger than 0.6 for all the
   REMEDHUS stations, with an ubRMSE smaller than 0.06 m(3)/m(3). The
   evaluation indicates the good potential of the proposed method in the SM
   downscaling, which achieves a robust consistency and provides rich
   spatial information while maintaining good accuracy.},

Title = {Multi-sensor assimilation of SMOS brightness temperature and GRACE
   terrestrial water storage observations for soil moisture and shallow
   groundwater estimation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {227},
Pages = {12-27},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provided
   monthly global estimates of the vertically integrated terrestrial water
   storage with about 300-400-km horizontal resolution between 2002 and
   2017. Since 2009, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission
   observes global L-band brightness temperatures, which are sensitive to
   near-surface soil moisture, with a revisit time of 1-3 days at a nominal
   43-km spatial resolution. This work investigates if the multi-sensor
   assimilation of these observations into the Catchment land surface model
   can improve the estimation of 0-5 cm ``surface{''} soil moisture, 0-100
   cm ``root-zone{''} soil moisture, and shallow (unconfined) groundwater
   levels. Single-sensor GRACE or SMOS assimilation and multi-sensor GRACE
   + SMOS assimilation experiments were performed over the continental U.S.
   for 6 years (July 2010 June 2016). GRACE data assimilation mostly
   improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data
   assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The
   benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the
   multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more
   consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when
   multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the
   multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS experiment, the water storage increments
   introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are
   anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove
   water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments
   add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused
   by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE
   analysis.},

   using the successive correction method},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Two soil moisture content analysis products, each with a spatial
   resolution of 0.0625 degrees and a temporal resolution of 1 h from 1
   October 2015 to 1 October 2021 in the Jing-Jin-Ji area, have been
   developed and evaluated. Using a quality control (QC) scheme based on
   the biweight method and a successive correction method (SCM) with
   different weighting functions introduced from the Cressman and/or Barnes
   methods, the soil moisture collected from China Land Data Assimilation
   System version 2.0 was taken as the background data. Two soil analysis
   products with induced hourly station soil observations were constructed
   and further compared with in situ observations and satellite products.
   Results show that with the biweight method, the outliers of soil
   moisture could be identified, and that the number of these was less than
   10\% of the actual reported samples. The analysis product is more
   accurate with the Cressman weighting function than with the Barnes as
   the root mean square error was reduced by 30\% to 0.06, while the
   correlation coefficient increased by 73\% to 0.59, compared to the
   control. These results indicate that the Cressman product is a useful
   and promising soil moisture data set. The proposed Cressman method is
   computationally simple and efficient, so the product can be easily
   updated to keep pace with significant increases in the volume of soil
   moisture data. The methods used here for QC, SCM, and comparison could
   help evaluate and improve land surface models and their soil moisture
   products.},

Title = {Sensitivity-Based Soil Moisture Assimilation for Improved Streamflow
   Forecast Using a Novel Forward Sensitivity Method (FSM) Approach},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {58},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The need for and the use of different data assimilation techniques to
   improve the quality of streamflow forecast is now well established. In
   this paper, the goal is to demonstrate the power of a new class of
   methods known as the forward sensitivity method (FSM) which is based on
   the temporal evolution of model sensitivities with respect to the
   control variables consisting of initial conditions and parameters. FSM
   operates in two phases: the first phase provides a simple algorithm for
   placing observations at or near where the square of forward
   sensitivities attains their maximum values. Using only this selected
   subset of observations in a weighted least squares method, the second
   phase then provides an estimate of the unknown elements of the control
   variables. In this paper, FSM based assimilation is applied to a simple
   class of two parameter model in a medium-sized agriculture dominant
   watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. Four assimilation
   scenarios were tested to determine the effect of assimilating only
   sensitive observations as well as the impact of temporally evolving
   initial condition sensitivity. Sensitivity results showed that
   observations during the monsoon time alone are enough for assimilation
   purposes, which has helped in reducing the computational time greatly.
   Assimilation and forecast results also indicated that the scenarios
   which assimilated only sensitive observations are better in estimating
   daily streamflow. From the obtained results, it is concluded that FSM
   based assimilation has significant potential to improve the streamflow
   simulations, especially in places where data availability remains a
   major challenge.},

Title = {A Method of Soil Moisture Content Estimation at Various Soil Organic
   Matter Conditions Based on Soil Reflectance},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is one of the most important components of all the soil
   properties affecting the global hydrologic cycle. Optical remote sensing
   technology is one of the main parts of soil moisture estimation. In this
   study, we promote a soil moisture-estimating method with applications
   regarding various soil organic matters. The results indicate that the
   soil organic matter had a significant spectral feature at wavelengths
   larger than 900 nm. The existence of soil organic matter would lead to
   darker soil, and this feature was similar to the soil moisture.
   Meanwhile, the effect of the soil organic matter on its reflectance
   overlaps with the effect of soil moisture on its reflected spectrum.
   This can lead to the underestimation of the soil moisture content, with
   an MRE of 21.87\%. To reduce this effect, the absorption of the soil
   organic matter was considered based on the Lambert-Beer law. Then, we
   established an SMCg-estimating model based on the radiative transform
   theory while considering the effect of the soil organic matter. The
   results showed that the effect of the soil organic matter can be
   effectively reduced and the accuracy of the soil moisture estimation was
   increased, while MRE decreased from 21.87\% to 6.53\%.},

Title = {Activation soil moisture accounting (ASMA) for runoff estimation using
   soil conservation service curve number (SCS-CN) method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {589},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In this study, the concept of activation soil moisture (ASM) has been
   conceptualised by coupling the Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) concept
   with the static infiltration component (Fc) for simulating
   rainfall-runoff process. The ASM has been defined as the height of soil
   moisture barrier (or the amount of soil moisture deficit), which must be
   fulfilled before runoff can start. Most of the SCS-CN inspired methods,
   including the original one do not consider ASM in their formulation to
   simulate rainfall-runoff process. To account for ASM, here, we develop
   an activation soil moisture accounting (ASMA) based method (ASMA-SCS-CN)
   by coupling the SMA concept of Michel-Vazken-Perrin (MVP) method with
   the static infiltration (Fc) based Mishra-Singh (MS) method, which
   presents a fuller picture of SMA system. The performance of the
   ASMA-SCS-CN method is compared with the original SCS-CN method, MS
   method and MVP method by applying a large dataset of 56,343 storm events
   from 164 small to large watersheds in the United States using
   goodness-of-fit statistics in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE),
   the root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (nRMSE), percent bias
   (PBIAS), mean absolute error (MAE), standard error (SE) and
   RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The ASMA-SCS-CN method
   has the highest median value of NSE (0.71; varying from 0.11 to 0.97)
   with interquartile range (IQR) as (0.62-0.80) followed by MVP with NSE
   (0.67; varying from 0.10 to 0.0.96) and IQR as (0.57-0.74), MS with NSE
   (0.61; varying from 0.02 to 0.97) and IQR range as (0.46-0.72), and
   SCS-CN with NSE (0.58; varying from 0,01 to 0.92) and IQR as
   (0.44-0.69). The ASMA-SCS-CN method is found to have lowest mean and
   median values of RMSE, nRMSE, MAE, SE and RSR than the MVP, MS and
   SCS-CN method. The PBIAS values of the ASMA-SCS-CN and MVP methods are
   lower than that of MS and SCS-CN method. In addition, the performance of
   all four methods is further evaluated based on the watershed
   characteristics such as landuse, soil type, drainage area, and mean
   rainfall and the results show that in all cases the ASMA-SCS-CN method
   performs much better than the rest of the methods. Overall, the improved
   performance of ASMA-SCS-CN can be attributed to the inclusion of SMA
   along with the static infiltration component for representing the
   complete picture of SMA system in modelling rainfall-runoff process.},

Abstract = {The global validation for SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) Level-4
   surface soil moisture using well-established core validation sites does
   not comprehensively account for all landscapes on earth's surface due to
   the diverse nature of their intrinsic characteristics. Due to the
   inhibitive cost of implementing a standard validation site, this study
   presents an alternative sampling approach suitable for localized
   validation of SMAP data in non-complex terrains. It involves clustering
   a large heterogeneous study area to smaller units of non-complex
   terrains where landscape-defining characteristics are largely
   homogeneous, thus permitting the computation of areal soil moisture as a
   simple arithmetic mean of near-linear point measurements. This allows
   optimization of limited resources (a hand-held moisture sensor with
   site-specific calibrations) to balance the need for spatial
   representativeness of samples in the sampling unit and the need for
   temporal proximity of sampled measurements to the aggregation time of
   the satellite product being validated. For ease of movement, transect
   sampling is implemented along access roads that run across the sampling
   units to allow sufficient measurement replications within a reasonably
   short time. Validations with four different landscapes in Kenya show a
   good agreement between in situ measurements and SMAP with R2 of 0.76,
   0.72, 0.80, and 0.82, and biases of -0.0246, +0.0113, 0.0004, and +
   0.0035 m3 m-3, respectively for Mawego, Kuresoi, Sotik and Kapsuser
   sites. These results only marginally differ from those obtained with a
   spatially distributed sampling method, indicating the potential of the
   proposed sampling design for time and cost effectiveness in validations
   at non-complex terrains. An analysis of the temporal variability of SMAP
   soil moisture in the watershed is also presented, with an assessment of
   its significance in the selection of sampling sites for validation.
   Particularly, the concept of temporal stability of soil moisture as a
   basis for clustering validation sites is evaluated.},

Title = {Monitoring of soil EC for the prediction of soil nutrient regime under
   different soil water and organic matter contents},
Journal = {APPLIED BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {67},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 3},
Abstract = {Smart farms and precision agriculture require automatic monitoring and
   supply of water and nutrients for crops, but sensors to monitor plant
   available nutrients in soil are not available. Soil electrical
   conductivity (EC) is related to nutrients in soil solution, which can be
   affected by soil organic matter, soil texture, temperature, and water
   content. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate factors
   influencing soil EC sensor values by monitoring EC under different soil
   organic matter and water contents. Ten soil samples with various sand
   and clay contents, EC, pH, and organic matter contents were selected and
   saturated with water. Volumetric water content and EC of the soil were
   monitored while drying the soil. Humic acid and manure were added to
   soils in order to evaluate the effect of organic matter on soil EC. Soil
   EC values linearly increased with increasing water content at 10-25\%
   which is favorable water content for plant growth. The EC increased when
   organic matter was added to soils, which was related to ions released
   from the organic matter. Soil EC calibration factor for soil water
   content increased when EC of the soil was high and organic matter was
   added. The sensor EC values in sandy loam and loam soils was related to
   the ion contents in pore water, and exchangeable ions in soil,
   respectively. Sensor EC values were highly correlated with organic
   matter and K contents in soil and can be used as an indicator for plant
   available nutrients in soil. Therefore, the sensor EC at optimal soil
   water content for plant growth can be used to monitor changes in plant
   available nutrients in soil.},

Title = {Cellulose acetate film containing layered double hydroxide: a new method
   for determination of soil phosphorus availability},
Journal = {REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE CIENCIA DO SOLO},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Abstract = {Soil nutrient availability and interpretations of nutrient contents are
   based on the results obtained from specific extraction methods used in
   routine testing laboratories. The development of new extraction methods
   and new extractants with better accuracy is particularly important to
   determine the correct fertilizer rates to be applied. For this purpose,
   this study aims to synthesize, characterize and evaluate the predictive
   capacity of cellulose acetate film containing calcinated layered double
   hydroxide (CAF-LDH-c), as a new extractant and a new method of P
   extraction in soils. Different analyses techniques were used to
   characterize the CAF-LDH-c sample, including X-ray diffraction,
   attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy,
   and scanning electronic microscopy. Soils were collected from twelve
   areas with different management and initial availability of P. The soils
   were subjected to six rates of P and were cultivated with plants. The
   predictive capacity of CAF-LDH-c, as a new extractant of P in different
   soils, was evaluated and compared to Mehlich-1 (M-1), Mehlich-3 (M-3),
   and Mixed Exchange Resin (MER) extractants. Chemical analyses performed
   on CAF-LDH-c showed that LDH in powder form was incorporated into the
   cellulose acetate film. There was a linear relation between P uptake by
   plants and extractable soil P in the soil by CAF-LDH-c, M-1, M-3, and
   MER extractants. The significant correlations between extracted P in the
   soil and P uptake by plants for CAF-LDH-c showed the efficacy of the new
   extractor and the newly proposed method for different types of soils.
   The results from the present study confirm the possibility of using
   CAF-LDH-c extractant as a new methodology to evaluate the availability
   of P in the soil for plant cultivation.},

Abstract = {A method is proposed to estimate the threshold wind speed for dust
   emissions as a function of soil moisture in arid regions. This method,
   which is applicable at the local scale, employs a model of the surface
   heat budget to estimate the spatial distribution of thermal
   inertia-derived soil moisture (TISM) and an analytical footprint model
   to estimate dust source areas. It incorporates readily available
   satellite and meteorological data. The soil moisture inside the dust
   source area is estimated for individual dust phenomena observed at a
   synoptic surface observation site, and then, together with the
   corresponding observed wind speed, the threshold wind speed as a
   function of soil moisture is found by employing the parametrization of
   Fecan et al. (Ann Geophys 17:149-157, 1999). This relationship
   represents the local dust climatology at the observation site, although
   the data include some outliers. The results show that readily available
   data for the natural environment can be used, as an alternative to
   wind-tunnel data, with the parametrization used to derive the threshold
   wind-speed relation. The derived relation indicates the TISM and wind
   speed at which the probability of a dust phenomenon is 10\%. Moreover,
   the threshold wind-speed results are not sensitive to the principal
   footprint-model parameters. The TISM standard error of approximately
   0.04 m(3) m(-3) could significantly affect the results under dry and
   weak-wind conditions, but this sensitivity can be avoided if the soil
   clay content or the soil type at the observation point is known.},

   potassium (K) on 58 Ethiopian agricultural soils. Four soil reference
   groups were sampled for the study. The NH4OAc extractant was used as
   standard method against which K values estimated by other methods were
   compared. Results showed that generally highly significant correlations
   existed among all the methods used for available K extraction. The
   coefficients of determination (R-2) values between NH4OAc method and the
   other methods were 0.90 (M-3), 0.70 (CaCl2), and 0.37(spectral). A
   statistically poor relationship (R-2= 0.07) was found between CaCl(2)and
   spectral methods. On an average, the K extracted by M-3 and
   CaCl(2)amounted to 106 and 49\% of NH4OAc K, respectively while the
   spectral method detected 196\% of the NH4OAc K. The highly significant
   correlation between different soil extraction methods indicated that any
   of the methods can be used to accurately predict the concentration of
   available K in the soil. The correlations between K concentration
   estimated by different methods and plant uptake (product of plant K
   concentration and dry matter yield) of K were the highest with M-3 and
   the lowest with spectral methods with R(2)values of 0.65, 0.64, 0.54 and
   0.16 for M-3, NH4OAc, CaCl(2)and spectral methods, respectively. It can,
   therefore, be generalized that the M- 3 is a suitable extractant for K
   in Ethiopian soils, but further study is recommended to determine how
   these relationships could be translated to plant K uptake under field
   condition. Besides, the spectral measurement of K as a soil test method
   for heterogeneous group of soils warrants further investigation and
   refinement.},

Title = {Hyperspectral sensing and mapping of soil carbon content for amending
   within-field heterogeneity of soil fertility and enhancing soil carbon
   sequestration},
Journal = {PRECISION AGRICULTURE},

Month = {2024 MAY 2},
Abstract = {Soil fertility is one of the most critical bases for high productivity
   and sustainability in crop production. Within-field heterogeneity is
   often problematic in both crop management practices and crop
   productivity. Besides, appropriate soil management practices leads to
   the effective carbon sequestration. Since the soil carbon content (SCC)
   is the most simple and effective indicator of soil fertility, accurate
   and high-resolution mapping of SCC is an essential basis for addressing
   these issues. Here, we developed a tractor-based hyperspectral sensing
   system for speedy and accurate mapping of SCC. A new hybrid spectral
   algorithm linking normalized difference spectral index (h-NDSI) and
   machine learning proved superior. Appropriate algorithms were
   implemented to generate diagnostic map and prescription map from SCC map
   for the variable-rate application of pellet manure. The field
   performance of the sensing/mapping system was tested in the farmers'
   fields in the Fukushima region of Japan where the within-field
   heterogeneity of soil fertility was disastrous due to the
   decontamination after the nuclear power-plant disaster. The structure
   and functioning of the system proved promising. Moreover, the spatial
   simulation by linking the SCC data and a dynamic simulation model
   clearly showed the significant impact of variable-rate application of
   pellet manure on the chronosequential change of SCC, within-field
   heterogeneity, and carbon stock. The systematic linkage of the
   sensing/mapping system with the variable-rate spreader and dynamic
   simulation model would be effective for improving soil fertility and
   soil carbon stock. Applicability of the system will be extended through
   an extensive validation of the predictive models.},

Abstract = {Purpose Soil nutrient management and fertilizer use by farmers are
   important for sustainable grain production. The authors examined the
   effect of an experimental agricultural extension program, the science
   and technology backyard, in promoting sustainable soil nutrient
   management in the North China Plain (NCP). The science and technology
   backyard integrates farmer field schools, field demonstrations, and
   case-to-case counselling to promote sustainable farming practices among
   rural smallholders. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a
   large-scale household survey of more than 2,000 rural smallholders. The
   authors used a multivariate regression analysis as the benchmark to
   assess the effect of the science-and-technology backyard on smallholder
   soil nutrient management. Furthermore, the authors used coarse exact
   matching (CEM) methods to control for potential bias due to
   self-selection and the (endogenous) switching regression approach as the
   main empirical analysis. Findings The results show that the
   science-and-technology backyard program increased smallholders' wheat
   yield by approximately 0.23 standard deviation; however, no significant
   increase in maize yield was observed. Regarding soil nutrient use
   efficiency, the authors found a significant improvement in smallholders'
   phosphorus and potassium use efficiencies for both wheat and maize
   production, and a significant improvement in nitrogen use efficiency for
   wheat production, but no significant improvement of nitrogen use
   efficiency for maize production. Originality/value This study evaluated
   a novel participatory agricultural extension model to improve soil
   nutrient management practices among smallholders. The integration of
   agronomists' scientific knowledge and smallholders' local contextual
   experiences could be an effective way to improve farmers' soil nutrient
   management. This study provides the first quantitative estimates based
   on rigorous impact assessment methods of this novel extension approach
   in rural China.},

Title = {Evaluating and improving the sand storm numerical simulation performance
   in Northwestern China using WRF-Chem and remote sensing soil moisture
   data},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {251},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {This paper aims to test the ability of the WRF-Chem model to simulate
   sand storms in Northwest China and improve the simulation results by
   introducing remote sensing soil moisture data into WRF-Chem. We
   conducted sensitivity tests, including parameterization scheme tests and
   soil moisture tests using WRF-Chem. By comparing various combinations of
   parameterization schemes, which have considerable impacts on sand
   emissions, the most suitable parameterization scheme for WRF-Chem to
   simulate sand storms in Northwest China was selected for establishing
   models in future research. Based on the optimal combination of
   parameterization schemes, the sensitivity of sand emissions to soil
   moisture was tested, indicating that soil moisture has a substantial
   influence on sand emissions and revealing a nonlinear relationship
   between sand emissions and soil moisture. Although sand simulations are
   sensitive to soil moisture, the sand emission volume does not always
   increase with decreasing soil moisture content. Moreover, the soil
   moisture content simulated by WRF-Chem is quite different from that
   observed by satellites. Therefore, we selected ten sand storms that
   occurred in Northwest China in 2009-2018, including weak, moderate and
   strong sand storms, to explore the responses of sand storms of different
   intensities to soil moisture. Some experiments were conducted in two
   scenarios: scenario A was simulated only by WRF-Chem, and scenario B was
   designed by replacing the initial soil moisture field in WRF-Chem with
   soil moisture satellite data from AMSR2 and AMSR-E. Comparing the
   simulation results with in-situ ground-based and satellite-based
   measurements indicates that WRF-Chem can capture strong sand storms and
   some moderate sand storms, but the ability to simulate weak sand storms
   needs to be greatly improved. After introducing remote sensing soil
   moisture data into WRF-Chem, the simulation of sand emissions becomes
   more accurate, substantially improving the simulation results. Among the
   ten simulated sand storms, the AOD (aerosol optical depth) and PM10
   simulation accuracies are improved for five and seven sand storms,
   respectively. After this improvement, the AOD correlation coefficient
   can reach 0.63, and the PM10 correlation coefficient can reach 0.60.},

Title = {Effect of vegetation index choice on soil moisture retrievals via the
   synergistic use of synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {47-57},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) satellite constellation has provided high-quality SAR data
   with fine spatial and temporal sampling characterizations (6(similar
   to)12 revisit days at 10 m spatial resolution). When combined with
   high-resolution optical remote sensing, this data can potentially be
   used for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over vegetated areas.
   However, the suitability of different vegetation index (VI) types for
   the parameterization of vegetation water content in SAR vegetation
   scattering models requires further investigation. In this study, the
   widely-used physical-based Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is
   coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for the retrieval of
   field-scale soil moisture. Three different VIs (NDVI, EVI, and LAI)
   produced by two different satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) are selected to examine their
   impact on the parameterization of vegetation water content, and
   subsequently, on soil moisture retrieval accuracy. Results indicate
   that, despite the different sensitivity of estimated surface roughness
   parameters to various VIs (i.e., this sensitivity is highest when
   utilizing MODIS EVI and lowest in the LAI-based model), the optimum
   roughness parameters derived from each VI exhibit no discernible
   difference. Consequently, the soil moisture retrieval accuracies show no
   noticeable sensitivity to the choice of a particular VI. Generally,
   meadow and grassland sites with small differences in VIderived roughness
   parameters exhibit good performance in soil moisture estimation. With
   respect to the relative components in the coupled model, the vegetative
   contribution to the scattering signal exceeds that of soil at VI about
   0.6 similar to 0.8 {[}-] in NDVI-based models and 0.4 similar to 0.6
   {[}-] in EVI-based models. This study provides insight into the proper
   selection of vegetation indices during the use of SAR and optical
   imagery for the retrieval of high-resolution surface soil moisture.},

Title = {Statistical modelling of drought-related yield losses using soil
   moisture-vegetation remote sensing and multiscalar indices in the
   south-eastern Europe},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {236},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Meteorological and agricultural information coupled with remote sensing
   observations has been used to assess the effectiveness of
   satellite-derived indices in yield estimations. The estimate yield
   models generated by both the regression (MLR) and Bayesian network (BBN)
   algorithms and their levels of predictive skill were assessed. The
   enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), soil water index (SWI), standardized
   precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) have been considered predictors
   for three rainfed crops (maize, sunflower and grapevine) grown in 37
   districts in the Republic of Moldova (RM). We used the weekly EVI2,
   which was collected by MODIS instruments aboard the Terra satellite with
   a 250m x 250m spatial resolution and aggregated for each district during
   the 2000-2018 period. We also used the weekly SWI, which was collected
   from the ASCAT instruments with a 12 km x 12 km spatial resolution and
   aggregated for each district at the topsoil (0-40 cm; SWI-12) and the
   root-zone layer (0-100 cm; SWI-14) during 2000-2018. The multiscalar
   SPEI during 1951-2018 farming years proved to be a significant addition
   to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that
   improved the yield assessment. The study also summarized (i) the optimal
   time window of satellite-derived SWIi and EVI2i for yield estimation,
   and (ii) the capability of remotely sensed indices for representing the
   spatio-temporal variations of agricultural droughts. We developed
   statistical soil-vegetation-atmosphere models to explore drought-related
   yield losses. The skill scores of the sunflower MLR and BBN models were
   higher than those for the maize and grape models and were able to
   estimate yields with reasonable accuracy and predictive power. The
   accurate estimation of maize, sunflower and grapevine yields was
   observed two months before the harvest (RMSE of similar to 1.2 tha-1).
   Despite the fact that summer crops (maize, sunflower) are able to
   develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth, however, the
   SWI-12 had the stronger correlation with crop yield, then SWI-14. This
   explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and SWI-12,
   which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil.
   In any case, all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of
   the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the
   growing season, with SWI-12 performing better than SWI-14. Based on the
   crop-specific soil moisture model, we found that topsoil moisture
   declines in the most drought-susceptible crop growth stages, which
   indicates that RM is a good candidate for studying drought persists as
   main driver of rainfed yield losses in the south-eastern Europe.},

   Belief Network in the Naqu Region of the Tibetan Plateau},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2021},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in the land surface model. In this
   paper, a method of using VV polarization Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat
   optical data to retrieve soil moisture data was proposed by combining
   the water cloud model (WCM) and the deep belief network (DBN). Since the
   simple combination of training data in the neural network cannot
   effectively improve the accuracy of the soil moisture inversion results,
   a WCM physical model was used to eliminate the effect of vegetation
   cover on the ground backscatter, in order to obtain the bare soil
   backscatter coefficient. This improved the correlation of ground soil
   backscatter characteristics with soil moisture. A DBN soil moisture
   inversion model based on the bare soil backscatter coefficients as the
   foundation training data combined with radar incidence angle and terrain
   factors obtained good inversion results. Studies in the Naqu area of the
   Tibetan Plateau showed that vegetation cover had a significant effect on
   the soil moisture, and the goodness of fit (R-2) between the backscatter
   coefficient and soil moisture before and after the elimination of
   vegetation cover was 0.38 and 0.50, respectively. The correlation
   between the backscatter coefficient and the soil moisture was improved
   after eliminating the vegetation cover. The inversion results of the DBN
   soil moisture model were further improved through iterative parameters.
   The model prediction reached its highest level of accuracy when the
   restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was set to seven layers, the bias and
   R were 0.007 and 0.88, respectively. Ten-fold cross-validation showed
   that the DBN soil moisture model performed stably with different data.
   The prediction was further improved when the bare soil backscatter
   coefficient was used as the training data. The mean values of the root
   mean square error (RMSE), the inequality coefficient (TIC), and the mean
   absolute percent error (MAPE) were 0.023, 0.09, and 11.13, respectively.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the temporal and spatial variation of soil properties is
   helpful to understand the evolution of soil properties and adjust the
   management method in time. Soil fertility evaluation is an urgent need
   to understand soil fertility level and prevent soil degradation. Here,
   we conducted an intensive field investigation in Chinese hickory (Carya
   cathayensis Sarg.) plantation to clarify the spatial and temporal
   variation of soil properties and its influencing factors, and to
   evaluate the change of soil fertility. The results showed that the soil
   pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly increased from 2008 to
   2018, while available nitrogen (AN) significantly decreased from 2008 to
   2018. The semi-variance revealed that except available phosphorus (AP),
   the spatial dependencies of soil properties increased from 2008 to 2018.
   An increasing south-north gradient was found for soil AN, AP, available
   potassium (AK) and SOC and a decreasing south-north gradient was found
   for soil pH. The average soil fertility in the whole area was increased
   from 2008 to 2018. Our findings demonstrated that the changes of the

Abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Interferometric Reflectometry
   (GNSS-IR) is an emerging remote sensing technique studied and
   demonstrated for soil moisture retrieval over bare soil using multipath
   GNSS data. However, retrieval of soil moisture in the presence of
   vegetation/crops is still a very challenging task even becoming a more
   complex problem without using any ancillary datasets to compensate the
   vegetation effect for soil moisture retrievals in higher crop growth
   stages. This paper presents a novel multipath phase -based vegetation
   correction scheme for improved field -scale soil moisture retrieval
   using L -band data from Navigation with Indian Constellations (NavIC)
   based on GNSS-IR technique. The proposed three steps vegetation
   correction scheme categorized the crop as per growth stages for
   sensitivity analysis of NavIC derived multipath phase as GNSS-IR
   observables and significantly compensated vegetation effects on
   multipath phase for improved soil moisture retrievals. The proposed
   method utilized only multipath phase data as single SNR metrics without
   any ancillary data sets and validated during complete growth cycle of
   winter wheat crop (sowing to harvesting stages). It has been shown that
   the soil moisture retrieved using proposed vegetation correction scheme
   provides a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 and ubRMSD of 0.0341
   m 3 /m 3 with in situ measured soil moisture, which is better than bare
   scheme with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and ubRMSD of 0.0480
   m 3 /m 3 . Overall, proposed scheme has found highly effective for
   vegetation correction and has shown a good potential candidate for VSM
   retrievals over crop -covered soil using other GNSS constellations (GPS,
   GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou etc.). (c) 2024 COSPAR. Published by

Title = {The use of remote sensing indices to understand flood-recharged soil
   moisture impacts on trees in semi-arid floodplains: A review},
Journal = {ECOHYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Remote sensing indices (RSIs) are essential for detection, mapping and
   monitoring of floods, soil moisture and tree characteristics. An
   understanding of the nexus between flood-recharged soil moisture (FRSM)
   and endangered biodiversity tree hotspots in semi-arid floodplains is
   critical. Specifically, the influence of FRSM on biophysical
   characteristics of keystone tree species with social, economic,
   ecological and environmental functions is crucial. However, the use of
   RSIs to understand the link between episodic floods, FRSM and trees, as
   well as their respective spatiotemporal dynamics within the semi-arid
   floodplains, remains largely unexplored. Hence, this study reviewed
   literature on the adoption of RSIs in understanding short-term
   phenological and long-term tree structural changes arising from
   flood-related infiltration. The reviewed literature shows the
   predominance of the normalised difference water index, the land surface
   water index and normalised difference vegetation index for flood, FRSM
   and tree mapping. The review also shows the emergence of SAR-based
   normalised difference flood index for understanding the impacts of FRSM
   on riparian trees. Although the review identified an increase in data
   availability, however, there are high costs of active commercial remote
   sensing data of superior quality and computing resources. Furthermore,
   available free data are incapable of penetrating canopies and have
   coarse spatial resolution constraining the use of RSIs to understand the
   impacts of FRSM on trees. In view of increasing free SAR data and
   cloud-based computing resources, application of emerging deep learning
   algorithms offers prospects for the use of RSIs to understand the
   impacts of FRSM on riparian trees.},

Title = {Monitoring hydrological changes with satellite data: Spring thaw's
   effect on soil moisture and groundwater in seasonal Freezing-Thawing
   zones},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Due to the dense vegetation coverage in mountainous areas and
   difficulties in field monitoring in mid-high-latitude freezing-thawing
   zones, satellite and remote sensing technologies can be used to monitor
   long-term global hydrological changes. This study uses multiple
   satellite data of snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture (SM), and
   groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) to analyse their spatial-temporal
   changes in the seasonal freezing-thawing Tumen River Basin. Water
   transformation during the thawing period is determined through
   groundwater level fluctuations and correlation analysis methods; thus,
   the recharge effects of snowmelt and seasonally frozen soil thawing on
   soil moisture and groundwater are identified. The snow begins to melt in
   February, and snow water equivalent decreases gradually from upstream to
   downstream after reaching the peak. Furthermore, seasonally frozen soil
   melts gradually from March. Soil moisture downstream is higher than that
   in the upper and middle reaches. Additionally, the GWSA increases
   gradually in the thawing period, which is high in mountainous areas and
   low in plains. The Spearman correlation coefficient among Delta SWE,
   Delta SM, and Delta GWSA is more significant than 0.5 and dependent on
   altitude. With snow and frozen soil melting, vertical infiltration and
   meltwater percolation increase soil moisture and GWSA. This phenomenon
   is predominant at low altitudes (<600 m) and pore phreatic groundwater
   in the middle and lower reaches. However, snowmelt is the dominant
   factor in groundwater recharge at high-altitude upper reaches. For
   seasonal freezing-thawing zones, a close water transformation was
   observed between snow melting, soil water thawing, and groundwater in
   spring. Thus, the environmental and ecological impact of spring snowmelt
   and floods in freezing-thawing zones can be monitored using multi-source
   data.},

Abstract = {Plant health monitoring is a very significant task in any
   agriculture-based environment. The Internet of Things (IoT) plays an
   important role in the monitoring of plant diseases. IoT is required to
   obtain data through sensor nodes for finding soil moisture and heat
   level. Even though different methods are available to monitor the health
   of plants, observing heat level and soil moisture still results a
   complex task. Thus, this paper introduces a novel chimp shuffled
   shepherd optimization (ChSSO) by the integration of chimp optimization
   algorithm (ChOA) and shuffled shepherd optimization (SSOA) to perform
   the selection of cluster head (CH) and routing process. The proposed
   ChSSO is trained using the deep LSTM which is developed for predicting
   soil moisture and heat level conditions in IoT network to monitor the
   health of plants. The proposed method obtained higher performance by the
   metrics, like testing accuracy and precision of 0.937, and 0.926 for 100
   nodes and the values of 0.940, and 0.940 for 150 nodes using the LDAS

Title = {Evaluation of Multi-Source Soil Moisture Datasets over Central and
   Eastern Agricultural Area of China Using In Situ Monitoring Network},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Multi-source soil moisture (SM) products provide a vigorous tool for the
   estimation of soil moisture on a large scale, but it is crucial to carry
   out the evaluation of those products before further application. In the
   present work, an evaluation framework on multi-source SM datasets over
   central and eastern agricultural areas of China was firstly proposed,
   based on a dense in situ SM monitoring network of 838 stations from 11
   July 2012 to 31 December 2017. Each station adopted the most accurate
   gravimetric method for measuring the actual soil moisture. The effects
   of land use types and wet-dry conditions on the performances of
   multi-source SM products were further analyzed. Most
   satellite/reanalysis SM products could capture the spatial-temporal
   changes in soil moisture, especially for ERA5 products that matched the
   closest to the station-measured SM; by contrast, those satellite
   products showed poor spatial-temporal performances. Such phenomenon was
   also quantitatively demonstrated by the four statistical metrics
   correlation coefficient (CC), p-value, bias and root mean squared error
   (RMSE) between the satellite/reanalysis SM products and the
   ground-observed SM series. Further, most satellite/reanalysis SM
   products had poor performances in Forestland and Grassland areas, with a
   lower CC and a larger positive bias and RMSE. Such overestimation on
   soil moisture is possibly influenced by the inestimable parameter
   vegetation geometry and the vegetation water content in the radiative
   transfer models. The arid areas showed the worst CC between the
   station-observed SM data and different satellite/reanalysis SM products;
   meanwhile, the humid and semi-arid areas presented larger SM estimation
   errors than the other areas, especially for the satellite products. The
   fairly dry surface soil (arid area) and open water surface contamination
   (humid area) are suggested to hinder the reading of microwave-based
   retrieval systems. Additionally, the reanalysis SM products outperformed
   the satellite SM products in the evaluated areas, with better
   spatial-temporal performances, seasonality reflection and higher
   accuracy on SM estimation (higher CC, and lower bias and RMSE). This is
   because the reanalysis datasets assimilated various sources of datasets,
   especially the ground-observed data, with high quality. The evaluated
   results could provide guidance for fusing different satellite/reanalysis
   products, as a new feasible alternative to monitoring SM information in
   the future.},

   Quantitative Index (TVQI) and exponential filtering: A case study in
   Beijing},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {252},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {In this study, to understand the variation trend of soil moisture in
   Beijing, surface soil moisture retrieval, deep soil moisture estimation
   and spatiotemporal distribution characteristics from 2013 to 2014 were
   analyzed. The results showed that the Temperature Vegetation
   Quantitative Index (TVQI), which was modified from the TVDI by the
   quantitative dry edge and wet edge, is effective for predicting surface
   soil moisture. The coefficient of determination (R2), root man squared
   error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of the
   TVQI increased by 0.2, 0.3\%, and 4.6, respectively, compared to those
   of the TVDI. Moreover, the TVQI is closely related to cumulative
   precipitation within 1 month, as the correlation is the highest in this
   time interval. The accuracy of surface soil moisture retrieval was good,
   with relative error (RE), R2, and NSE values of 6\%, 0.9 and 0.7,
   respectively. The deep soil moisture estimations performed well at both
   20 cm and 40 cm, with an average R2 above 0.9, an average RE below 0.1
   and an average NSE above 0.7. However, the prediction accuracy decreased
   as the soil depth increased. Topt, the best characteristic time length
   of the exponential filter, was significantly related to the soil bulk
   density, while the precipitation meteorological condition had little
   effect. Moreover, the average Topt of all stations can be used instead
   of the Topt of each station. Beijing, the study area, is dry throughout
   the year, with soil moisture reaching a minimum in May and a maximum in
   July. The changes in soil moisture at 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm were
   consistent, and soil moisture increased with soil depth. Furthermore,
   the variation trends of soil moisture were high in the east and low in
   the west. Not only is this study important for understanding soil
   moisture variation trends; it also provides a preliminary reference for
   water management in Beijing.},

Abstract = {Plant health monitoring is crucial in ensuring a constant food supply to
   satisfy the growing demand for food. Hence, it is essential to monitor
   plant health to maximize the yield and minimize the risk of various
   diseases. Soil moisture and temperature are of critical importance in
   plant growth, and predicting them enables farmers to take preventive
   actions, thereby mitigating the issues affecting plant health. This work
   presents a plant health monitoring approach by forecasting soil moisture
   and heat levels by collecting data in an Internet of Things (IoT)
   environment. Here, for transmitting the soil data acquired by the IoT
   nodes, a cluster head (CH) selection and routing technique using Gannet
   Namib beetle optimization (GNBO) is used. The data is routed to a
   prediction module, wherein soil moisture and heat levels are predicted
   by Convolutional long short term memory (Conv-LSTM). Furthermore, the
   hyperparameters of the Conv-LSTM are optimized by the GNBO algorithm.
   The efficiency of the GNBO-Conv-LSTM is examined based on link life time
   (LLT), energy, delay, distance, negative predictive value (NPV),
   positive predictive value (PPV), and true negative rate (TNR) and is
   observed to have achieved values of 0.675, 0.478 J, 0.092 ms, 50.200 m,
   0.885, 0.882, and 0.875, correspondingly.},

Title = {Simulating medium-term effects of cropping system diversification on
   soil fertility and crop productivity in southern Africa},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Diversification of cropping is perceived as a strategy to simultaneously
   achieve high productivity and maintain environmental sustainability. In
   southern Africa, however, due to a lack of medium to long-term field
   trials, there is missing quantitative information. Utilising the
   capability of agro-ecosystem models to quantify the interactions of crop
   productivity with management and environmental variables, the APSIM
   model was evaluated against six and an eight-year field trial datasets
   comprised of different crop rotations and fertiliser rates under two
   contrasting agro-ecological conditions in South Africa (clay soil with a
   mean rainfall of 871 mm versus a sandy soil with a 570 mm rainfall).
   Model output was compared to observed grain yield, aboveground dry
   matter, soil organic carbon (SOC), and mineral nitrogen (N-min)
   dynamics. APSIM was able to reproduce the observed grain yield dynamics
   fairly well as indicated by a Wilmott index of agreement of 0.90.
   Prediction accuracy, as indicated by the absolute model error across all
   crops, however, only reached 39\%. Simulated N-min and SOC dynamics
   showed similar patterns to the observations.
   Subsequently, the model was applied in a ten-year simulation experiment
   with rotation treatments (14 rotations, respectively intercropping
   systems, including a maize monoculture control), fertiliser levels (zero
   and 70 kg N ha(-1)), and residue management (retained and removed) for
   the two sites. For low input systems, such as smallholder farms, residue
   management and legume integration are of the utmost importance to
   maintain SOC and more pronounced N-min levels, which, for the sandy
   soil, resulted in an average maize yield increase of up to 1000 kg
   ha(-1). Maize monoculture treatments with residues removed reduced SOC
   moderately by 0.04-0.08 \%, while yields declined strongly (> 1000 kg
   ha(-1)) over the simulated period of ten years. In commercial,
   fertilised cropping systems, allocating land to cultivate crops other
   than maize reduced the simulated total yield performance. This
   diversification disadvantage has to be considered against the benefits
   of increased SOC and yields in the medium-term, i.e. a period of ten
   years. For the commercial systems, maize intercropped with delayed sown
   oats or cowpea appeared promising.},

Title = {Effects of rainwater harvesting system on soil moisture in rain-fed
   orchards on the Chinese Loess Plateau},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {243},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Rainwater is a primary water source for the hilly and gully region of
   the Loess Plateau where an improved efficiency of rainwater utilization
   is crucial for sustainable agricultural development. A new system,
   comprised of rainwater harvesting, concentrating infiltration with
   multi-holed pipe and mulching (RIM), was designed to sustain soil
   moisture at a proper level in rain-fed orchards in the hilly and gully
   loess region of China. This study monitored changes in soil moisture and
   distribution over soil profiles using four treatments: (a) RIM1 with two
   rainwater harvesting areas, two infiltration pipes and film mulching,
   (b) RIM2 with one rainwater harvesting area, one infiltration pipe and
   film mulching, (c) film mulching (FM) only and (d) traditional apple
   orchard as a control treatment (CK) as a baseline in this experiment.
   The results showed that mean soil moisture content (SMC) in a range of
   soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for RIM1 and RIM2 treatments
   increased by 43.01\% and 34.78\% in 2018 and 30.55\% and 26.41\% in
   2019, respectively. Dividing the soil vertical profile into three
   layers, i.e., an easy-changing layer (0-60 cm), an increasing or
   decreasing layer (60-180 cm), and a relatively steady layer (180-300
   cm), this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture. The RIM1
   and RIM2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of
   wetted areas over the whole soil layers. The soil moisture was
   replenished to a horizontal distance of 1.5 m and 2.5 m apart from the
   trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the RIM1
   treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1.5 m apart from the
   trunk under the RIM2 treatment. While the seasonal variation of SMC in
   the easy-changing soil layer (0-60 cm) corresponded to precipitation
   consistently, the SMC in the deep soil layers (60-300 cm) was not
   sensitive to precipitation. As a result, the treatments of RIM1, RIM2
   and FM improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with
   those under the control treatment. In particular, the RIM1 treatment
   performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study. The
   results highlighted the efficiency of the RIM system in enhancing the
   soil moisture, which may be useful to improve an orchard production for
   rain-fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of China.},

Abstract = {Precipitation is an important forcing for land surface models (LSMs).
   Various types of precipitation data sets are available based on
   satellites, rain gauges, merged data sets, as well as analysis products.
   This study evaluates the uncertainty in soil moisture estimates using
   the five different forcing precipitation data sets from the: Global Data
   Assimilation System (GDAS), Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission
   (TRMM)-Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), Precipitation
   Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural
   Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Global Precipitation
   Mission (GPM), and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data
   over the Indian domain using the Noah land surface model within the NASA
   Land Information System (LIS). The simulations are conducted using the
   five different precipitation data sets over the Indian subcontinent for
   3 years from 2012-2014. Except for the rainfall forcing, the simulation
   environment was retained identical for each of the five simulations in
   terms of model configuration and physics. The simulation results are
   compared with the weekly soil moisture station data available from the
   IMD for different depths. Results indicate that the LIS-Noah soil
   moisture estimates forced with IMD rainfall agreed better among the five
   simulations with IMD in situ data. The simulated output soil moisture
   using IMD as precipitation data has the lowest soil moisture RMSE for
   all 3 years as compared to other simulations, while the GPM forced
   simulation has a higher RMSE value for all 3 years. The correlation
   coefficients of simulated soil moisture outputs with respect to
   different in situ stations show that, among the five simulations, IMD
   forced simulation has a higher correlation coefficient for the majority
   of stations for the years 2012 and 2013, while for the year 2014, GPM
   forced simulation shows better results. The correlation coefficient
   between the PERSIANN-CDR forced simulation output and in situ stations
   shows poor results as compared to other products. IMD gridded rainfall
   forced simulation is superior to the other four precipitation forced
   simulations in all study areas and could be used in the future for
   hydrological and meteorological models.},

Journal = {AGROFORESTRY SYSTEMS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {96},
Number = {4},
Pages = {747-757},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pruning tree roots in alley cropping systems (ACS) could reduce
   underground competition and thus increase crop productivity. However,
   these management operations impose a stress on the trees, increase
   production costs and given the complexity of ACS; they may not lead to
   an increase in crop yield. Thus, the objective of this study was to
   measure the impact of root pruning in a Mediterranean ACS on soil water
   content and on the yield of two varieties each of barley and durum
   wheat. To achieve this, an experiment with three different treatments
   was conducted: monocrop (MC), and two 23-year-old hybrid walnut ACS,
   with (ACS\_RP +) and without (ACS\_RP-) root pruning. In each system,
   grain yield and yield components were measured and the microclimate and
   soil water content were recorded during the growing season. The ACS had
   lower incident radiation in the understory than MC and this radiation
   was unevenly distributed along the alley. Besides, ACS had lower air
   temperature during the day and higher at night in comparison with MC.
   Also, soil water content was higher in ACS than in MC. Within ACS, the
   soil water content was similar until the tree budburst but thereafter
   lower in ACS\_RP-. The grain yield of both cereals was lower in ACS than
   in MC. Among the ACS there were no differences in grain yield or in any
   yield component for both cereals. From the above, it can be concluded
   that, under the conditions presented in the study, the root pruning
   increased the water available for the crops, but this did not increase
   crop yield. It is inferred that the main limiting factor for grain yield
   in the studied ACS was other than soil water.},

Abstract = {Rainfall is the major component of the hydrologic cycle and it is the
   primary source of runoff. The main purpose of this study was to estimate
   daily discharge by employing an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System
   (ANFIS) model using rainfall and soil moisture data at three different
   depths (5 cm, 100 cm and bedrock) for the Damanganga basin. The length
   of the data for the study period 1983-2022 is 39 years. The model
   employed nine membership functions for each variable of soil moisture,
   rainfall, discharge and 30 rules were optimized. The results were
   compared considering a range of model performance indicators as
   correlation coefficient (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)
   coefficient. The model application results shows that soil moisture at
   bedrock gives more precise value of daily discharge with (R-2) and NSE
   value as 0.9936 and 0.9981, respectively, as compared to the soil
   moisture at a depth of 5 and 100 cm. The better results obtained for the
   measurement of soil moisture in the deeper soil layer are consistent
   with the hydrological behavior anticipated for the analyzed catchment,
   where the root-zone soil layer is the driver of the runoff response
   rather than the surface observations. This study can be helpful to
   hydrologists in selecting appropriate rainfall-runoff models.},

Abstract = {We evaluate the soil moisture hindcasts and the reconstruction runs
   giving the hindcasts initial conditions in version 2.1 of the Canadian
   Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPSv2.1). Different
   strategies are used to initialize the hindcasts for the two CanSIPSv2.1
   models, CanCM4i and the coupled Global Environmental Multiscale, version
   5.1, (GEM5)-NEMO model (GEM5-NEMO), with contrasting impacts on the soil
   moisture initial conditions and forecast performance. Forecast
   correlation skill is decomposed into contributions from persistence of
   the initial anomalies and contributions not linked to persistence, with
   performance largely driven by the accuracy of the initial conditions in
   regions of strong persistence. Seasonal soil moisture correlation skill
   is significant for several months into the hindcasts depending on
   initial and target months, with contributions not linked to persistence
   becoming more notable at longer lead times. For the first 2-4 months,
   the quality of CanSIPSv2.1 ensemble mean forecasts tends to be higher on
   average during summer and fall and is comparable to that of the best
   performing model, whereas CanSIPSv2.1 outperforms the single models
   during spring and winter. For longer lead times, remote climate
   influences from the Pacific Ocean are notable and contribute to
   predictable soil moisture variability in teleconnected regions.},

Abstract = {The soil moisture contents affect significantly the soil thermal
   properties and consequently the thermal efficiency of shallow geothermal
   systems. This effect becomes more complex to be evaluated for an
   Earth-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) because of its non-stable energy
   performance due to a large fluctuation of the temperature of air. In
   this study, the impact of soil moisture content and soil thermal
   properties has been investigated on the long-term energy performance of
   an instrumented EAHE site. First, a full-scale experimental EAHE site in
   University of Strasbourg as well as its measured data are presented. The
   thermal properties of different soil layers present in the site were
   experimentally and theoretically characterized with different soil
   moisture contents. Based on these results, an analytical solution was
   proposed to simulate the soil temperature of the field and the output
   air temperature of the EAHE. A computer program based on this analytical
   solution was developed to assess the performance of the system for a
   period of three years. The numerical calculation was validated for an
   average saturation condition by comparing simulation results with
   measured data. Different soil saturation conditions were also used in
   the numerical simulation to consider the effect of soil moisture on the
   system performance. The results show that if the turbulent flow of the
   circulating air is fully developed, the difference of the exchanged
   energy could reach more than 40\%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Employing NDVI as vegetation correction variable to improve soil
   moisture measurements of mobile cosmic-ray neutron sensor near the
   Qilian Mountains},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {441},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) are a powerful tool for measuring soil
   moisture on a hectometer scale, and mobile cosmic-ray neutron technology
   holds significant importance for upscaling soil moisture. However,
   vegetation strongly affects with CRNS soil moisture measurements.
   Variations in vegetation over time change how the CRNS is affected,
   which is more challenging than a stable vegetation cover, particularly
   during CRNS roving, where one crosses many vegetation covers. To correct
   vegetation, we hypothesized that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index
   (NDVI) can represent vegetation hydrogen pools. From 2020 to 2023, at
   the 74 plots with varying vegetation cover near the Qilian Mountains,
   the experiments for soil moisture measurements were conducted in shrubs,
   forests, deserts, farmlands, and grasslands using a Cosmic-ray Neutron
   Rover. The measured neutron intensity clearly varied across different
   landscapes, and the calibrated parameter N0 differed among 74 plots. The
   variations in vegetation cover resulted in low measurement accuracy for
   CRNS. All three NDVI vegetation correction methods (NDVI-theta NDVI
   method, NDVI-NDVIave method, and NDVI-N0 method) offered by the study
   could improve accuracy of soil moisture measurements. In the optimal
   NDVI-N0 method, the relationship between NDVI and N0 was established
   using a power function y = 373.9 (x + 0.015)-0.136 (R2 = 0.77), which
   had the capability to decrease the root mean square error between
   oven-dried and measured soil moisture from 0.093 to 0.032 g g-1 in our
   study area. Employing NDVI instead of biomass for CRNS vegetation
   correction can substantially reduce workload and effectively enhance
   CRNS soil moisture measurements, showing the potential for upscaling
   soil moisture.},

Title = {Irrigation characterization improved by the direct use of SMAP soil
   moisture anomalies within a data assimilation system},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Prior soil moisture data assimilation (DA) efforts to incorporate human
   management features such as agricultural irrigation has only shown
   limited success. This is partly due to the fact that observational
   rescaling approaches for bias correction used in soil moisture DA
   systems are less effective when unmodeled processes such as irrigation
   are the dominant source of systematic biases. In this article, we
   demonstrate an alternative approach, i.e. anomaly correction for
   overcoming this limitation. Unlike the rescaling approaches, the
   proposed method does not scale remote sensing soil moisture retrievals
   to the model climatology, but it extracts the temporal variability
   information from the retrievals. The study demonstrates this approach
   through the assimilation of soil moisture retrievals from the Soil
   Moisture Active Passive mission into the Noah land surface model. The
   results demonstrate that DA using the anomaly correction method can
   better capture the effect of irrigation on soil moisture in agricultural
   areas while providing comparable performance to the DA integrations
   using rescaling approaches in non-irrigated areas. These findings
   emphasize the need to reduce inconsistencies between remote sensing and
   the models so that assimilation methods can employ information from
   remote sensing more directly to develop representations of unmodeled
   processes such as irrigation.},

   Availability in the Rice-Wheat System},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The indiscriminate use of chemical fertilizers can deteriorate soil,
   grain, and environmental quality; still, these can be restored if
   integrated nutrient management options with inclusion of legumes in the
   cropping system are adopted. A long-term (19 year) rice-wheat system
   experiment was examined to find out the best nutrient management
   practices (BNMP) through recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF),
   integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS), soil test crop response
   (STCR), farmyard manure (FYM), along with the inclusion of pulses
   (berseem and cowpea). Seven nutrient management practices were applied
   in combination of organic and chemical fertilizer in the rice-wheat
   system. Results showed that a significant variation was seen in
   phosphorus (P) fractions among the treatments and soil depths. The
   results showed a significantly (p < 0.05) higher contribution to
   phosphorus availability by Residual-P followed by NaHCO3-Po > NaOH-Pi >
   NaOH-Po > HCl-P > NaHCO3-Pi > available P and lowest in WSP under
   different long-term management options in rice-wheat system after
   completing 19 crop cycles. Variations in soil P-fractions with depth
   were compared to different treatment combination, and a considerable
   increase in all the major P-fractions was noticed. The continuous
   application of various IPNS options as organic farming (OF), RDF, STCR,
   and the inclusion of pulses (berseem and cowpea) significantly improved
   all P fractions in the soil system and offered an added benefit in terms
   of sustainability of production and soil health compared to the solo
   application of chemical fertilizers. Overall, results showed that IPNS
   options (berseem and cowpea) showed its superiority over the rest of the
   treatment. This study suggests that the inclusion of pulses would
   increase P-availability in soil system.},

   decomposition of organic components of straw and soil fertility},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL 29},
Abstract = {In view of the problems of low straw decomposition rates and reduced
   soil fertility in southern Liaoning, China, we investigated the effects
   of no-tillage mode (NT), deep loosening+deep rotary tillage mode (PT),
   rotary tillage mode (RT) and the addition of decomposing agent (the next
   is called a decomposer) (NT+S, PT+S, RT+S) on the decomposition
   proportion of straw, respectively, by using the nylon net bag method in
   combination with 365-day field plot experiments. The decomposition rules
   of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin as well as the dynamics of soil
   organic carbon (SOC), soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and soil
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) in straw returned to the field for 15,
   35, 55, 75, 95, 145 and 365 days were analyzed. The results showed that
   in the short term, the decomposition of straw was better in both the
   rotray tillage and deep loosening+deep rotary modes than in the
   no-tillage mode, and the addition of decomposer significantly promoted
   the decomposition of straw and the release of carbon from straw, among
   them, the RT+S treatment had the highest straw decomposition proportion
   and carbon release proportion in all sampling periods. After a one year
   experimental cycle, the RT+S treatment showed the highest proportion of
   cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin decomposition with 35.49\%, 84.23\%
   and 85.50\%, respectively, and soil SOC, MBC and DOC contents were also
   higher than the other treatments with an increase of 2.30 g kg(-1),
   14.22 mg kg(-1) and 25.10 mg kg(-1), respectively, compared to the
   pre-experimental soil. Our results show that in the short term, to
   accelerate the decomposition rate of returned straw and increase the
   content of various forms of carbon in soil, rotary tillage can be used
   to return the straw to the field, while also spraying straw decomposer
   on its surface. This experiment used a new straw decomposer rich in a
   variety of microorganisms, combined with the comparison of a variety of
   straw return modes, and in-depth study of straw decomposition effects of
   cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Thus, a scheme that can effectively
   improve the decomposition rate of straw and the content of various forms
   of organic carbon in soil within a short period of time was explored to
   provide theoretical support for the southern Liaoning.},

Abstract = {Soil microbial respiration is one of the largest sources of carbon (C)
   emissions to the atmosphere in terrestrial ecosystems, which is strongly
   dependent on multiple environmental variables including soil moisture.
   Soil moisture content is strongly dependent on soil texture, and the
   combined effects of texture and moisture on microbial respiration are
   complex and less explored. Therefore, this study examines the effects of
   soil moisture on the mineralization of soil organic C Soil organic
   carbon in three different soils, Ultisol, Alfisol and Vertisol,
   collected from mixed forests of Georgia, Missouri, and Texas, United
   States , respectively. A laboratory microcosm experiment was conducted
   for 90 days under different moisture regimes. Soil respiration was
   measured weekly, and destructive harvests were conducted at 1, 15, 60,
   and 90 days after incubation to determine extractable organic C (EOC),
   phospholipid fatty acid based microbial community, and C-acquiring
   hydrolytic extracellular enzyme activities (EEA). The highest cumulative
   respiration in Ultisol was observed at 50\% water holding capacity
   (WHC), in Alfisol at 100\% water holding capacity, and in Vertisol at
   175\% WHC. The trends in Extractable Organic Carbon were opposite to
   that of cumulative microbial respiration as the moisture levels showing
   the highest respiration showed the lowest EOC concentration in all soil
   types. Also, extracellular enzyme activities increased with increase in
   soil moisture in all soils, however, respiration and EEA showed a
   decoupled relationship in Ultisol and Alfisol soils. Soil moisture
   differences did not influence microbial community composition.},

Abstract = {The growth of cover crops can contribute to the increase in phosphorus

   verify the effect of cover crops on soil phosphorus availability and use
   by successive plants, and the accumulation of soil P in a no-tillage
   system conducted for 14 years. This research was carried out during the
   2016/2017 and 2017/2018 crop seasons, whose treatments have been
   installed and maintained since 2003. The experimental design was a
   randomized block design, and the plots consisted of spring crops: pearl
   amillet, forage sorghum, sunn hemp, and additionally, a fallow/chiseling
   area. The evaluation of available P was determined by P fractionation.
   In general, in the two years of evaluation, the accumulation of P in the
   shoot dry matter was higher in sunn hemp growth, on average 25\% higher
   than pearl millet in 2016 and 40\% higher than sorghum in 2017. The
   highest contents of labile inorganic P were in the sorghum-soybean and
   fallow/chiseling-soybean successions, with values higher than 50 mg
   kg(-1) of P in the 0-0.1 m soil layer. However, in the other layers
   analyzed, the cover crops obtained higher availability of labile
   inorganic P. The systems using cover crops recovered 100\% of the P

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) is one of the factors affecting plant
   growth. Methods involving direct soil moisture measurement in the field
   or requiring laboratory tests are commonly used. These methods, however,
   are laborious and time-consuming and often give only point-by-point
   results. In contrast, SSM can vary across a field due to uneven
   precipitation, soil variability, etc. An alternative is using satellite
   data, for example, optical data from Sentinel-2 (S2). The main objective
   of this study was to assess the accuracy of SSM determination based on
   S2 data versus standard measurement techniques in three different
   agricultural areas (with irrigation and drainage systems). In the field,
   we measured SSM manually using non-destructive techniques. Based on S2
   data, we estimated SSM using the optical trapezoid model (OPTRAM) and
   calculated eighteen vegetation indices. Using the OPTRAM model gave a
   high SSM estimating accuracy (R-2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.06). The use of soil
   porosity in the OPTRAM model significantly improved the results. Among
   the vegetation indices, at the NDVI <= 0.2, the highest value of R-2 was
   obtained for the STR to OPTRAM index, while at the NDVI > 0.2, the
   shadow index had the highest R-2 comparable with OPTRAM.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged as a reliable method for
   soil moisture and snow estimation. However, the applicability of this
   method beyond research has been limited due to, among others, the use of
   relatively large and expensive sensors. This paper presents the tests
   conducted on a new scintillator-based sensor especially designed to
   jointly measure neutron counts, muons and total gamma rays. The neutron
   signal is first compared against two conventional gas-tube-based CRNS
   sensors at two locations. The estimated soil moisture is further
   assessed at four agricultural sites, based on gravimetric soil moisture
   collected within the sensor footprint. Muon fluxes are compared to the
   incoming neutron variability measured at a neutron monitoring station
   and total gammas counts are compared to the signal detected by a gamma
   ray spectrometer. The results show that the neutron dynamic detected by
   the new scintillator-based CRNS sensor is well in agreement with
   conventional CRNS sensors. The derived soil moisture also agreed well
   with the gravimetric soil moisture measurements. The muons and the total
   gamma rays simultaneously detected by the sensor show promising features
   to account for the incoming variability and for discriminating
   irrigation and precipitation events, respectively. Further experiments
   and analyses should be conducted, however, to better understand the
   accuracy and the added value of these additional data for soil moisture
   estimation. Overall, the new scintillator design shows to be a valid and
   compact alternative to conventional CRNS sensors for non-invasive soil
   moisture monitoring and to open the path to a wide range of
   applications.},

   moisture drought},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Soil moisture drought, as one of the most important drought categories,
   is determined by both water supply (e.g., precipitation) and demand
   (e.g., potential evapotranspiration). To shed light on the underlying
   mechanisms driving soil moisture drought, the statistical multiple
   linear regression, machine learning, and modeling ex-periments methods
   have been pervasively used in early studies. However, these methods
   neglect the collinearity and interactions of climate variables, and thus
   cannot reflect the direct and indirect interaction of factors leading to
   soil moisture drought. To reveal the synergistic effects of water supply
   and demand on soil moisture drought, this study quantified the
   contributions of key drivers to the change of soil moisture drought by a
   path analysis method to exhibit the relationships between atmospheric
   movement state and soil moisture drought. Prior to applying the
   systematic path analysis model, we identified the spatial patterns of
   soil moisture droughts at different depths by using a state-of-art
   three-dimensional drought recognition method in China. Our results
   showed that precipitation deficits dominated the interannual variation
   of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration
   only had marginal intensification in drought. The response of soil
   moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was magnified by
   drought deterioration, especially in basically severe drought
   conditions. The total column water vapor and the horizontal divergence
   of the vapor flux, as well as temperature, directly affected
   precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and led to soil moisture
   drought through various direct and indirect processes. This study
   highlighted that the interactions among precipitation, potential
   evapotranspiration, and atmospheric vapor movement state in space and
   time were important for understanding the drought development
   mechanisms.},

Title = {Shadow removal method of soil surface image based on GAN used for
   estimation of farmland soil moisture content},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {34},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {It is important to obtain soil moisture content (SMC) in farmland, and
   soil surface images can be used to rapidly estimate SMC. The objective
   of this study was to propose a shadow removal algorithm to eliminate the
   effect of shadows in soil surface images, so as to improve the accuracy
   of SMC estimation. The structure of the proposed soil shadow generative
   adversarial networks (SS GAN) was a circulating network, which is an
   unsupervised method and does not require paired shadow image sets for
   network training. Four loss functions were defined for the network to
   effectively remove shadows and ensure texture detail and color
   consistency. This method is compared with traditional methods,
   supervised and unsupervised deep learning techniques by comparative
   experiments. Evaluations were made from visual and quantitative
   comparisons. Visually, the best shadow removal method was proved, it
   almost has no shadow boundaries or shadow areas visible for samples. The
   peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) were
   used to quantitatively compare shadow removal images with real
   non-shadow images. The PSNR and SSIM of SS GAN were 28.46 and 0.95
   respectively, which are superior to other methods, indicating that the
   images processed by SS GAN were closer to the real non-shadow images.
   Field experiments results shown that SS GAN has excellent shadow removal
   performance in the self-developed vehicle-mounted detection system. In
   order to verify the improvement effect of shadow removal image on SMC
   estimation accuracy, further field test was conducted to estimate SMC.
   Compared with SMC estimation results before and after shadow removal,
   R-2 increased from 0.69 to 0.76, and root mean square error decreased
   from 1.39 to 0.94\%. The results show that the proposed method can
   effectively remove the shadow of soil image and improve the accuracy of
   SMC estimation in farmland.},

Title = {A novel land surface temperature reconstruction method and its
   application for downscaling surface soil moisture with machine learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {634},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Downscaling of soil moisture data is important for high resolution
   hydrological modeling. Most downscaling studies in the literature have
   used spatially discontinuous land surface temperature (LST) maps as the
   main auxiliary parameter, which limits the creation of continuous soil
   moisture maps. The number of studies on soil moisture downscaling with
   machine learning that use gapless LST maps is limited. With this
   motivation, a hybrid reconstruction method has been proposed in this
   study to practically obtain continuous LST maps, which are then used to
   produce high resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) datasets. The
   proposed method is shown to have high mean performance with R2 and RMSE
   values of 0.94 and 1.84 degrees K, respectively, for the period between
   2019 and 2022. The developed reconstructed LST maps were then used to
   downscale original 9 km spatial resolution soil moisture datasets of
   SMAP L3 and SMAP L4 with Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm.
   The RF model were run with four different rainfall datasets, and the
   MSWEP rainfall dataset was found to produce the best results. The use of
   antecedent rainfall values as input variables in machine learning models
   has been shown to improve the performance of the models R2 0.76 to 0.93.
   The accuracy of the downscaled data was later evaluated for Western
   Anatolia Basins (WAB) in T \& uuml;rkiye with 31 in-situ stations. The
   downscaled SMAP L4 had good average statistical indicators R (0.815 +/-
   0.1), RMSE (0.09 +/- 0.047 cm3/cm3), and ubRMSE (0.058 +/- 0.025 cm3/
   cm3). Downscaled SMAP L3 was also validated with in-situ observations
   with satisfactory R (0.79 +/- 0.074), RMSE (0.09 +/- 0.043 cm3/cm3), and
   ubRMSE (0.06 +/- 0.026 cm3/cm3) statistics. Furthermore, the performance
   of the downscaled SMAP L3 was also cross validated with SMAP + Sentinel
   1 (L2) dataset between 2019 and 2022. The mean statistics of R (0.761
   +/- 0.11) and Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD) (0.05 +/- 0.014 cm3/
   cm3) between downscaled SMAP L3 and L2 data revealed that the new
   reconstruction method of LST used in the RF model for downscaling of
   soil moisture performed well to obtain high resolution soil moisture
   datasets. The proposed technique also overcame the difficulties
   associated with coastal regions where data was masked for quality
   considerations, by not only enhancing overall spatial resolution but
   also filling these data gaps and giving a complete SSM coverage.},

Title = {Novel Soil Moisture Estimates Combining the Ensemble Kalman Filter Data
   Assimilation and the Method of Breeding Growing Modes},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in climate prediction and drought
   monitoring. Data assimilation, as a method of integrating
   multi-geographic spatial data, plays an increasingly important role in
   estimating soil moisture. Model prediction error, an important part of
   the background field information, occupies a position that could not be
   ignored in data assimilation. The model prediction error in data
   assimilation consists of three parts: forcing data error, initial field
   error, and model error. However, the influence of model error in current
   data assimilation methods has not been completely considered in many
   studies. Therefore, we proposed a theoretical framework of the ensemble
   Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation based on the breeding of growing
   modes (BGM) method. This framework used the BGM method to perturb the
   initial field error term w of EnKF, and the EnKF data assimilation to
   assimilate the data to obtain the soil moisture analysis value. The
   feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework were verified,
   taking into consideration breeding length and ensemble size through
   experiments. We conducted experiments and evaluated the accuracy of the
   BGM and the Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The experiment showed that the BGM
   method could improve the estimation accuracy of the assimilated soil
   moisture and solve the problem of model error which is not fully
   expressed in data assimilation. This study can be widely used in data
   assimilation and has a significant role in weather forecast and drought
   monitoring.},

Title = {A simple method for correcting the effects of initial soil moisture on
   Modified Philip-Dunne Infiltrometer drawdown curves},
Journal = {GROUNDWATER FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The effect of varying initial soil moisture (theta(in)) of a given soil
   on the drawdown curve measured using the Modified Philip-Dunne
   Infiltrometer (MPDI) and consequently on the estimated saturated
   hydraulic conductivity (K-s) value, was investigated. The laboratory
   tests completed using three different types of soil show that the
   drawdown curve was sensitive to theta(in) for all three soils. This
   resulted in yielding K-s values that are sensitive to the values of
   theta(in). The lowest value of K-s was observed when the MPDI was used
   under wet conditions. To obtain a consistent estimate of K-s, a new
   correction factor was developed. This factor can be multiplied with the
   geometrical coefficient used in the governing equations of the MPDI to
   make appropriate corrections. After employing the correction factor, the
   variations in K-s values for all three tested soils decreased from 66\%,
   61\% and 59\%, to 26\%, 16\% and 26\%, respectively. In situ
   experimental tests also show similar results and the coefficient of
   variation decreased from 81\% to 61\% after applying the correction
   factor. The performance was further validated by testing the relative
   performance of the MPDI against the results obtained using Minidisk
   Infiltrometer (MDI) under varying theta(in) values. Results from the MDI
   show that the coefficient of variation for the K-s values of the three
   soils were 20\%, 28\%, and 32\%, which are similar to the variations
   obtained after applying the correction factor in the MPDI model
   calculations. The aforementioned results indicate that the correction
   method proposed in this study is a useful method for improving the
   overall performance of MPDI.},

Title = {A GNSS-IR soil moisture retrieval method via multi-layer perceptron with
   consideration of precipitation and environmental factors},
Journal = {GPS SOLUTIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {28},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring is a significant aspect of environmental and
   agricultural studies, and Global Navigation Satellite System
   Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) has emerged as a promising
   technology for this purpose. Traditionally, GNSS-IR is mainly employed
   for bare soil experiments, and the effectiveness of bare soil retrieval
   algorithm will be reduced due to the influence of vegetation and
   meteorological, etc. To address the limitations of the bare-soil
   retrieval algorithm, a multi-feature soil moisture retrieval approach
   was proposed. This approach integrated multiple factors including GNSS
   signals, cumulative precipitation, effective reflection height, and
   Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI), and then multi-layer
   perceptron (MLP) was employed to build retrieval models. In this study,
   measurements from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) H2O networks and
   a self-built site in Henan, China were used for experiments and
   validation, and the geographical environment of stations are various.
   The experimental results demonstrated several key findings: (1) The
   delay phase is not sensitive to the variations in soil moisture before
   and after precipitation, but by integrating the cumulative precipitation
   data, the accuracy of the model could be improved. (2) The introduction
   of NMRI and reflection height can help remove the influence of
   vegetation and penetration depth. (3) Compared between three retrieval
   models (i.e., unary linear regression, multiple linear regression, and
   MLP), the decrease in the mean absolute error (MAE) of MLP is up to 96\%
   most and the mean coefficient of determination (R2) is all above 0.98.
   Meanwhile, this study proved that the proposed method could fully
   utilize satellite reflection signals from all directions and better
   reflect the fluctuation of soil moisture.},

Title = {Soil moisture assimilation in urban watersheds: A method to identify the
   limiting imperviousness threshold based on watershed characteristics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {587},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Data assimilation is well suited for merging observed and simulated
   values to improve hydrologic forecasts. Typically, observation data that
   is assimilated into hydrologic models can be obtained from in situ
   gauges, radar, and remote sensing. In an urban environment, the benefits
   of soil moisture assimilation are not clearly defined. This work aims to
   identify the feasible imperviousness range a which it is advantageous to
   assimilate remotely sensed soil moisture to improve hydrologic
   forecasting in an urban watershed. A synthetic experiment was set up to
   simulate the retrieval of soil moisture onto a spatial grid and
   assimilate it into a hydrologic model. Subcatchments were set up such
   that they would represent areas within that retrieval grid with varying
   levels of development. Multiple rainfall events were simulated with
   forecasts of up to 12 hours for each sub-catchment. The results of these
   simulations indicate that when areal average soil moisture is
   assimilated into an urban subcatchment model which has a level of
   impervious that exceeds a threshold value, there is a decrease in model
   forecast performance, indicating that soil moisture assimilation is no
   longer beneficial. A quick way to determine the imperviousness threshold
   was then derived using a modified NRCS-CN method which matches the
   results of the synthetic experiments. This methodology was then further
   tested using real-world urban watersheds and shown to be a valid
   approach that can be used to quickly determine whether soil moisture
   assimilation would be beneficial for the watershed of interest. In
   general, this work has shown that hydrologic forecasting in an urban
   watershed can benefit from soil moisture assimilation even when
   imperviousness reaches 65-75\%. Additionally, this work found a quick
   way to validate further if soil moisture assimilation is beneficial
   using some simple watershed characteristics.},

Title = {A synergic method of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for retrieving
   soil moisture content in agricultural regions},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {190},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Remote sensing techniques, which provide timely and accurate soil
   moisture information to improve food production, are becoming
   increasingly popular among agricultural production in China and many
   other regions. It also shows its importance in monitoring agricultural
   basins where the meteorological and topographic con-ditions vary
   greatly. In this case, the reliability of soil moisture content (SMC)
   monitoring for theses basins could be promised. The main objective of
   this paper is to develop a synergic method of radar and optical data, as
   well as an on-site sampling scheme, to accurately estimate SMC in the
   basin. The reason is that in the winter wheat production area of Dawen
   River basin in China, there are few conventional SMC testing equipment.
   Considering the characteristics of different crops and the conditions of
   crops in different growth periods, the VV polarization mode of
   Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images was used to
   retrieve SMC. Combined with the Normalized difference vegetation index
   (NDVI) extracted from Sentinel-2 MSI optical images and the optimized
   Water Cloud Model (WCM), the surface backscattering coefficient was
   obtained by eliminating vegetation moisture content (VMC), and the SMC
   model was established. The results showed that from March to May in
   2020, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the estimated VMC
   and the field observation was 0.655, and the Root Mean Square Error
   (RMSE) between the two was 0.334. In the inversion algorithm model, the
   R-2 be-tween the retrieved SMC and the field measurement was 0.506, and
   the RMSE was 3.725.},

Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},
Number = {2},

Month = {JAN 19},
Abstract = {Understanding groundwater recharge processes is important for
   sustainable water resource management. Experimental approaches to study
   recharge in karst areas often focus on analysing the aquifer response
   using a disintegration of its outlet signals, but only a few approaches
   directly investigate the recharge processes that occur at the surface of
   the system. Soil moisture measurements have a high potential to
   investigate water infiltration to deeper soil depth or epikarst with an
   easy and not too intrusive installation. They can yield long-term
   measurements with high temporal resolution. Using these advantages, we
   developed and tested a method to estimate recharge based on soil
   moisture measurements. The method consists of the extraction of linked
   events in rainfall, soil moisture, and discharge time series, as well as
   a subsequent fitting of the parameters of a simple drainage model to
   calculate karst recharge from soil moisture metrics of individual
   events. The fitted parameters could be interpreted in physically
   meaningful terms and were related to the properties of the karstic
   system. The model was tested and validated in a karst catchment located
   in southwest Germany with hourly precipitation, soil moisture, and
   discharge data of 8 years duration. The soil moisture measurements were
   distributed among grassland (n = 8) and woodland areas (n = 7) at 20 cm
   depth. A threshold of about 35 \% (+/- 8 \%) of volumetric water content
   was necessary to initiate effective infiltration. Soil moisture averaged
   during the wetting period of each event was the best metric for the
   prediction of recharge. The model performed reasonably well, estimating
   recharge during single rainfall events. It was also capable of
   simulating 88 \% of the average annual recharge volume despite
   considerable differences in the performance between years. The
   event-based approach is potentially applicable to other karstic systems
   where soil moisture and precipitation measurements are available to
   predict karst groundwater recharge.},

Abstract = {- The rational use of correctives and fertilizers in banana orchards
   depends on reliable standards for interpreting soil fertility. The study
   aimed to establish critical levels (CL) for phosphorus (P) and potassium
   (K) in the soil of banana plantations in Santa Catarina, using the
   Boundary Line (BL) method. A database with information of soil chemical
   analysis and fruit yield obtained from orchards in producing regions was
   used. Scatter plots were obtained relating P and K concentration in the
   soil extracted by the Mehlich-1 method with the relative productivity of
   fruits and then the pairs of data in the upper border were selected and
   used to establish a mathematical model. The model was derived and
   obtained the concentrations of P and K in the soil that provided the
   maximum physical productivity (100 \%) and maximum economic productivity
   (90\% of the maximum production), corresponding to the CL in the soil.
   It is proposed that the update of critical levels of P and K for banana
   cultivation in Santa Catarina to be 85 and 229 mg/dm3, respectively. The
   banana grower will be able to suppress the P and K doses in a punctual
   and temporary way in areas of built fertility with the proper monitoring

Abstract = {Quantity-intensity curves were used to evaluate the dynamics of soil
   potassium (K) at different soil depths under different K management. The
   equilibrium concentration ratio of K (CR0) increased with increasing K

   layer, respectively, under K fertilization, straw return and the

   significantly increased after K fertilization and straw return. The
   labile K varied from 0.11 to 0.19 cmol kg(-1), contributed 85.3\% to
   107.6\% of NH4OAc extracted K. Soil K potential buffering capacity
   showed significant differences in soil depths, while little difference

Abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is prone to drought due to the high variability in
   the Mediterranean climate with severe consequences for drinking water
   supply, agriculture, hydropower and ecosystem functioning. Because of
   the complexity and relevance of droughts in this region, it is necessary
   to increase our understanding of the temporal interactions of
   precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture that originate from
   drought within the Ebro basin, in northeastern Spain, as the study
   region. Remote sensing and land-surface models provide
   high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution data to
   characterize evapotranspiration and soil moisture anomalies in detail.
   The increasing availability of these datasets has the potential to
   overcome the lack of in situ observations of evapotranspiration and soil
   moisture. In this study, remote sensing data of evapotranspiration from
   MOD16A2 and soil moisture data from SMOS1km as well as SURFEX-ISBA
   land-surface model data are used to calculate the evapotranspiration
   deficit index (ETDI) and the soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) for the
   period 2010-2017. The study compares the remote sensing time series of
   the ETDI and SMDI with the ones estimated using the land-surface model
   SURFEX-ISBA, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI)
   computed at a weekly scale. The study focuses on the analysis of the
   time lags between the indices to identify the synchronicity and memory
   of the anomalies between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil
   moisture. Lag analysis results demonstrate the capabilities of the SPI,
   ETDI and SMDI drought indices computed at a weekly scale to give
   information about the mechanisms of drought propagation at distinct
   levels of the land-atmosphere system. Relevant feedback for both
   antecedent and subsequent conditions is identified, with a preeminent
   role of evapotranspiration in the link between rainfall and soil
   moisture. Both remote sensing and the land-surface model show capability
   to characterize drought events, with specific advantages and drawbacks
   of the remote sensing and land-surface model datasets. Results underline
   the value of analyzing drought with dedicated indices, preferably at a
   weekly scale, to better identify the quick self-intensifying and
   mitigating mechanisms governing drought, which are relevant for drought
   monitoring in semi-arid areas.},

Abstract = {Due to improper agricultural and soil management, there has been a drop
   in crop yield over the last few years and food security has become a
   major issue. For a country like India, with a huge population to cater,
   the problem becomes more serious. Since the inception of remote sensing
   in scientific agriculture management, optical remote sensing along with
   field data has been used for soil health monitoring and mapping. SAR or
   microwave remote sensing has an all-weather and high temporal data
   availability which has found applications for various domains. For soil
   health studies of multiple soil classes and sub-classes of same type,
   both aerial and spaceborne SAR remote sensing is currently in use for a
   multitude of monitoring and parameter modelling approaches. This study
   utilizes Sentinel 1 A, C-band SAR remote sensing data with VV and VH
   polarization channels for surface soil moisture estimation for alluvial
   soil and its sub-types in Rupnagar of Punjab state in India. While Index
   based OLS Regression method for soil moisture estimation was done using
   backscatter from Sentinel-1A SAR data, it was validated using Normalized
   Differential Moisture Index (NDMI) generated from Sentinel 2 optical
   datasets. This approach though did not consider the actual soil moisture
   data from field yet gave a low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.5 and
   R2-statistics of 0.72 (72\%) in training and testing phases. The Index
   based OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression method for soil moisture
   estimation aims to establish a technique for cases when field data is
   either not available or the study area is not easily accessible. In the
   statistical approach with field data, the same OLS model, when replaced
   by on-field surface soil moisture data gave a RMSE of 1.9 and
   R2-statistics of 0.968 and 0.948 in training and testing phases
   respectively at 97.5\% confidence level. The study is significant for
   using freely available optical and SAR remote sensing data parameters
   synergistically, in a simplified manner for surface soil moisture
   estimation. The results have comparable accuracies given by studies
   using commercial data and complex modelling approaches.},

Abstract = {The influence of soil water content on Aleppo pine growth variability is
   analyzed against climatic variables, using satellite and modeled soil
   moisture databases. The study was made with a dendrochronological series
   of 22 forest sites in Spain with different environmental conditions.
   From the results of the correlation analysis, at both daily and monthly
   scales, it was observed that soil moisture was the variable that
   correlated the most with tree growth and the one that better identified
   the critical periods for this growth. The maximum correlation
   coefficients obtained with the rest of the variables were less than half
   of that obtained for soil moisture. Multiple linear regression analysis
   with all combinations of variables indicated that soil moisture was the
   most important variable, showing the lowest p-values in all cases. While
   identifying the role of soil moisture, it was noted that there was
   appreciable variability between the sites, and that this variability is
   mainly modulated by water availability, rather than thermal conditions.
   These results can contribute to new insights into the ecohydrological
   dynamics of Aleppo pine and a methodological approach to the study of
   many other species.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the capability of remote sensing soil moisture (
   SM) datasets to estimate in- situ SM over the Lake Urmia Basin in Iran.
   A novel meta-estimating approach, called Voting Regression (VR), was
   used to combine the Gradient Boosting (GB) and Support Vector Regression
   (SVR) algorithms for developing a new hybrid predictive model named GB-
   SVR. Six SM products from the Global Land Data Assimilation System
   (GLDAS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil
   Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) were used to predict SM at 40 in-situ SM
   sampling locations. The performance of the proposed novel forecasting
   technique was evaluated using Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean
   Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results showed
   the superiority of GB- SVR compared to GB and SVR, with an average
   improvement of 17\%, 10\%, and 13\% in CC, RMSE, and MAE, respectively,
   in predicting in-situ SM. The model performance in different climates,
   soil textures, and land covers showed its better prediction accuracy in
   croplands (R-2 = 0.86), loam soil (R-2 = 0.74) and cold climate (R-2 =
   0.71), while the least in clay soil and barren lands. Besides, the
   in-situ SM prediction using remote sensing SM data performed better than
   that obtained using in-situ air and soil temperature. The proposed
   methodology can be used for accurate SM prediction in regions lacking
   in-situ SM data.},

Title = {Recent Progress on Modeling Land Emission and Retrieving Soil Moisture

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},

Abstract = {L-band passive microwave remote sensing (RS) is an important tool for
   monitoring global soil moisture (SM) and freeze/thaw state. In recent
   years, progress has been made in its in-depth application and
   development in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) which has a complex natural
   environment. This paper systematically reviews and summarizes the
   research progress and the main applications of L-band passive microwave
   RS observations and associated SM retrievals on the TP. The progress of
   observing and simulating L-band emission based on ground-,
   aircraft-based and spaceborne platforms, developing regional-scale SM
   observation networks, as well as validating satellite-based SM products
   and developing SM retrieval algorithms are reviewed. On this basis,
   current problems of L-band emission simulation and SM retrieval on the
   TP are outlined, such as the fact that current evaluations of SM
   products are limited to a short-term period, and evaluation and
   improvement of the forward land emission model and SM retrieval
   algorithm are limited to the site or grid scale. Accordingly, relevant
   suggestions and prospects for addressing the abovementioned existing
   problems are finally put forward. For future work, we suggest (i)
   sorting out the in situ observations and conducting long-term trend
   evaluation and analysis of current L-band SM products, (ii) extending
   current progress made at the site/grid scale to improve the L-band
   emission simulation and SM retrieval algorithms and products for both
   frozen and thawed ground at the plateau scale, and (iii) enhancing the
   application of L-band satellite-based SM products on the TP by
   implementing methods such as data assimilation to improve the
   understanding of plateau-scale water cycle and energy balance.},

   accurately predict three-dimensional soil moisture in an in-service
   uranium disposal cell},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {369},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {One reason arid and semi-arid environments have been used to store waste
   is due to low groundwater recharge, presumably limiting the potential
   for meteoric water to mobilize and transport contaminants into
   groundwater. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management
   (LM) is evaluating selected uranium mill tailings disposal cell covers
   to be managed as evapotranspiration (ET) covers, where vegetation is
   used to naturally remove water from the cover profile via transpiration,
   further reducing deep percolation. An important parameter in monitoring
   the performance of ET covers is soil moisture (SM). If SM is too high,
   water may drain into tailings material, potentially transporting
   contaminants into groundwater; if SM is too low, radon flux may increase
   through the cover. However, monitoring SM via traditional
   instrumentation is invasive, expensive, and may fail to account for
   spatial heterogeneity, especially over vegetated disposal cells. Here we
   investigated the potential for non-invasive SM monitoring using radar
   remote sensing and other geospatial data to see if this approach could
   provide a practical, accurate, and spatially comprehensive tool to
   monitor SM. We used theoretical simulations to analyze the sensitivity
   of multi-frequency radar backscatter to SM at different depths of a
   field-scale (3 ha) drainage lysimeter embedded within an in-service LM
   disposal cell. We then evaluated a shallow and deep form of machine
   learning (ML) using Google Earth Engine to integrate multi-source
   observations and estimate the SM profile across six soil layers from
   depths of 0-2 m. The ML models were trained using in situ SM
   measurements from 2019 and validated using data from 2014 to 2018 and
   2020-2021. Model predictors included backscatter observations from
   satellite synthetic aperture radar, vegetation, temperature products
   from optical infrared sensors, and accumulated, gridded rainfall data.
   The radar simulations confirmed that the lower frequencies (L- and
   P-band) and smaller incidence angles show better sensitivity to deeper
   soil layers and an overall larger SM dynamic range relative to the
   higher frequencies (C- and X-band). The ML models produced accurate SM
   estimates throughout the soil profile (r values from 0.75 to 0.94; RMSE
   = 0.003-0.017 cm3/cm3; bias = 0.00 cm3/cm3), with the simpler
   shallow-learning approach outperforming a selected deeplearning model.
   The ML models we developed provide an accurate, cost-effective tool for
   monitoring SM within ET covers that could be applied to other vegetated
   disposal cell covers, potentially including those with rock-armored
   covers.},

Title = {A pixel-wise calculation of soil evaporative efficiency with

   downscaling microwave soil moisture},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {276},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) was estimated as the relative
   difference of soil temperature (T-s) to its maximum (T-s(max)) and
   minimum (T-s(min)) values at `minimum and maximum' soil moisture (SM),
   i.e., SEE= (T-s(max)-T-s)/ (T-s(max)-T-s(min)). This thermal indicator
   of SM (SMI) has been proven effective in downscaling satellite microwave
   SM in some local areas. However, the T-s(max) and T-s(min) were usually
   determined in an empirical way which is not conducive to a wider range
   of applications or global downscaling. In addition to the Ts-based SMI
   (SEE), solo-LST (Land Surface Temperature)-based SMI and composite index
   of LST and optical SMIs have also been widely used in downscaling
   microwave SM. However, they have rarely been evaluated with spatially
   distributed SM at a similar spatial resolution, leading to a vague
   understanding of their pros and cons in the downscaling. In this study,
   we first implemented a pixel-wise and theoretically calculating of SEE
   with LST/FVC space and meteorological reanalysis data. Then, a critical
   evaluation with satellite, aircraft, and in-situ SM observations was
   made via the SMPAVEX15 and SMAPVEX16 aircraft-based field experiments.
   Results indicated that the thermal SMIs presented a better performance
   than the optical SMIs for depicting the variations of SM. Among the
   thermal SMIs, Ts-based SEE showed better performance than the
   solo-LST-based index and the composite index temperature-vegetation-soil
   moisture dryness index (TVMDI). The results demonstrate the validity and
   necessity of obtaining the Ts-based SEE for downscaling satellite
   microwave SM with thermal/optical data. The provided pixel-wise method
   was validated in this study for calculating the T-s-based SEE, which is
   suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave SM with
   microwave and thermal/optical fusion. However, the disadvantages of
   cloud contamination, the decoupling effect, and uncertainties brought by
   complex meteorological conditions and reanalysis data urgently need more
   research efforts.},

Abstract = {A theory of maximum entropy production (MEP) for electromagnetic wave
   propagation in dielectric materials is proposed and applied to
   simultaneously retrieving soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water
   content (VWC) from L-band microwave brightness temperature (TB). One
   representation of the MEP principle states that a non-equilibrium system
   corresponds to such a configuration of energy fluxes that minimizes a
   dissipation function under the constraint of energy conservation. The
   dissipation function for radiative transfer is formulated as an analogy
   of that for heat transfer. A new physical parameter, radiative inertia
   as an analogy of thermal inertia, is introduced to characterize
   radiative attenuation in dielectric media. The radiative inertia is
   parameterized in terms of the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves
   as a function of the complex dielectric constant. The MEP based
   retrieval algorithm predicts SM and VWC by minimizing the dissipation
   function under the constraint of the conservation of radiative energy.
   The retrievals of SM and VWC based on the MEP theory were validated
   against field observations in tropical and temperate forested regions of
   the Amazon and North America. The proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates
   the capability of the MEP algorithm for simultaneous retrievals of SM
   and VWC even for dense canopy (e.g., VWC > 5 kg m(-2)). The MEP method
   is a new theoretical framework for developing innovative remote sensing
   algorithms of the Earth system not limited to microwave observations.},

   The results of the uncertainty analysis showed that among the studied

   0.4, d-factor = 0.25 and, P-CI = 100 was considered as the most accurate
   model with the least uncertainty. Also, the results of GSA were
   demonstrated that alpha and n parameters were sensitive parameters in
   the models. Consequently, identifying the uncertainty of the SWRC model

   sub-humid mountainous catchment (6.48 km(2)) of Northern China. Rainfall
   was measured using nine bucket raingauges. Soil moisture probes were set

   41\%, which increased to 71\% during heavy rainfall events (>20 mm)
   revealing a strong influence of the amount and intensity of rainfall.
   The study also revealed that the PF increased with antecedent soil
   moisture. Soil moisture was much higher on flat sites compared to
   sloping sites, providing evidence that the topography has a strong
   influence on rainfall infiltration and runoff which, subsequently,
   influence soil moisture variation and the occurrence of PF. Our findings

Title = {Variations in soil nutrient dynamics and their composition in rice under

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {281},
Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Rice-crab co-culture (RC) is an environmentally friendly,
   agri-aquaculture technique, however, its knowledge about soil nutrients
   status and their composition in rice grain has remained unexplored. The
   aim of current study is to explore this deficiency. Thus, a field survey
   and a field experiment were combinedly carried out at Panjin City,
   China. The field survey with 16 fields each for rice-monoculture (RM)
   and RC was conducted without influencing conventional cultural
   practices. The field experiment was conducted with four treatments:
   rice-monoculture (RM), 3000 crabs ha(-1) without feed (RC3000), 6000
   crabs ha(-1) with feed (RC6000), and 12,000 crabs ha(-1) with 2 x feed
   (RC12000). Results showed an increase in soil nutrients and improved
   nutrient accumulation in rice with the RC system. Soil organic carbon,
   macronutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and
   magnesium (Mg)), microbial biomass carbon, and nitrogen, micronutrients
   (copper, zinc (Zn), and manganese) were improved. From the field survey,
   results indicated significant improvement in grain TN (9.4\%), calcium
   (Ca, 22.1\%), Mg (7.1\%), and Zn (26.1\%) in RC system compared to RM
   system. In field experiment, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Zn were
   increased as follows: i) Grain Ca in RC3000 (23.9\%) and RC6000
   (17.1\%), ii) Mg in RC3000 (12.6\%), RC6000 (16.3\%), and RC12000
   (11.8\%), iii) Zn in RC3000 (10.8\%), RC6000 (5.7\%), and in RC12000
   (14.8\%). The RC system has also improved nutrients translocation from
   soil to plant biomass that was the key reason to increase nutrient
   composition in rice. The results implied that the improvement of rice
   yield was by the increased nutrient in soil and the higher nutrient
   translocation capacity from soil to rice under the proper culturing crab

Title = {Soil nutrient deficiency assessment under soybean cropping systems using

Abstract = {Soybean is one of the promising crops in the Benin agro-industrial
   sector, but its production is carried out at the expense of the inherent
   soil fertility. The present study aims to apply the DRIS (Diagnosis and
   Recommendation Integrated System) for nutrient status assessment in
   farmers' soybean fields in northern and central Benin. Sixty-two plant
   leaf samples were collected during a survey carried out in 2019 in
   farmers' fields. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium
   (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the leaf samples
   were analysed. DRIS norms were used to calculate the various paired
   nutrient ratios in the high-yielding population. Nutrient balance
   indices (NBI) were also determined. Nutrient requirements based on NBI
   were ranked according Zn > N > P > Ca > K > Mg, highlighting the
   importance of Zn and N in soybean nutrition. Paired nutrient ratios
   (N/P, N/K, Mg/N, N/Ca, Ca/P, K/Ca, Mg/Ca, Zn/Mg) were either
   significantly (p = 0.0001) higher or lower than those in the literature,
   excluding Mg/P, Mg/K, P/Zn, Ca/Zn, N/Zn K/Zn and P/K paired ratios. This
   observation indicates the necessity of calibrating DRIS norms taking
   into account local conditions and cropping systems. The DRIS model could
   be an important tool for refining soybean nutrient needs in a cropping
   system. Zinc and N levels limited soybean cultivation in farmers' fields
   and must be included in the soybean fertiliser formulations to ensure
   optimal yield of soybean in Benin.},

Title = {Long-term Landsat monitoring of mining subsidence based on

   Province, China},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {102},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Ground subsidence caused by mining activities has extensively and
   chronically affected people living near mining areas. Remote sensing
   images provide temporally and spatially continuous observations of
   surface natural resources. In order to accurately understand and
   continuously observe subsidence areas, this study investigated the
   spatiotemporal dynamics of mining subsidence using long-term Landsat
   time-series. The study area was a typical mining region in Shanxi
   Province, China, with a long history of mining activity. Landsat images
   from 1986 to 2019, as well as reference data, were used to construct
   inter-annual time-series trajectories of soil moisture, which were
   derived from spatial normalizations of the soil moisture monitoring
   index(SSMMI). The LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine
   platform was then used to extract the subsidence areas and their
   spatiotemporal dynamics. The results indicate that (i)the map of the
   spatial distributions of mining subsidence had an overall accuracy of
   83.8\% and indicate that areas that underwent subsidence were mainly
   concentrated in mining cites(including Taiyuan, Lvliang, and Linfen);
   (ii)subsidence before 1990 accounted for 39.6\% of the total occurrences
   and a large proportion(45.18\%) of the subsidence was short-term;
   (iii)subsidence in mountain areas that have long histories of mining and
   long subsidence durations require further attention by researchers. This
   study allows us to advance the long-term monitoring of mining subsidence
   times using variations in soil moisture, combined with moderate
   resolution satellite data such as Landsat and time-series analysis
   algorithms.},

Title = {Estimating water balance components in irrigated agriculture using a
   combined approach of soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, and
   numerical modelling},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and
   groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to
   differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets,
   there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different
   methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we
   propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater
   recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that
   considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid
   environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of
   precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for
   sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil
   moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and
   numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine
   weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from
   satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices,
   which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and
   transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are
   derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates
   are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial
   estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate
   of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated
   into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the
   observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with
   calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and
   groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural
   test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan.
   The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2\% in volumetric water
   content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and
   297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated
   water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77\% originates from
   irrigation.},

Title = {Soil fertility and agro-physiological responses of maize<i> (Zea</i><i>
   mays)</i> irrigated by treated domestic wastewater by hybrid
   multi-soil-layering technology},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {351},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The depletion of water resources has gained global attention,
   particularly in arid climates, where there is growing interest in
   reusing treated wastewater for irrigation. This study focuses on the
   impact of irrigating treated wastewater using a hybrid
   multi-soil-layering (MSL) technology on soil physicochemical properties
   and the agrophysiological characteristics of maize (Zea mays) cultivated
   in Morocco, a region characterized by arid conditions. To achieve this
   research goals, three plots were cultivated with Zea mays and subjected
   to irrigation with water of varying qualities: raw wastewater (RWW),
   treated wastewater (TWW), and well water (WW). This experiment ran for
   five months, covering one crop season. The physicochemical and
   microbiological parameters in the soil and water were investigated, and
   the agro-physiological characteristics of the maize crops were assessed.
   The findings revealed significant differences in physicochemical and
   microbial parameters within both water and soil, as well as in the
   physiological responses of the maize crop, among the three water
   treatments. TWW's quality met the permissible limits for direct
   wastewater discharge, as prescribed by Moroccan norms, making it
   suitable for potential irrigation reuse. Moreover, the higher content of
   key elements (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) in WW indicated that TWW was more
   suitable for irrigation. Zea mays irrigated with RWW and TWW exhibited a
   higher accumulation of protein and sugar content compared to WW
   irrigation. Furthermore, the biomass parameters, including root, aerial,
   and grain dry weight, showed a positive effect on Zea mays irrigated
   with RWW and TWW compared to WW. Total chlorophyll content, on the other
   hand, was highest in plants irrigated with WW, followed by TWW. Plants
   irrigated with RWW produced the highest amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus,
   and potassium. Conversely, plants irrigated with WW had a higher content
   of Ca, Na, and Mg. TWW yielded medium concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg,
   and Na compared to RWW and WW, attributed to the nutrients provided by
   irrigation with TWW using the hybrid MSL technology. In conclusion,
   aside from their use as irrigation water, treated wastewater emerges as
   a valuable source of plant nutrients and soil fertilizers. They offer
   significant nutritive value, enhancing plant growth, reducing the need
   for additional fertilizer application, lowering mineral fertilization
   costs, and increasing the productivity of infertile soils. This
   highlights the potential of treated wastewater to improve agricultural
   sustainability in arid regions like Morocco.},

Title = {More Precise Monitoring of Soil Moisture Content in Agricultural Fields
   by Upscaling Conversion of Multispectral Image Data From Unmanned Aerial
   Vehicles},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {79892-79904},
Abstract = {The utilization of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing allows
   for fast and effective soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring. Scale
   conversion can obtain remote sensing images at multiple resolutions and
   offer the possibility of improving the estimation accuracy of SMC, which
   is crucial for precision agriculture. To explore the effect of upscaling
   conversion on SMC monitoring with UAV remote sensing, multispectral
   images and SMC data at different soil depths were acquired. The
   multispectral image with an original spatial resolution of 0.1 m was
   continuously upscaled to 6 m (with a step of 0.1 m and a total of 60
   levels). The correlation coefficient method was adopted to determine the
   optimal scale, and spectral indices at the original and optimal scales
   were calculated. SMC inversion models at different depths were
   constructed at the original and optimal scales by multiple linear
   regression (MLR) and back propagation neural networks (BP),
   respectively. The results showed that the correlation of UAV
   multispectral data with SMC displayed a change in first enhancement and
   then fluctuating weakness with the increase of the upscaled levels. The
   optimal scale of UAV multispectral remote sensing for monitoring SMC at
   all soil depths was about 2 m. The BP models were significantly better
   than the MLR models. For example, in the SMC estimation at 0-20 cm, the
   RMSE of the BP model was reduced from 0.0110 to 0.0087 (20.9\%). This
   study can provide theoretical and technical references for improving the
   accuracy of UAV multispectral remote sensing for SMC monitoring.},

Abstract = {With population growth, water will increase in the following decades
   tremendously. The optimization of water allocation for agriculture
   requires accurate soil moisture (SM) monitoring. Recent Global
   Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) studies take
   advantage of continuously emitted navigation signals by the Global
   Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations to retrieve
   spatiotemporal soil moisture changes for soil with high clay content. It
   presents the advantage of sensing a whole surface around a reference
   GNSS antenna. This article focuses on sandy SM monitoring in the driest
   condition observed in the study field of Dahra, (Senegal). The area
   consists of 95\% sand and in situ volumetric soil moisture (VSM) range
   from similar to 3\% to similar to 5\% durinf the dry to the rainy
   season. Unfortunately, the GNSS signals' waves penetrated deep into the
   soil during the dry period and strongly reduced the accuracy of GNSS
   reflectometry (GNSS-R) surface moisture measurements. However, we obtain
   VSM estimate at low/medium penetration depth. The correlation reaches
   0.9 with VSM error lower than 0.16\% for the 5-10-cm-depth probes and
   achieves excellent temporal monitoring to benefit from the antenna
   heights directly correlated to spatial resolution. The SM measurement
   models in our research are potentially valuable tools that contribute to
   the planning of sustainable agriculture, especially in countries often
   affected by drought.},

Title = {Study of soil nitrogen cycling processes based on the 15N isotope
   tracking technique in the black soil areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {375},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {In recent years, biochar has been widely used for soil improvement, but
   there has been some variation in its effectiveness; the mechanism of
   regulating nutrient cycling in soil is unclear due to different soil
   textures and physicochemical properties of biochar. Therefore, in this
   paper, the effects of different tillage patterns and biochar gradients
   on the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and soil nitrogen fixation capacity
   of soybean were monitored in a phased manner by field trials using 15N
   isotope tracer technology. The results of the study showed that (1)
   biochar increases the soil's nitrogen fixation capacity by improving the
   structural stability of the soil. Total nitrogen (TN) content of the
   soil increased by 42\% after deep ploughing (DP) application of 500
   kg/acre of biochar. (2) Biochar improved the nitrogen use efficiency of
   soybean plants and increased soybean yield. Compared to that of shallow
   tillage (SP), deep tillage application of 500 kg/acre of biochar
   increased the nitrogen use efficiency of soybean by 0.62-3.45\%. 15N
   isotope tracking technology showed that soybean plants with deep tillage
   application of 500 kg/acre of biochar had the highest 15N content at
   flowering stage; compared to no biochar application, the 15N content of
   root, stem and leaf fractions increased by 65.4-86.9\%. (3) Biochar
   increased soil CO2 emission fluxes, reduced soil CH4 emission fluxes and
   soil N2O emission fluxes, with better GHG emission reduction under DP
   treatment. The regulation model of deep ploughing application of
   500kg/acre of biochar provides a reference and guiding meaning for
   future soil fertility maintenance and farmland soil tillage in black
   soil areas.},

Abstract = {Overground rock is a prominent feature of rocky desertification
   landscape in karst farmland; however, people often pay attention to
   their adverse effects, leaving their positive effects on ecohydrological
   processes and plant growth as rarely studied and utilized. In this
   study, the effects of overground rock film mulching (ORFM) on soil water
   flow behavior, soil water content and temporal and spatial heterogeneity
   were investigated through a dye tracer test and soil moisture
   measurement. Moreover, the effects of this technology on the root
   characteristics of crops (maize and broad bean) were analyzed. The
   results showed that ORFM treatment significantly increased soil water
   content and its spatio-temporal heterogeneity by preventing preferential
   flow at the rock-soil interface. It suggested that this practice can
   provide a more favorable soil moisture environment for crop growth,
   which was confirmed by the differences in root characteristics of crops
   (maize and broad bean) under different treatments in this study. It was
   found that ORFM treatment reduced the root radial extent of crops but
   increased the root biomass and root bifurcation rate, which are widely
   considered to be key factors in improving the efficiency of fine root
   absorption. Therefore, we believe that ORFM has great potential to
   improve the effective use of soil water and agricultural water
   management in karst areas, which is essential for sustainable
   agricultural development in the region.},

Abstract = {Remote Sensing (RS) offers efficient tools for drought monitoring,
   especially in countries with a lack of reliable and consistent in-situ
   multi-temporal datasets. In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index
   (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought
   Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, TVMPDI is the
   first RSDI using four different drought indicators in its formulation.
   TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional RSDIs
   including VCI, TCI, VIII, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end,
   precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data have been used.
   Different time scales of meteorological Standardized Precipitation Index
   (SPI) index have also been used for the validation of the RSDIs. TVMPDI
   was highly correlated with the monthly precipitation and soil
   temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively. The
   correlation coeffi-cients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from
   0.07 to 0.28, identifying the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for
   subsequent analyses. Since the proposed TVMPDI could considerably
   outperform the other selected RSDIs, all spatiotemporal drought
   monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI over the past 21
   years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution
   Imag-ing Spectrometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
   (TRMM), and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) datasets containing
   15,206 images were used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing
   platform. According to the results, Iran expe-rienced the most severe
   drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI value lasting for almost two years.
   Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as
   the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity and trend in the
   31 provinces of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various levels
   of decrease over the 21 years were found for different provinces, while
   Isfahan and Gilan were the only provinces showing an ascending drought
   trend (with a 0.004\% and 0.002\% trendline slope respectively).
   Khuzestan also faced a worrying drought prevalence that occurred in
   several years. In summary, this study provides updated information about
   drought trends in Iran using an advanced and efficient RSDI implemented
   in the cloud computing GEE platform. These results are ben-eficial for
   decision-makers and officials responsible for environmental
   sustainability, agriculture and the effects of climate change. (c) 2021

Title = {Improving UAV hyperspectral monitoring accuracy of summer maize soil
   moisture content with an ensemble learning model fusing crop
   physiological spectral responses},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {160},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) acquisition is vital for crop stress
   diagnosis and precision irrigation. However, UAV remote sensing-based
   SMC monitoring usually suffers from low accuracy and spatio-temporal
   applicability. To address these issues, this study integrated crop
   physiological spectral response features into an ensemble learning
   model. A two-year field experiment (2022-2023) was conducted. First,
   fractional-order differentiation (FOD) and continuous wavelet transform
   (CWT) were used to enhance the responsiveness of summer maize canopy
   spectra to SMC and leaf physiological parameters (LPPs), including leaf
   area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf water content
   (LWC). Afterwards, variable importance in projection (VIP) was adopted
   to characterize the spectral response properties of each parameter.
   Finally, a stacked ensemble learning model (SELM) based on Bayesian
   optimization (BO) was used to construct a SMC monitoring model, and the
   feasibility of fusing LPP spectral response features for SMC monitoring
   was evaluated. The results indicated that: (1) Changes in SMC had
   significant effect on LCC and LAI of summer maize, which in T4 (with
   field water-holding capacity of 80 \%-95 \%) were 14.07\% and 34.41 \%
   higher than that in T1 (40 \%-50 \%), respectively. (2) Spectral
   transformation could significantly enhance the correlation between SMC
   and LPPs with canopy spectra (the average increase of R reached 0.23).
   (3) Consideration of the crop physiology spectral response could improve
   the SMC monitoring accuracy, the LCC-FOD-BO-SELM had excellent
   monitoring performance (R2= 0.78; RMSE = 0.019). The monitoring model
   fusing LPPs spectral response features had the highest accuracy (R2=
   0.81; RMSE = 0.016). (4) BO could significantly reduce the overfitting
   problem of the monitoring model, with the maximum difference between the
   R2 of the training and test set after BO being only 0.01), thus
   improving the model's generalizability. This new approach to SMC
   monitoring using UAV hyperspectral data provide scientific support for
   precision agriculture and irrigation.},

Abstract = {When choosing sites for monitoring of soil moisture for hydrological

   identify the optimal soil moisture monitoring (SMM) sites in the Dry

   nine SMM sites were obtained using the MIF method, considering the
   factors of rainfall, soil type, land use, catchment slope, elevation,
   and upslope accumulated area (UAA). The AHP method was used to select
   the optimal sites using the site-specific criteria. 30.3\% of the
   catchment area in the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape
   (AWRA-L) Grid\_DC2 can be considered acceptable as representative area
   with the MIF method. Four potential sites were evaluated for each AWRA-L
   grid using the relative weights of the site-specific criteria with the

Title = {Modification of Nutrient Requirements for a Four Crop-Based Cropping
   System to Increase System Productivity, Maintain Soil Fertility, and
   Achieve Sustainable Intensification},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {Sustainable and resilient cropping intensity is now a global focus to
   address the food demand and nutrition security of the growing
   population. For sustainable intensification, maintaining soil fertility
   is a key concern. The nutrient management for the recently developed
   four crop-based cropping system in Bangladesh has not yet been studied.
   Hence, field experiments were conducted on the nutrient management of
   the four crop-based cropping system {[}Aus (pre-monsoon rice), Aman
   (monsoon rice), lentil, and mungbean] in calcareous soil in Bangladesh
   during the years of 2016/17 and 2017/18 to determine the appropriate
   fertilizer management package to improve crop productivity and sustain
   soil fertility. The experiment had six treatments assigned in a
   randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments
   included T-1 = control (without synthetic fertilizer), T-2 = 50\%
   recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), T-3 = 75\% RDF, T-4 = 100\% RDF,
   T-5 = 125\% RDF, and T-6 = farmers' practice (FP). The results revealed
   that the 125\% RDF significantly contributed to higher yields of all
   four crops. The rice equivalent yield (REY) was the highest for the
   fertilizer management of 125\% RDF, which was 45.5\%, 9.4\%, and 12.2\%
   higher than the control (T-1), 100\% RDF (T-4), and FP, respectively.
   Considering the uptake of nutrients (N, P, K, S, Zn, and B) by the crops
   in the cropping system, the 125\% RDF was superior to the other
   treatments. The nutrient management practices had a positive influence
   on the apparent nutrient recovery (ANR) efficiency of the cropping
   system. The fertilizer management of 125\% RDF was also economically
   more profitable due to the increment in the cost-benefit ratio of
   26.8\%, 4.4\%, and 4.9\% over the control, 100\% RDF, and FP,
   respectively. The results indicate that the current fertilizer
   recommendations and FP for aus, aman, lentil, and mungbean are not
   adequate for the change from the three crop to the four crop-based
   pattern, and an increased dose of fertilizer is required to increase the
   yield of each individual crop as well as the total system's
   productivity. The fertilizer use efficiency is also higher for 125\% RDF
   than the 100\% RDF and FP indicating that to sustain the soil fertility
   in the four crop-based system, the current RDF and FP are not
   sufficient. This finding will help intensive cropping areas in
   preventing nutrient deficiencies that would lead to a reduction in the
   crop yield.},

Abstract = {Cotton-wheat rotation is one of the profitable cropping systems under
   arid climatic conditions in the agro-ecosystem of Punjab, Pakistan. The
   cropping system's productivity factor is decreasing and is considered
   primarily due to imbalanced and non-integrated use of nutrients without
   taking care of soil health measures. Exploring the role of integrated
   site- specific nutrient management plans, treatments containing 2
   fertilizer doses, and 3 management techniques on soil organic matter
   (SOM), soil P \& soil K were studied in the cotton-wheat system of
   Punjab Pakistan for six crop seasons on a permanent layout. Substantial
   increase of 54-70\% in SOM over the initial level of 5.0 g Kg(-1) in
   sandy loam soil was observed by adapting integrated nutrients management
   (INM) techniques. Similarly, significantly improved level of soil test
   phosphorus STP was observed at the end of the sixth crop season and INM
   techniques resulted in a 429\% to 453\% increase in STP. However,
   statistical analysis revealed a non-significant effect of doses, and a
   significant declining effect on soil K was observed with the applied
   technique of only mineral fertilizer application. Highly negative K
   balance suggests that the system will not be able to sustain the
   long-term supply of K. Ranking of indices from the best to the least
   favorable was recorded as P>SOM>K.},

Abstract = {This paper examines the long-term impacts of the joint prawn-rice gher
   farming system on agricultural and household incomes, soil fertility,
   and productivity of modern variety (MV) rice in southwestern Bangladesh,
   based on socioeconomic data of the gher farmers and soil fertility data
   of their gher plots. In 2005, 20 farmers operating on 30 plots were
   randomly selected from the Bilpabla village of Khulna from whom prawn
   and MV rice production data were collected using a questionnaire; soil
   samples were also collected and tested. In 2011 and 2017, the
   sustainability of the gher system over time was assessed through another
   survey of farmers following the same methodology. Results revealed that
   although the nominal income from gher farming increased by 59 percent in
   2011 and 23 percent in 2017, the real income and per capita household
   income remained unchanged over time. Agricultural income has contributed
   about 65 percent to household income, which for gher farmers was about
   200 percent higher than average rural incomes in Bangladesh. Rice
   productivity declined slightly from its 2005 level. However, the
   productivity of MV rice under prawn-rice gher farming is substantially
   higher than in the conventional MV rice farming system. The positive
   estimates of the Mean Soil Quality Index and Soil Degradation Index for
   land used for MV paddy production within the gher indicate an increase
   in soil nutrients. This suggests that the joint prawn-rice gher farming
   system is relatively sustainable, having improved soil fertility and
   stabilized real income. Policy implications toward promoting
   agricultural growth in the southwestern region of Bangladesh include
   research on developing varieties of MV rice suited to prawn-rice gher
   farming and the development of commercial feeds and markets for prawn to
   further raise productivity and incomes of gher farmers.},

Title = {Effects of lime and steel slag application on soil fertility and soybean
   yield under a no till-system},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {196},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Steel slags can be used in agriculture, as they are composed of CaO,
   MgO, SiO2, and compounds such as P2O5, FeO, and MnO. The solubility of
   slag may be higher than that of lime, which can make this residue an
   excellent source for soil acidity correction in no-till systems.
   However, there are few studies reporting their benefits when applied to
   the soil surface. This study evaluated slag amendment effects on soil
   chemical attributes and on the yield and nutrient uptake of soybean
   following surface application and/or incorporation of different types of
   slag, in comparison to lime, on a tropical, acidic soil under a no-till
   system. The trial was performed in Botucatu, SP, Brazil. Six
   soil-acidity corrective materials were incorporated or surface-applied,
   including steel slag, ladle slag, stainless-steel slag, wollastonite,
   dolomitic lime, and calcined dolomitic lime, plus a negative control.
   Each material dose was calculated to raise the base saturation to 70\%.
   Slags can be applied in a no-tillage system with efficiency similar to
   that of lime for the neutralization of soil acidity, for adequate
   nutrition and yield of the soybean crop. Slags and limes showed similar
   effects on increased pH, decreased Al3+ concentration, and increased
   base saturation up to the 0.40 and 0.20-m soil layers at 12 and 23
   months, respectively, after the application of treatments, regardless of
   surface or incorporated application. The by-product application has an
   additional advantage, depending on the type of slag, that is the
   provision of phosphorus and/or silicon.},

Abstract = {An on-farm bamboo intercropping study was conducted near Solan, Himachal
   Pradesh, India. It uses a split-plot design with two bamboo species
   (Dendrocalamus asper and Dendrocalamus hamiltonii) and an open field
   condition as main plots, under which ginger (Zingiber officinale) was
   grown at five nutrient levels supplied through chemical fertilizers and
   organic sources (subplots). In the intercropping with bamboo species,
   ginger yield increased by 10.5-15.6\% in comparison to the open field
   condition. Application of farmyard manure (FYM) based on N equivalent
   ratio showed the best (P <= .05) yield response of ginger (rhizome
   length, 7.65 cm; yield, 4,028 kg ha(-1)). Photoactive radiation was
   reduced by 60\% under the bamboo canopy. Simultaneously, higher soil
   moisture (\%) content was noticed for D. asper. Various soil
   physico-chemical properties (top 0-15 cm) were significantly higher in
   the FYM treatment under D. asper than under D. hamiltonii or sole ginger
   cropping. Maximum returns (3,595.67 US\$ ha(-1) yr(-1)) were realized
   when the ginger crop was raised under the canopy of D. asper and
   supplied with FYM on N equivalent ratio + plant growth-promoting

Title = {Ramifications of groundwater model in WRF/Noah-MP coupled system:
   Effects on soil-moisture and regional climate simulation},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {37},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable that contributes for flux partitioning
   into sensible and latent heat components. There is a pressing need to
   study the impacts of shallow groundwater table dynamics on antecedent
   soil moisture and corresponding feedbacks to atmosphere. In this study,
   we evaluate WRF-NoahMP simulated soil moisture using two experimental
   configurations: one with the default, free drainage approach (CTL) and
   with Miguez-Macho groundwater scheme (GW). Results are presented for the
   study conducted over Ganga River basin, India between the years 2008 and
   2014 for all the three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). It
   was observed that the GW model runs, improve soil moisture in topmost
   and bottom-most layers. We discovered that the simulations improved
   temporal negative bias of seasonal accumulation during monsoon by around
   91 mm. In addition, the average negative bias in latent heat flux
   improved by around 28 W/m(2). Compared to CTL, GW was found to
   contribute additional atmospheric moisture content ranging between 3\%
   and 5\%. Comparison with in-situ ground water showed that model
   overestimates the ground water table depth. This can be attributed to
   the ability of the model to only simulate natural occurring
   variabilities and lack of inclusion of anthropogenic factors such as
   ground water pumping in the model. The groundwater trend in Ganga is
   declining at alarming rate. In addition, if over exploitation of
   groundwater is not monitored properly, water and food scarcity is an
   imminent threat to the country's economy. To the best of authors
   knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to be implemented over
   Ganga basin, which evaluates the role of shallow ground water table on
   regional climate using coupled atmosphere-land surface-groundwater
   model. In summary, we highlight that the groundwater component along
   with WRF-NoahMP coupled model improves soil moisture and precipitation
   representation over the Ganga basin.},

Abstract = {Accurate and continuous monitoring of soil nitrogen is critical for
   determining its fate and providing early warning for swift soil nutrient
   management. However, the accuracy of existing electrochemical sensors is
   hurdled by the immobility of targeted ions, ion adsorption to soil
   particles, and sensor reading noise and drifting over time. In this
   study, polyacrylamide hydrogel with a thickness of 0.45 mu m was coated
   on the surface of solid-state ion-selective membrane (S-ISM) sensors to
   absorb water contained in soil and, consequently, enhance the accuracy
   (R-2 > 0.98) and stability (drifting < 0.3 mV/h) of these sensors
   monitoring ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) ions in soil. An ion
   transport model was built to simulate the long-term NH4+ dynamic process
   (R-2 > 0.7) by considering the soil adsorption process and soil
   complexity. Furthermore, a soil-based denoising data processing
   algorithm (SDDPA) was developed based on the unique features of soil
   sensors including the nonlinear mass transfer and ion diffusion on the
   heterogeneous sensor-hydrogel-soil interface. The 14 day tests using
   real- world soil demonstrated the effectiveness of S-DDPA to eliminate
   false signals and retrieve the actual soil nitrogen information for
   accurate (error: <2 mg/L) and continuous monitoring.},

Title = {Poultry Litter Biochar Increases Mycorrhizal Colonisation, Soil
   Fertility and Cucumber Yield in a Fertigation System on Sandy Soil},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {There is a continuing argument about the benefits of biochar on
   arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) symbiosis, crop growth, yield, and fertility
   of soil. There is also limited research on the effects of biochar on AM
   colonization, cucumber yield, and soil fertility improvement. Therefore,
   this investigation aimed to determine the impact of poultry litter
   biochar (PLB) on colonization of roots by indigenous AM fungi in
   agricultural soil and their contribution to cucumber yield, nutrition,
   and soil fertility improvement. A field trial was conducted to assess
   the effect of PLB combined with compound poultry manure (CPM) and
   nitrophos (NP) fertilizer to investigate the response of treatments on
   nutrient-deficient sandy soils. Plant growth responses to biochar showed
   better plant growth and yield of cucumber. Application of biochar with
   and without CPM and NP reduced the negative impact of nutrient
   deficiency stress on cucumber growth. AM fungal colonization, soil
   fertility, and cucumber yield were improved with the combined
   application of biochar, CPM, and NP fertilizer. Post-harvest, soil C, N,
   P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn increased with application of
   biochar applied with CPM and NP. Biochar application with CPM and NP
   also increased the percent root colonization of cucumber. Use of biochar
   with CPM and NP has the potential to improve plant growth, yield,
   nutrient uptake, and soil fertility. Further studies in various
   agro-ecological conditions would help utilize this technology in
   sustainable crop production.},

   coastal Southern California},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {There is a lack of information on the reliability of smart soil moisture
   sensor -based irrigation controllers for autonomous urban landscape
   irrigation management using recycled water where water conservation is
   required, which is the main objective of this study. A three-year
   turfgrass irrigation research trial (2019-2021) using tertiary -treated
   recycled water (mean EC = 1.18 dS/m, pH = 7.5) was conducted in Irvine,
   California, USA. A total of 12 irrigation treatments were designed,
   including six soil moisture -based thresholds (for triggering and
   terminating irrigation events) x two irrigation frequency treatments
   (restricted versus on -demand). Weekly NDVI and canopy temperature data
   were collected during the summer irrigation season to assess the impact
   of irrigation treatments on the overall health and quality of `Tifgreen
   328' hybrid bermudagrass. Soil salinity and sodium adsorption ratio
   (SAR) were measured before and after the summer irrigation seasons.
   Findings revealed statistically significant effects of irrigation levels
   and irrigation frequency restrictions on NDVI over the three years. The
   temperature difference (dT) between turfgrass and air (Tc - Ta) was
   significantly affected by irrigation levels throughout the three years,
   while irrigation frequency restrictions showed a significant effect in
   the years 2021 and 2022. On -demand irrigation resulted in a 10\%
   reduction in temperature difference values during the study period
   compared to restricted irrigation. Variations in soil salinity levels
   were observed during the experimental periods; however, both salinity
   and SAR increased as the study progressed. Results indicate that fully
   autonomous hybrid bermudagrass irrigation with recycled water, based on
   recommended soil moisture thresholds of 75\% of field capacity over an
   extended period in a semiarid climate, may lead to unacceptable
   turfgrass quality.},

Title = {Assessing a VisNIR penetrometer system for in-situ estimation of soil
   organic carbon under variable soil moisture conditions},
Journal = {BIOSYSTEMS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {224},
Pages = {197-212},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Soils are one of the main terrestrial carbon sinks and contain more
   carbon than the combined total in the atmosphere and terrestrial
   vegetation. A major challenge is quantifying how much carbon is stored
   in the soil and how much it has been sequestered due to changed
   management practices. In this study, a visible and near-infrared
   (VisNIR) penetrometer system was developed to measure in-situ soil
   VisNIR reflectance spectra to a depth of 90 cm into the soil profile. A
   spectral library of VisNIR soil spectra collected in airdry and ground
   states were used to calibrate Cubist regression models for estimating
   soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. The External Parameter
   Orthogonalisation (EPO) transformation was applied to the in-situ
   spectra to remove soil moisture and other in-situ effects from the
   spectra. This penetrometer system was used to estimate SOC contents at
   three sites on three different days under variable soil moisture states.
   The penetrometer EPO performed better compared to the EPO constructed
   from moist cores. After applying EPO transformation matrix, soil wetness
   did not have any influence on soil SOC content estimations. The SOC
   contents were estimated using the in-situ VisNIR system were validated
   against lab-measured SOC content with mean R2, RMSE, and bias of 0.88,
   0.32\%, and 0.15\%, respectively. It is concluded that the VisNIR
   penetrometer can potentially be used to measure SOC content rapidly and
   cost-effectively in-situ with a fine depth resolution.(c) 2022 IAgrE.

Title = {Soil moisture drives the shift from selection to complementarity effect
   in the rainfed maize/faba bean intercropping system},
Journal = {PLANT AND SOIL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 APR 24},
Abstract = {Background and AimsSelection effect (SE) and complementarity effect (CE)
   are often considered as two key indicators to mediate the positive
   diversity-productivity relationship in the maize-legume intercropping
   system, as intercropping generally enables crops to use the available
   resources more efficiently than monoculture. Yet, it is unclear whether
   soil moisture drives the SE and CE transformation, plant-plant
   interaction, and accordingly affect the productivity.MethodsA two-year
   field experiment was conducted to explore the impacts of soil water
   status (with and without plastic mulching) on interspecific interaction
   and productivity and its key mechanism in the maize-faba bean
   intercropping system.ResultsLow soil moisture reduced the net effect
   (NE) and land equivalent ratio (LER) with evident yield loss (NE < 0 and
   LER = 1.05), whereas the improved soil moisture reversed this trend and
   resulted in overyielding (NE > 0 and LER = 1.13). Regardless of soil
   moisture, faba bean was the dominant species and maize was the inferior
   one. Low soil moisture promoted the contribution of SE to productivity
   (P < 0.05). In contrast, high moisture turned to lower the competition
   intensity of faba bean against maize and accordingly promote the
   transformation of biodiversity effect from SE to CE. The main mechanism
   was that the water competition imposed by faba bean strips on maize ones
   decreased the NE through reducing photosynthetic rate and water use
   efficiency of maize.ConclusionThe adaptive transitions of interspecific
   relationship and the biodiversity effect were driven by soil water
   availability. This novel phenomenon should be emphasized in the crop
   diversity management of intercropping system in the rainfed region.},

Abstract = {Soil degradation and high environmental costs impede agricultural
   production in North China. A 6-year field experiment was conducted to
   determine the effects of tillage practice and nitrogen application rate
   on changes in soil fertility and wheat yield. Four tillage systems
   (rotary tillage without maize straw return through 6 years, RT; rotary
   tillage with maize straw return through 6 years, RS; deep tillage with
   maize straw return through 6 years, DS; and rotary tillage through 2
   years followed by deep tillage next year with maize straw applied for
   two cycles, RS/DS) and three N levels (HN, 300 kg N ha(-1), refers to
   traditional farming practice; MN, 0.75 x HN, 225 kg N ha(-1), to
   recommended N rate; and LN, 0.5 x HN, 150 kg N ha(-1), to reduced N
   rate) were tested. The soil organic carbon, labile organic carbon,
   inorganic N, available phosphorus, and available potassium under straw
   return treatments were significantly higher than RT in the 0-30 cm soil
   layer (p < 0.05). The microbial diversity, invertase, urease, and
   alkaline phosphatase activities also increased when maize straw was
   returned. Tillage practices could distribute maize straw in different
   depths of the soil and then affect soil nutrients, enzyme activity, and
   microbial diversity. The RS treatment presented the greatest effects in
   the 0-10 cm layer, while more significant impacts were observed in DS
   and RS/DS treatments at the 10-30 cm depths. The levels of soil
   nutrients and enzyme activity increased with an increased N rate.
   Compared to that under LN, wheat yields increased under HN and MN
   treatments, whereas there were no significant differences between HN and
   MN (p > 0.05). An increasing tendency of grain yield was observed in DS
   and RS/DS, while conversely so in RS. RS/DS had lower farm costs than DS
   during the study duration. Thus, RS/DS at 225 kg N ha(-1) is the best
   method for improving soil fertility and wheat yield.},

   increases. There is a threshold value of the soil saturation, below and
   above which the sensitivity of flood peak to the soil moisture
   differentiates substantially; (2) For model spin-up, streamflow needs
   longer time to reach the `practical' equilibrium (10\%) than the soil
   moisture and latent heat flux. The model uncertainty from spin-up can
   propagate through the hydrometeorological modelling chain and get
   amplified into the flood peak; (3) For ensemble flood modelling with a

Abstract = {Liming is often applied to alleviate soil acidification and increase
   crop yield on acidic soils, but its effect on soil phosphorus (P)
   availability is unclear, particularly in rice paddies. The objective of
   this study was to examine the effect of liming on rice production, yield
   and P uptake in a three-year field experiment in a double rice cropping
   system in subtropical China. We also conducted an incubation experiment
   to investigate the direct effect of liming on soil available P and
   phosphatase activities on paddy soils in the absence of plants. In the
   incubation experiment, liming reduced soil P availability (measured as
   Olsen-extractable P) by 14-17\% and inhibited the activity of soil acid
   phosphatase. Nonetheless, lime application increased grain yield,
   biomass, and P uptake in the field. Liming increased grain yield and P
   uptake more strongly for late rice (26 and 21\%, respectively) than for
   early rice (15 and 8\%, respectively). Liming reduced the concentration
   of soil available P in the field as well, reflecting the increase in
   rice P uptake and the direct negative effect of liming on soil P
   availability. Taken together, these results suggest that by stimulating
   rice growth, liming can overcome direct negative effects on soil P
   availability and increase plant P uptake in this acidic paddy soil where
   P is not the limiting factor.},

   with P addition (P0 and P +), water (rain-fed and plastic film mulching)
   and isolation (root barrier and root intermingling) treatments. The data
   indicated that total net effect was higher than 0 under all the
   conditions, displaying facilitative effects of biodiversity on
   agroecosystem productivity. The dynamics of total land equivalent ratio
   demonstrated that the intensity of plant-plant facilitation became
   greater under P-deficient condition. Maize was the facilitated species
   consistently, while grass pea changed from facilitated species under low
   soil P and moisture to facilitator under high soil P and moisture. The
   driving mechanism was associated with soil acidi-fication and microbial
   community promotion effect under P-deficient condition. Intercropped
   rhizosphere soil phosphatase activity was increased by 4.9-17.2\%, and
   Olsen-P availability was evidently enhanced relative to monoculture.
   Interestingly, drought stress significantly enhanced this trend.
   Critically, root isolation confirmed that plant-plant facilitation was
   briefly driven by interspecific rhizosphere interactions. Conclusively,
   this study confirmed the context-dependent facilitation shift in
   agroecosystem and provided a novel insight into the importance of
   rhizosphere interaction on soil P availability and utilization.},

Title = {A method for estimating spatially continuous soil moisture from the
   synergistic use of geostationary and polar-orbit satellite data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable in the surface energy balance and
   water cycle, and its spatiotemporal dynamics are of great significance
   to climate, agriculture and other fields. Optical remote sensing has
   been widely used to estimate SM with relatively fine spatial resolution.
   However, optical observations are easily contaminated by clouds, making
   it difficult to obtain spatially continuous SM over large regions. In
   the present study, a semimonthly SM dataset over the study area of the
   entire Inner Mongolia region with nearly full spatial coverage was
   derived from the synergistic use of China's Feng-Yun (FY) geostationary
   (FY-4A) and polar-orbit (FY-3D) observations, following a previously
   developed trapezoid feature space in a pixel-to-pixel manner. A
   preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the
   proposed method over two main dominant land cover types (grassland and
   cropland) in the study region, where the China Meteorological
   Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and the Soil
   Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM products were provided as references.
   The results indicated that the estimated SM was well correlated to the
   referenced SM datasets, with a significant correlation coefficient
   varying from 0.5 to 0.8. Furthermore, for the grassland (cropland),
   unbiased root mean square errors of approximately 0.062 (0.097)
   m(3)/m(3) and 0.055 (0.069) m(3)/m(3) can be found when comparing the
   estimated SM with the CLDAS and the SMAP product, respectively.},

Abstract = {A persistent challenge in the measurement of soil moisture from
   satellites stems from the inherently low spatial resolution using active
   or passive system. The lobe differencing correlation radiometer (LDCR)
   on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) is shown to provide a
   capability to measure soil moisture at high spatial resolution for a
   range of scientific and operational purposes. Flight tests of LDCR on a
   fixed wing sUAS were performed at the Canton, Oklahoma Soilscape site in
   September 2015, and Irrigation Research Foundation (IRF) in Yuma,
   Colorado, in June 2016. The LDCR design and performance are discussed,
   and the calibration using both preflight lab test data and in-flight
   data over a calm pond was performed to calibrate the radiometer. Radio
   frequency interference (RFI) from the sUAS platform was observed and
   mitigated. The LDCR sampling processes are detailed and an
   implementation of the tau - omega vegetation correction model along with
   a semiempirical surface roughness correction model incorporating a
   full-domain soil moisture mapping algorithm is presented. The algorithm
   uses a weakly nonlinear observation operator suitable for irregular sUAS
   flight trajectories that maps volumetric soil moisture (VSM) on a
   user-defined product grid from the sUAS sampling grid. Using LDCR
   radiometric and thermal measurements, along with Landsat-based
   vegetation water content (VWC) and soil texture information, soil
   moisture was mapped at decameter spatial resolution. The retrieved VSM
   data are favorably compared with in situ VSM measurements and irrigation
   records. A method for determining LDCR VSM estimation errors is
   developed to quantify the mapping algorithm accuracy and assess the
   impact of error sources.},

Title = {Mapping barrier island soil moisture using a radiative transfer model of
   hyperspectral imagery from an unmanned aerial system},
Journal = {SCIENTIFIC REPORTS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB 8},
Abstract = {The advent of remote sensing from unmanned aerial systems (UAS) has
   opened the door to more affordable and effective methods of imaging and
   mapping of surface geophysical properties with many important
   applications in areas such as coastal zone management, ecology,
   agriculture, and defense. We describe a study to validate and improve
   soil moisture content retrieval and mapping from hyperspectral imagery
   collected by a UAS system. Our approach uses a recently developed model
   known as the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance
   (MARMIT). MARMIT partitions contributions due to water and the sediment
   surface into equivalent but separate layers and describes these layers
   using an equivalent slab model formalism. The model water layer
   thickness along with the fraction of wet surface become parameters that
   must be optimized in a calibration step, with extinction due to water
   absorption being applied in the model based on equivalent water layer
   thickness, while transmission and reflection coefficients follow the
   Fresnel formalism. In this work, we evaluate the model in both field
   settings, using UAS hyperspectral imagery, and laboratory settings,
   using hyperspectral spectra obtained with a goniometer. Sediment samples
   obtained from four different field sites representing disparate
   environmental settings comprised the laboratory analysis while field
   validation used hyperspectral UAS imagery and coordinated ground truth
   obtained on a barrier island shore during field campaigns in 2018 and
   2019. Analysis of the most significant wavelengths for retrieval
   indicate a number of different wavelengths in the short-wave infra-red
   (SWIR) that provide accurate fits to measured soil moisture content in
   the laboratory with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE)< 0.145,
   while independent evaluation from sequestered test data from the
   hyperspectral UAS imagery obtained during the field campaign obtained an
   average NRMSE = 0.169 and median NRMSE = 0.152 in a bootstrap analysis.},

Abstract = {Cropland evapotranspiration (ET) is the major source of water
   consumption in agricultural systems. The precise management of
   agricultural ET helps optimize water resource usage in arid and semiarid
   regions and requires field-scale ET data support. Due to the combined
   limitations of satellite sensors and ET mechanisms, the current
   high-resolution ET models need further refinement to meet the demands of
   field-scale ET management. In this research, we proposed a new
   field-scale ET estimation method by developing an allocation factor to
   quantify field-level ET variations and allocate coarse ET to the field
   scale. By regarding the agricultural field as the object of the ET
   parcel, the allocation factor is calculated with combined
   high-resolution remote sensing indexes indicating the field-level ET
   variations under different crop growth and land-surface water
   conditions. The allocation ET results are validated at two ground
   observation stations and show improved accuracy compared with that of
   the original coarse data. This allocated ET model provides reasonable
   spatial results of field-level ET and is adequate for precise
   agricultural ET management. This allocation method provides new insight
   into calculating field-level ET from coarse ET datasets and meets the
   demands of wide application for controlling regional water consumption,
   supporting the ET management theory in addressing the impacts of water
   scarcity on social and economic developments.},

   P application of 11.7 kg ha(-1)signifying that all treatments were
   over-fertilized with respect to phosphorus. Total and available
   phosphorus increased in response to increase in PPB. Changes in soil
   phosphorus fractions with depth were compared to control plot and
   considerable increase in all the P fractions was noticed. P application
   rate in excess of zero PPB (11.7 kg P ha(-1)) would increase various

Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {60},
Abstract = {Remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) dataset with well accuracy and fine
   spatiotemporal resolution is very valuable in various fields.
   Downscaling is a promising way to obtain such an SM dataset. There are
   currently two basic methodologies in the downscaling with satellite
   datasets, i.e., the machine learning (ML) methods and the physical or
   semiphysical (PH) models. This study focuses on exploring feasible ways
   to integrate them for boosting the performance of downscaling. Here,
   three parallel modes, i.e., arithmetic average (Ari), geometric average
   (Geo), and weighted average (Wei), and two series modes, i.e., first PH
   then ML ( PH-ML) and first ML then PH (ML-PH), were developed and
   evaluated. A representative of PH, DSCALE\_mod16, and three ML
   algorithms, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and
   LightGBM, were used in this study. Microwave SM datasets from SM Active
   and Passive (SMAP) Mission, satellite datasets from Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and in situ SM observations spanning
   from April 2015 to December 2018 were employed in the evaluation.
   Spatial dynamic range, energy conservation, and precision preservation
   analyses were conducted as evaluation methods. Results demonstrated that
   the PH-ML series mode outperformed the other coupling modes, which was
   even better than the better one of the PH and ML. The PH can first
   generate a valuable initial estimate, and the initial estimate's
   advantages can be preserved, while its errors can be suppressed by the
   ML. Resultantly, the ideology of first using the PH to obtain an initial
   estimate and then putting the initial estimate into the ML is suggested
   for further microwave SM downscaling.},

   Method for soil moisture condition estimation by using SYNOP reports},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {119},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Estimation of soil moisture condition on a local or regional scale is
   one of the most important problems in vegetation conditions monitoring.
   One of the most suitable approach to do this over vegetated areas is the
   Land Surface Temperature - Vegetation Index (LST-VI) Triangle Method.
   This method estimates water content in soil which is available for
   plants in contrast to methods using satellite observations in the
   microwave band, and it is superior to pixel by pixel soil moisture
   methods using observations in the optical band which neglect statistical
   relationship between VI and LST controlling evapotranspiration on
   vegetated area. This study tested a methodological modification of the
   method based on assumption that evapotranspiration depends on the
   difference between the air temperature and the terrain surface
   temperature. The spatial distribution of Temperature-Vegetation Dryness
   Indices, which reflect soil moisture in the root zone was calculated for
   vast areas of Central Europe using the classic Triangle Method and its
   modified version. Both NDVI and EVI indices were used as input data in
   these calculations. The air temperature at 2 m height was taken from
   SYNOP reports, and the terrain surface temperature from MODIS data. In
   addition, Matlab scripts were written by the authors to allow convenient
   access to free SYNOP data. Our results indicate that proposed
   modification increases the accuracy of soil moisture estimation. This
   was confirmed by comparing classic and modified Temperature-Vegetation
   Dryness Indices values with rainfall data.},

Title = {Nutrient Use Efficiency as a Strong Indicator of Nutritional Security
   and Builders of Soil Nutrient Status through Integrated Nutrient
   Management Technology in a Rice-Wheat System in Northwestern India},

Abstract = {Nutrient use efficiency is reported as a strong indicator of the buildup
   soil nutrient status for nutritional security of crops through an
   integrated nutrient management approach under a rice-wheat system. The
   data revealed that integrated application of manures and fertilizers
   reported maximum organic carbon (0.39\%) in the treatment receiving
   100\% of the recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) + farmyard manure and
   lowering the pH to 6.39. The maximum available N (360.8 kg ha(-1)) was
   found in 100\% RDF + press mud treatment; available P (66.30 kg ha(-1))
   was found in 75\% RDF + poultry manure; and available K, Zn, Cu, and Fe
   (226.3 kg ha(-1) and 2.220, 0.732, and 36.87 mg kg(-1), respectively) in
   100\% RDF + farmyard manure treatments. Similarly, total macro- and
   micronutrient content in soil increased with the addition of organic
   manures alone or in combination with chemical fertilizers. The highest
   agronomic efficiency and utilization efficiency of nitrogen (41.83 and
   102.55 kg kg(-1), respectively) and phosphorous (83.57 and 204.9 kg
   kg(-1), respectively) were recorded in the treatment receiving 75\% RDF
   + poultry manure. This study concluded that the integrated application
   of manures and chemical fertilizers is a must for improving soil
   nutrient status and nutrient use efficiency and ultimately enhances
   nutritional security under a rice-wheat system.},

Title = {A Unified Data-Driven Method to Derive Hydrologic Dynamics From Global
   SMAP Surface Soil Moisture and GPM Precipitation Data},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Data sets provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the
   Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite missions contain rich
   information about land surface hydrologic processes.In this study, a
   unified regression method is proposed and applied to these global data
   sets to investigate surface soil moisture (SSM) dynamics. Two forms of
   regressors are implemented: 1) the linear regressors of SSM and
   precipitation flux and 2) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation
   flux with an additional interaction term. Regression results based on 3
   years of global SMAP and GPM data show that the unified regression
   method can identify the SSM characteristics found by several recent
   studies, including the SSM exponential decay rate, the fraction of
   precipitation retained in the surface soil layer, and the effective
   depth of hydrologic storage. Additionally, including the interaction
   regressor provides a novel way to derive the sensitivity of
   infiltration/runoff partitioning to antecedent SSM without the need for
   streamflow observations. These SMAP/GPM regression results are compared
   with those derived from a global SSM data set simulated by the variable
   infiltration capacity model. Relative to the satellite data, variable
   infiltration capacity retains moisture longer in the top layer, retains
   too much precipitation input in that layer, and exhibits levels of
   sensitivity of runoff/infiltration partitioning to top-layer soil
   moisture that generally match SMAP especially in humid regions. This
   study demonstrates that the regression-based method can recover useful
   process-level insight from SMAP SSM retrievals and is a viable tool for
   evaluating the representation of surface processes in hydrologic models.
   Plain Language Summary In the past few years, new satellite missions
   have been launched to make frequent observations of near-surface soil
   moisture and rainfall over most global land areas. In this study, we
   analyze these satellite observations to learn how near-surface soil
   moisture changes over time. Based on this analysis, we can determine for
   each location: 1) how fast near-surface soil moisture declines after
   rainfall, 2) how much rainfall enters the soil versus how much runs off,
   and 3) how rainfall partitioning is affected by near-surface soil
   moisture. The first two questions have been studied before, but our
   method is simpler and reaches the same conclusions. Our method is also
   able to answer the third question, which has not been looked at before.
   Finally, we analyze a model-based near-surface soil moisture data set in
   the same way and compare the results with our observation-based finding.
   In this way, we pinpoint aspects of the mathematical model that do not
   correctly mimic the real-world evolution of near-surface soil moisture.
   This insight will guide model upgrades that better capture reality.},

Title = {Soil moisture estimation with a remotely sensed dry edge determination
   based on the land surface temperature-vegetation index method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {13},
Number = {2},
Month = {MAY 8},
Abstract = {As a crucial parameter in land surface systems, soil moisture plays an
   important role in surface energy balance studies, environmental
   detection, and global climate change research. Remotely sensed data have
   been used for estimating soil moisture through different approaches,
   which has resulted in many achievements. Previous studies showed that
   the land surface temperature (LST) vegetation index method (LST-VI
   method) can obtain surface soil moisture with remote sensing sources,
   and it is relatively simple and easy to operate at a regional scale.
   However, one thorny difficulty is the dry edge determination from the
   LST-VI feature space. In this study, a remote sensing method is proposed
   to determine the theoretical dry edge from the LST-VI scatter plots,
   which do not require any ground measured auxiliary data. Based on the
   surface energy balance principle, this method derived the maximum LSTs
   for bare soil and full vegetation cover using MODIS products. The air
   temperature is parameterized by the LST using a semiempirical formula as
   the theoretical wet edge. The estimated soil moisture is validated by in
   situ measurements at a comprehensive weather station of Yucheng. The
   coefficient of determination is similar to 0.60, and the root mean
   square error is about 0.08 m(3)/m(3). The relevant key parameters in
   determining the dry edge are also validated from the meteorological
   observation. The air temperature and net surface shortwave radiation
   flux all reach a very high level, with an RMSE of 3.75 k and 49.3 W
   m(-2), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method
   can derive the accurate dry edge to estimate soil moisture from the
   remote sensing data, which will provide great help for future studies of
   soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques. (C) 2019

Title = {A New Method for Generating the SMOPS Blended Satellite Soil Moisture
   Data Product without Relying on a Model Climatology},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture operational product system (SMOPS) is developed by
   National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide the
   real-time blended soil moisture (SM) for numeric weather prediction and
   national water model applications. However, all individual satellite SM
   data ingested into the current operational SMOPS are scaled to global
   land data assimilation system (GLDAS) 0-10 cm SM climatology before the
   combination. As a result, the useful information from the original
   microwave SM retrievals could be lost, and the GLDAS model errors could
   be brought into the final SMOPS blended product. In this paper, we
   propose to scale the individual SM retrievals to the soil moisture
   active passive (SMAP) data through building regression models. The
   rescaled individual SM data and the SMAP observations then have similar
   climatology and dynamics, which allows producing the SMOPScdr
   (distinguishing with the current operational SMOPSopr) data using an
   equal-weight averaging approach. With respect to the in situ SM
   measurements, the developed SMOPScdr is more successful tracking the
   surface SM status than the individual satellite SM products with
   significantly decreased errors. The proposed method also preserves the
   climatology of the reference SMAP data for the period when SMAP is not
   available, allowing us to produce a long-term SMOPScdr data product.},

Title = {Interaction effects of environmental factors on soil nitrogen fractions
   based on a novel sequential extraction method},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {73},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) is controlled by several environmental factors.
   However, it is unclear how these factors and their interactions affect
   soil N fractions (SNFs) because of the lack of systematic N extraction
   methods. The Harbin-Dali belt, a transect more than 3,300 km long across
   China covering various climates, topographies, soil parent materials and
   vegetation types, was taken as the study area, and the interactive
   effects on SNFs in largely undisturbed woodlands and grasslands were
   explored using three SNFs: labile N, moderately stable N and stable N.
   The soil N fractions were obtained through a novel sequential extraction
   method that used distilled H2O, 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 M HCl, 6 M HCl, mixed
   acid (1 M HCl and 5 M HF; MA), concentrated HCl (cHCl) and concentrated
   H2SO4 as extractive agents to successively separate H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M
   HCl-, 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N fractions. The results showed that
   increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) directly decreased the
   concentrations of H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N, suggesting that warming
   may reduce available N. The interactions between MAT, parent material,
   aspect and aridity index also contributed to the three SNFs. Vegetation
   and its interactions with parent material primarily controlled 6 M HCl-,
   cHCl- and RES-N, and climate and topography had indirect effects during
   these processes. Particularly, more cHCl- and RES-N were accumulated in
   areas with warm humid climates and rich vegetation species than in other
   environments. Moreover, soil labile N (H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N) and
   cHCl-N exhibited potential as sensitive indicators for reflecting the
   changes in MAT and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, the various
   interactions between climate and other environmental factors controlled
   the changes in most SNFs. This novel sequential extraction method thus
   offers a reliable analytical approach to measuring SNFs. Highlights Soil
   nitrogen fractions (SNFs) were fractionated via a novel sequential
   extraction method. Increasing MAT decreased the H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M
   HCl-N concentrations. Interactions of climate, parent material and
   vegetation affected 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N. H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M
   HCl- and cHCl-N are sensitive SNFs that reflect environmental changes.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for the estimation of root-zone
   soil water content (SWC) at the scale of several hectares. In this
   paper, we present the data recorded by a dense CRNS network operated
   from 2019 to 2022 at an agricultural research site in Marquardt, Germany
   - the first multi-year CRNS cluster. Consisting, at its core, of eight
   permanently installed CRNS sensors, the cluster was supplemented by a
   wealth of complementary measurements: data from seven additional
   temporary CRNS sensors, partly co-located with the permanent ones; 27
   SWC profiles (mostly permanent); two groundwater observation wells;
   meteorological records; and Global Navigation Satellite System
   reflectometry (GNSS-R). Complementary to these continuous measurements,
   numerous campaign-based activities provided data by mobile CRNS roving,
   hyperspectral im-agery via UASs, intensive manual sampling of soil
   properties (SWC, bulk density, organic matter, texture, soil hydraulic
   properties), and observations of biomass and snow (cover, depth, and
   density). The unique temporal coverage of 3 years entails a broad
   spectrum of hydro-meteorological conditions, including exceptional
   drought periods and extreme rainfall but also episodes of snow coverage,
   as well as a dedicated irrigation experiment. Apart from serving to
   advance CRNS-related retrieval methods, this data set is expected to be
   useful for vari-ous disciplines, for example, soil and groundwater
   hydrology, agriculture, or remote sensing. Hence, we show exemplary
   features of the data set in order to highlight the potential for such
   subsequent studies. The data are available at

Abstract = {Empirically-derived relationships are mainly used to estimate
   evapotranspiration (ET) in water balance models. Due to a lack of
   effective factors and correct conceptual relationships, the resulting ET
   may be inaccurate. Therefore, a hydrological model was developed by
   combining water balance and bulk transfer theory, called
   semi-distributed coupled water balance and bulk transfer (SD-CWBT).
   According to it, a dynamic interrelationship between ET and soil
   moisture was correctly established to estimate ET via physical concepts.
   Global gridded ET retrievals, which provide the spatiotemporal
   distribution of ET at a global scale, including ECMWF Reanalysis v5-Land
   (ERA5-Land), TERRA, Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM), and
   Operational Simplified Surface Energy Balance (SSEBop), were employed to
   evaluate the model. The results indicated the SD-CWBT, with
   Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE), and Root
   Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of {[}0.6, 0.95], {[}0.68, 0.96], and
   {[}12.61, 0.99] for the streamflow and groundwater level simulation,
   respectively, had better performance compared to the alternatives.
   Furthermore, the estimated spatiotemporal distributions of ET agreed
   well with the climatic-vegetation conditions.},

Abstract = {Despite a detailed knowledge of the spatial-temporal dynamics of
   irrigation being necessary to optimize the agricultural production
   without exacerbating the pressure exercised on the water resource, such
   information is still often lacking worldwide. In this study, a
   double-scale analysis on the detectability of the irrigation occurrence
   over an area in central Italy through remote sensing soil moisture is
   proposed; the period of interest is a 3-year time span from 2017 to
   2019. The detectability of district- or sub-district-scale irrigation
   signals through remotely sensed soil moisture data is investigated at
   two different spatial resolutions: 1 km and plot scale. Three soil
   moisture products sampled at 1 km resolution are evaluated: a DISPATCH
   (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange)
   downscaled version of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and two
   Sentinel-1-derived products, namely the 1 km version delivered by
   Copernicus and a plot-scale-born version developed by THEIA and
   aggregated at 1 km. The THEIA Sentinel-1 product aggregated at 100 m is
   used in the plot-scale analysis. Over the study area, the irrigation
   extent is determined by the fragmentation of the agricultural fields and
   the complex topography, making the adoption of plot-scale data
   necessary. Satisfactory results are obtained by comparing maps of
   irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution produced through the k-means
   clustering algorithm with ground-truth data, since the method fails only
   once out of seven in properly reproducing the irrigated or non-irrigated
   conditions occurred over four pilot agricultural fields.},

Abstract = {Drought is a multifaceted natural hazard that has an impact on various
   aspects like; agricultural, hydrological, ecological and socio-economic
   systems. Drought has been a predominant concern for farmers in Gamo Zone
   over the last decades; hence, monitoring drought is important for soil
   conservation, water planning and management to mitigate impacts on
   agriculture in the Zone. The vegetation indices normal difference
   vegetation index and vegetation condition index are popular since they
   are based only on satellite images. The present study attempts to
   monitoring spatiotemporal distribution of agricultural droughts and its
   association with land surface temperature, precipitation and soil
   moisture from the period 2000-2020 using remote sensing application
   method in Gamo Zone. The vegetation condition index (VCI) and Normal
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) were used to evaluate spatial and
   temporal distribution of agricultural drought in Gamo Zone. The Pearson
   correlation method was used to identify Normal difference vegetation
   index association with land surface temperature, soil moisture and
   precipitation. The results discovered that severe drought to very severe
   drought was identified in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2015 with the
   area coverage 39.7\%, 28.8\%, 33.4\%, 24.5\%, 61.3\% and 23.0\%,
   respectively. Similarly, the findings show that slight to mild droughts
   have a great chance of occurrence in Gamo Zone. The data also
   demonstrate that normal difference vegetation index has a strong
   relationship with land surface temperature (R = - 0.95), precipitation
   (R = 0.65) and soil moisture (R = 0.85), indicating that normal
   difference vegetation index is more sensitive to land surface
   temperature than soil moisture and precipitation, although soil moisture
   has a positive relationship with precipitation (R = 0.60). Therefore,
   this study revealed that normal difference vegetation index and
   vegetation condition index indices are suitable for agricultural drought
   monitoring and they are strongly associated with precipitation, soil
   moisture and land surface temperature. This study shall be helpful for
   decision makers to take the necessary measures by considering the
   drought risk maps for early warning system and future drought management
   plans.},

Title = {Flood modeling through remote sensing datasets such as LPRM soil

Abstract = {North Africa is characterized by several ungauged basins, especially in
   Morrocco, where satellite products could be an alternative of the lack
   ground-based measurements. In this study, the Land Parameter Retrieval
   Model (LPRM) soil moisture and the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals
   for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM-IMERG) were used in flood
   modeling in Moroccan ungauged basins (Bourrous, Al Wiza, El Hallouf and
   Jamala). We started with comparing GPM-IMERG Early with ground
   measurements from five rain gauges. Next, the Soil Conservation Service
   - Curve Number (SCS-CN) was applied with ground precipitation
   measurements, LPRM and GPM-IMERG Early datasets to simulated flood
   events in a gauged basin, the Ghdat. Finally, this SCS-CN model was
   transposed with these satellite data sets validated to those ungauged
   basins in order to reproduce flood events. The results show that the
   GPM-IMERG Early is best with in situ measurements (correlation
   coefficient = 0.50; relative bias = 27.51\%; probability of detection =
   0.77; false alarm rate = 0.23), on a daily scale. The observed
   precipitation, LPRM and GPM-IMERG Early were performed well in
   validation to simulate floods in the Ghdat, where Nash-Sutcliffe
   criterion range from 0.43 and 0.98 using the SCS-CN model. For Bourrous,
   Al Wiza, El Hallouf and Jamala all flood events and hydrographs were
   reproduced by GPM-IMERG Early and LPRM products. Furthermore, LPRM
   products were validated against soil moisture measurements with a
   coefficient of determine R-2 between 0.72 and 0.84. The results of this
   work provided interesting insights for flood modeling using GPM-IMERG
   and LPRM satellite products in ungauged basins.},

Title = {Estimation of root zone soil moisture at point scale based on soil water
   measurements from cosmic-ray neutron sensing in a karst catchment},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {289},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is an emerging method for
   continuously monitoring soil water content (SWC) at an intermediate
   scale. However, when multiple hydrologic units are present within its
   footprint, the potential application of CRNS in water resources
   management is restricted. Here we propose a new strategy to predict
   point-scale SWC in root zone established on CRNS-based soil moisture and
   improved relative difference method. A total of 768 days of soil
   moisture data were collected by CRNS at the intermediate scale and EC-TM
   sensors at the point scale in a karst catchment. The original and
   improved mean relative difference methods predicted point-scale SWCs
   within and without the effective measuring depth, respectively. The mean
   effective measuring depth was 13.16 cm, ranging from 10.13 to 19.23 cm.
   Both land use type and soil structure played essential roles in
   regulating point scale SWC in the soil profile. Point-scale SWC in root
   zone can be predicted accurately (P < 0.001) based on SWC data derived
   from the CRNS system. The prediction accuracy of point scale SWC can be
   improved by increasing the averaging time of the soil moisture values.
   Our results demonstrated that the proposed strategy was reliable for
   CRNS to predict SWC beyond the effective measurement depth. This study
   provides a good perspective for effectively managing of water resources
   in areas with complex hydrological processes.},

Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},

Abstract = {Semi-empirical models and machine learning (ML) models have been widely
   used in remote sensing studies. In order to explore the feasible joint

   designed and evaluated to synthesize the respective advantages of the
   two models to complete high-resolution soil moisture retrieval. Cycle
   and series mode improved the generalization ability of the retrieval
   models in the case of less labeled data and enhanced its physical
   interpretability. The deep and parallel mode improved the accuracy of
   the retrieval models in a wider range of applications with an estimation
   accuracy of 0.754 and 0.071 m(3)center dot m(-3) in terms of coefficient
   of determination and unbiased root-mean-square error in site-based

Title = {Predicting Soil Organic Carbon and Soil Nitrogen Stocks in Topsoil of
   Forest Ecosystems in Northeastern China Using Remote Sensing Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Forest ecosystems play an important role in regional carbon and nitrogen
   cycling. Accurate and effective monitoring of their soil organic carbon
   (SOC) and soil total nitrogen (STN) stocks provides important
   information for soil quality assessment, sustainable forestry management
   and climate change policy making. In this study, a geographical weighted
   regression (GWR) model, a multiple stepwise regression (MLSR) model, and
   a boosted regression trees (BRT) model were compared to obtain the best
   prediction of SOC and STN stocks of the forest ecosystems in
   northeastern China. Five-hundred and thirteen topsoil (0-30 cm) samples
   (10.32 kg m(-2) (+/- 0.53) for SOC, 1.21 kg m(-2) (+/- 0.32) for STN),
   and 9 remotely-sensed environmental variables were collected and used
   for the model development and verification. By comparing with
   independent verification data, the best model (BRT) achieved R-2 = 0.56
   and root mean square error (RMSE) = 00.85 kg m(-2) for SOC stocks, R-2 =
   0.51 and RMSE = 0.22 kg m(-2) for STN stocks. Of all the remotely-sensed
   environment variables, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of the highest
   relative importance in predicting SOC and STN stocks. The spatial
   distribution of the predicted SOC and STN stocks gradually decreased
   from northeast to southwest. This study provides an attempt to rapidly
   predict SOC and STN stocks in the dense vegetation covered area. The
   results can help evaluate soil quality and facilitate land policy and
   regulation making by the government in the region.},

Title = {Epidemic of Wheat Stripe Rust Detected by Hyperspectral Remote Sensing
   and Its Potential Correlation with Soil Nitrogen during Latent Period},
Journal = {LIFE-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Climate change affects crops development, pathogens survival rates and
   pathogenicity, leading to more severe disease epidemics. There are few
   reports on early, simple, large-scale quantitative detection technology
   for wheat diseases against climate change. A new technique for detecting
   wheat stripe rust (WSR) during the latent period based on hyperspectral
   technology is proposed. Canopy hyperspectral data of WSR was obtained;
   meanwhile, duplex PCR was used to measure the content of Puccinia
   striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) in the same canopy section. The content
   of Pst corresponded to its spectrum as the classification label of the
   model, which is established by discriminant partial least squares (DPLS)
   and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In the spectral region of
   325-1075 nm, the model's average recognition accuracy was between 75\%
   and 80\%. In the sub-band of 325-1075 nm, the average recognition
   accuracy of the DPLS was 80\% within the 325-474 nm. The average
   recognition accuracy of the SVM was 83\% within the 475-624 nm.
   Correlation analysis showed that the disease index of WSR was positively
   correlated with soil nitrogen nutrition, indicating that the soil
   nitrogen nutrition would affect the severity of WSR during the latent
   period.},

Title = {An Investigation of the Accuracy of EC5 and 5TE Capacitance Sensors for
   Soil Moisture Monitoring in Urban Soils-Laboratory and Field Calibration},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Recently, emphasis has been placed on finding a reliable estimation of
   soil water content. In this study, two capacitance sensors EC5 and 5TE
   (METER Group) were utilized. These sensors provide many benefits
   relative to other sensors in that they are cost-effective and very
   economical regarding energy use, operate at a high measurement frequency
   of 70 MHz, and are dedicated to measuring at a small volume because of
   their small size. This makes them suitable for the context of use in
   this research, which consists of multiple sustainable drainage systems
   SuDS. Several studies have evaluated these two types of sensor but not
   for urban soils with specific characteristics. In addition, results from
   the literature are divergent and the published calibration data are
   limited. Therefore, an in-depth investigation of their accuracy is
   assessed in this paper. At first, the literature's existing procedures
   and methods were examined. The sensor-to-sensor variability, as well as
   repeatability, were tested in soil and solutions. Additionally, a field
   calibration method was conducted to estimate the effects of soil texture
   on sensors readings. Two laboratory calibration methods having different
   principles were also applied, compared to each other and to the field
   calibration as well. Results revealed weak sensor-to-sensor variability
   (coefficient of variation up to 15\% in soil) and also good
   repeatability (0.1\%), for both sensors. A soil-specific calibration
   equation has improved the estimation of the volumetric water content. In
   case of soil having high field bulk density, the undisturbed soil
   calibration method described and proposed in this paper gives promising
   results. The latter method yields a volumetric water content (VWC)
   prediction accuracy of 0.025 m(3)center dot m(-3) on a sandy loam soil.
   This paper presents a large knowledge of capacitance sensors measurement
   technique as well as their calibration procedures and methods.
   Limitations of existing procedures have been identified and key elements
   for selecting the appropriate one are suggested. Derived calibration
   equations have also been provided for three urban soils with different
   particle size distribution, ranging from sandy loam to silt loam.
   Accurate monitoring of soil moisture content in urban soils is thus
   achievable.},

Abstract = {Improving nutrient use efficiency and system productivity with a
   positive nutrient balance in rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) is vital
   for long-term food security. Two-year field trials were conducted with
   the objective of computing the effect of different rates, time, method,
   and source of potassium (K) fertilization on nutrient recovery
   efficiency, nutrient balance, and system productivity in a dry
   direct-seeded RWCS with eight treatments. The two-split (half basal and
   half at panicle initiation) application of 60 kg K2O/ha resulted in
   37.5\% and 19.2\% increase in recovery efficiency of K in rice and
   wheat, respectively over basal application of 60 kg K2O/ha. Besides, the
   split-application of K increased the nitrogen recovery efficiency in
   rice and wheat by 11.2\% and 10.8\%, respectively. Similarly, the
   phosphorus recovery efficiency was increased by 3.6\% and 7.4\% in rice
   and wheat, respectively. The split application of 60 kg K2O/ha also
   increased the K harvest index (\% of the total K absorbed is transferred
   to grain) by 0.7\% and 2.7\% in rice and wheat, respectively over
   applying entire K at basal. Similarly, the system productivity (11.26
   t/ha) was increased by 8\% over applying entire K at basal. In the
   absence of top-dressing of K (30 kg/ha), two foliar-sprays of 2.5\% K
   provide equal benefits of top dressing. Application of 90 kg K2O/ha
   lowered the K negative balance (-99 kg/ha/year) considerably compared to
   two-split application of 60 kg K2O/ha (-152.5 kg/ha/year). Thus,
   optimization of K fertilization in RWCS will increase the system
   productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and sustainability.},

Title = {Development of Integrated Crop Drought Index by Combining Rainfall, Land
   Surface Temperature, Evapotranspiration, Soil Moisture, and Vegetation
   Index for Agricultural Drought Monitoring},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Various drought indices have been used for agricultural drought
   monitoring, such as Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Standardized
   Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), Palmer Drought Severity
   Index (PDSI), Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI), Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Health Index (VHI), Vegetation
   Drought Response Index (VegDRI), and Scaled Drought Condition Index
   (SDCI). They incorporate such factors as rainfall, land surface
   temperature (LST), potential evapotranspiration (PET), soil moisture
   content (SM), and vegetation index to express the meteorological and
   agricultural aspects of drought. However, these five factors should be
   combined more comprehensively and reasonably to explain better the
   dryness/wetness of land surface and the association with crop yield.
   This study aims to develop the Integrated Crop Drought Index (ICDI) by
   combining the weather factors (rainfall and LST), hydrological factors
   (PET and SM), and a vegetation factor (enhanced vegetation index (EVI))
   to better express the wet/dry state of land surface and
   healthy/unhealthy state of vegetation together. The study area was the
   State of Illinois, a key region of the U.S. Corn Belt, and the
   quantification and analysis of the droughts were conducted on a county
   scale for 2004-2019. The performance of the ICDI was evaluated through
   the comparisons with SDCI and VegDRI, which are the representative
   drought index in terms of the composite of the dryness and vegetation
   elements. The ICDI properly expressed both the dry and wet trend of the
   land surface and described the state of the agricultural drought
   accompanied by yield damage. The ICDI had higher positive correlations
   with the corn yields than SDCI and VegDRI during the crucial growth
   period from June to August for 2004-2019, which means that the ICDI
   could reflect the agricultural drought well in terms of the
   dryness/wetness of land surface and the association with crop yield.
   Future work should examine the other factors for ICDI, such as locality,
   crop type, and the anthropogenic impacts, on drought. It is expected

Title = {Monitoring Residual Soil Moisture and Its Association to the Long-Term
   Variability of Rainfall over the Upper Blue Nile Basin in Ethiopia},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture and its association with rainfall variability
   is important to comprehend the hydrological processes and to set proper
   agricultural water use management to maximize crop growth and
   productivity. In this study, the European Space Agency's Climate Change
   Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture product was applied to assess the
   dynamics of residual soil moisture in autumn (September to November) and
   its response to the long-term variability of rainfall in the Upper Blue
   Nile Basin (UBNB) of Ethiopia from 1992 to 2017. The basin was found to
   have autumn soil moisture (ASM) ranging from 0.09-0.38 m(3)/m(3), with
   an average of 0.26 m(3)/m(3). The ASM time series resulted in the
   coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 2.8\%-28\% and classified as
   low-to-medium variability. In general, the monotonic trend analysis for
   ASM revealed that the UBNB had experienced a wetting trend for the past
   26 years (1992-2017) at a rate of 0.00024 m(3)/m(3)per year. A
   significant wetting trend ranging from 0.001 to 0.006 m(3)/m(3)per year
   for the autumn season was found. This trend was mainly showed across the
   northwest region of the basin and covers about 18\% of the total basin
   area. The spatial patterns and variability of rainfall and ASM were also
   found to be similar, which implies the strong relationship between
   rainfall and soil moisture in autumn. The spring and autumn season
   rainfall explained a considerable portion of ASM in the basin. The
   analyses also signified that the rainfall amount and distribution
   impacted by the topography and land cover classes of the basin showed a
   significant influence on the characteristics of the ASM. Further, the
   result verified that the behavior of ASM could be controlled by the loss
   of soil moisture through evapotranspiration and the gain from rainfall,
   although changes in rainfall were found to be the primary driver of ASM
   variability over the UBNB.},

Title = {Sensor records can be used to forecast complex soil moisture dynamics
   with symbiosis of empirical nonlinear dynamics and echo state neural
   network AI},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {222},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {We reconstructed soil moisture dynamics from sensor records, taught
   reconstructed dynamics to echo state neural networks (ESNN), and
   employed skillful ESNN architectures as digital twins to forecast
   real-world soil moisture levels out-of-sample. Recent proof-of-concept
   demonstrates that ESNN can learn complex nonlinear dynamics from clean
   data generated by closed `toy' models with known state-space dynamics.
   However, in modeling open real-world biophysical systems like the soil,
   we do not directly observe state space dynamics, and consequently must
   infer them from noisy data. We addressed these challenges by
   preprocessing data inputted into ESNN with methods from empirical
   nonlinear dynamics to filter noise, test for stationarity, and
   reconstruct state-space dynamics from denoised data. This promotes the
   dynamic efficiency of ESNN since it learns complex dynamics of
   stationary real-world dynamic systems from denoised data. We worked with
   two sensor records representing different irrigation practices collected
   in field trials in southern Florida. We reconstructed lowdimensional
   nonlinear-deterministic dynamics in both records providing empirical
   evidence that irregular sawtooth cycling due to complex wetting/drying
   events is not aberrational but intrinsic to the real-world soil moisture
   systems generating these records. We employed the UF-NVIDIA-GPU
   infrastructure to uniformly sample a large grid of ESNN
   hyper-parameters, and successfully screened for architectures skillfully
   reproducing state space dynamics reconstructed from sensor records.
   Skillful architectures served as digital twins to forecast soil moisture
   levels preserving lower- and higher frequency oscillations
   characterizing both sensor records, and to differentiate between
   recurring and sporadic extreme soil moisture events. This distinction
   fine-tunes irrigation planning by forecasting recurrent extreme events
   to the day. Operationalizing ESNN for real biophysical data has broader
   impacts in addressing pressing environmental challenges involving
   nonlinear biophysical processes and creating AI-based early-warning
   systems forecasting extreme environmental events (flooding, drought,
   landslides, fires).},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture at the Earth'surface is of great importance for
   drought early warnings. Spaceborne remote sensing is a keystone in
   monitoring at continental scale, as satellites can make observations of
   locations which are scarcely monitored by ground-based techniques. In
   recent years, several soil moisture products for continental scale
   monitoring became available from the main space agencies around the
   world. Making use of sensors aboard polar satellites sampling in the
   microwave spectrum, soil moisture can be measured and mapped globally
   every few days at a spatial resolution as fine as 25 km. However,
   complementarity of satellite observations is a crucial issue to improve
   the quality of the estimations provided. In this context, measurements
   within the visible and infrared from geostationary satellites provide
   information on the surface from a totally different perspective. In this
   study, we design a new retrieval algorithm for daily soil moisture
   monitoring based only on the land surface temperature observations
   derived from the METEOSAT second generation geostationary satellites.
   Soil moisture has been retrieved from the retrieval algorithm for an
   eight years period over Europe and Africa at the SEVIRI sensor spatial
   resolution (3 km at the sub-satellite point). The results, only
   available for clear sky and partly cloudy conditions, are for the first
   time extensively evaluated against in-situ observations provided by the
   International Soil Moisture Network and FLUXNET at sites across Europe
   and Africa. The soil moisture retrievals have approximately the same
   accuracy as the soil moisture products derived from microwave sensors,
   with the most accurate estimations for semi-arid regions of Europe and
   Africa, and a progressive degradation of the accuracy towards northern
   latitudes of Europe. Although some possible improvements can be expected
   by a better use of other products derived from SEVIRI, the new approach
   developped and assessed here is a valuable alternative to microwave
   sensors to monitor daily soil moisture at the resolution of few
   kilometers over entire continents and could reveal a good
   complementarity to an improved monitoring system, as the algorithm can
   produce surface soil moisture with less than 1 day delay over clear sky
   and non-steady cloudy conditions (over 10\% of the time).},

   soil-crop system management on the Loess Plateau},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {351},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Ridge-furrow with full film mulching has been widely applied to increase
   crop yield and water productivity on the Loess Plateau, but it may
   stimulate carbon (C) mineralization. How to integrate other
   technological benefits based on this technology for long-term
   maintenance of high yield and soil fertility is a pressing issue. With
   the local farmers' practice (FP) as a control, three integrated
   soil-crop system management (ISSM) practices integrating fertilizer
   rates, fertilizer types and planting densities (ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and
   ISSM-MN) were established to improve maize yield and soil quality.
   Compared with the FP, the maize yield increased by 13.34\%, 21.83\% and
   30.24\%, and the soil quality index (SQI) increased by 9.66\%, 14.91\%
   and 38.38\% for ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and ISSM-MN, respectively. However,
   ISSM-N1 did not significantly increase yield, and ISSM-N2 increased
   residual soil nitrate and decreased nitrogen (N) partial factor
   productivity significantly. Compared to the FP, ISSM practices increased
   soil organic carbon (SOC), labile organic C fractions (LOCFs) and
   potassium permanganate organic C fractions in the topsoil to varying
   degrees, but only ISSM-MN reached significant levels for most C
   fractions. The sensitivity index indicated very easily oxidizable C
   (24.6\%), easily oxidizable C (24.7\%), hot-water extractable C
   (30.8\%), labile organic C (24.7\%) and particulate organic C (57.3\%)
   were more sensitive than SOC (22.7\%). ISSM-MN sequestered significantly
   higher C than the other treatments. The results of the relative
   importance analysis and the structural equation model indicated that
   LOCFs were the direct contributors to yield, while recalcitrant C (CO)
   was the indirect contributor, revealing the underlying mechanism that CO
   decomposed to replenish LOCFs and the total N pool with the water
   soluble C pool as the transit station. Overall, ISSM-MN is the most
   promising strategy to improve crop yield and soil fertility in the long
   term on the Loess Plateau.},

Title = {High depth resolution design of small diameter nuclear magnetic

   measurement in situ},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {603},

Abstract = {The soil moisture in the surface layer (1 or 2 m) interacts with the
   atmosphere through evapotranspiration and influences land-atmosphere
   interactions, impacts rainfall-runoff processes, regulates net ecosystem
   exchange, and constrains food security. Thus, the accurate measurement
   with high depth resolution of surface soil moisture is of great
   significance to hydrology, meteorology, and agriculture. The nuclear
   magnetic resonance (NMR) logging technology has the ability to study
   hydrogen-containing fluid dynamics in porous media and is expected to
   achieve in situ detection for soil moisture. In this paper, we propose a
   new design of a small diameter NMR logging probe based on compensating
   magnets, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and have high
   depth resolution (1 cm). The uniform design method is adopted to obtain
   the optimal compensation magnet parameters. Compared with the probe
   without compensation magnets, the SNR of the new probe can be increased
   by 5.2 times in theory. Then a soil moisture experiment of three group
   samples is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new probe.
   The experiment results show that the new probe can obtain accurate
   results of soil moisture, and can also give the proportion of free water
   and bound water, which has been verified with the results of the Lab-NMR
   experiments. Finally, the factors that have an important influence on
   the measurement effect, such as the uniformity of the excitation
   magnetic field, the radial depth of investigation, and the echo time
   have been fully discussed.},

   cropping system management and soil fertility},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {311},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Cover crops (CC) increase soil fertility via recycling of nutrients such
   as nitrogen (N) and buildup of soil organic matter, whereby CC
   contributes to climate change mitigation. The carbon (C) input to soil
   occurs via the input of plant material (shoot and root) and via phyllo-
   and rhizodeposition. However, the quantity of phyllo- and
   rhizodeposition from CC is largely unexamined, although this component
   potentially has a large contribution to microbial stabilization of C.
   Isotopic labeling with C-13 to trace C flows and N-15 to determine
   N-2-fixation was conducted to test the short-term effect of the
   inclusion of winter vetch as a legume species to a CC mixture. The CC
   mixtures were established in a long-term experiment (1997-2019) with
   varying use of manure and CC cropping to test the effect of soil
   fertility on the behavior of the newly established CC mixtures. A
   significant reduction in the relative net phyllo- and rhizodeposition
   was observed with higher soil fertility. Interestingly, the quantity of
   net phyllo- and rhizodeposition was also reduced with higher soil
   fertility due to the lower relative phyllo- and rhizodeposition, despite
   a significantly higher CC biomass. Importantly, adjusting for
   unrecovered root fragments more than halved the calculated phyllo- and
   rhizodeposition, indicating that many published estimates are
   substantially overestimated. The use of CC during autumn provides an
   important window for C storage with both the input of plant biomass and
   belowground C investment being drivers of C storage.},

Title = {Effects of Applying Different Organic Materials on Grain Yield and Soil
   Fertility in a Double-Season Rice Cropping System},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Double-cropping rice cultivation reduces soil fertility, and the
   extensive use of chemical fertilizers has harmful effects on both the
   environment and grain yield. The application of organic materials could
   be used as a practical strategy to maintain soil fertility and improve
   grain yield in a double-season rice cropping system. For this purpose,
   field experiments with six growing seasons over three years, from 2016
   to 2018, were conducted to assess the effects of five organic materials
   (biochar, Chinese milk vetch, rice straw, rapeseed cake fertilizer, and
   manure) on the grain yield and soil fertility, aiming to save about 25\%
   of the chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer required for all rice growing
   stages. The result showed that, compared with CK (the most common dose
   of fertilizer in this study region; 100\% chemical fertilizer without
   organic fertilizer), the grain yield and soil fertility of
   double-cropped rice were increased after applying organic fertilizers
   for three consecutive years. Specifically, the CRC treatment (Chinese
   milk vetch (10.77 t ha(-1) in fresh)/rice straw (26.51 t ha(-1) in
   fresh) + 75\% chemical fertilizer) showed significantly higher rates of
   effective panicles (4.65-10.92\%) and annual grain yield (8.00-8.82\%).
   The total N, total phosphorus (P), total potassium (K), alkaline N, and
   available P content in the CRC soil were significantly increased by
   11.85\%, 12.22\%, 15.08\%, 23.32\%, and 41.04\%, respectively, relative
   to CK. The decomposition of the applied Chinese milk vetch and rice
   straw combined with 75\% chemical fertilizer resulted in more soil humus
   (9.50 g kg(-1)), humic acid (3.19 g kg(-1)), fulvic acid (3.26 g
   kg(-1)), and active organic carbon (5.78 g kg(-1)) and a significantly
   higher carbon pool management index (13.5\%), as well as significantly
   higher soil urease activity (18.10\%) and acid phosphatase activity
   (17.64\%). Therefore, in this study, Chinese milk vetch (10.77 t ha(-1)
   in fresh) in the early rice season/rice straw (26.51 t ha(-1) fresh) in
   the late rice season + 75\% chemical fertilizer treatment was the
   optimal dose for the double-season rice cropping system. It resulted in
   higher rice yields and has the potential to be used for more sustainable
   soil fertility.},

Abstract = {Sustainable intensification of African farming systems has been high on
   the agenda of research and development programs for decades. System
   innovations such as integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) and
   conservation agriculture have been proposed to tackle the complex
   challenges farmers face. In this study, we assess how different factors
   at the plot, farm and institutional level can influence the adoption of
   ISFM. We employed a stratified sampling approach to randomly select 285
   and 300 farmers in Tamale, northern Ghana and Kakamega County, western
   Kenya, respectively. These two locations were selected to understand the
   underlying reasons for their divergent adoption levels. Ordinal
   regression models were used to identify determinants of adoption. In
   Tamale, adoption rates of ISFM are much lower than in Kakamega. Only 3\%
   of the farmers fully adopted the recommended practices compared with
   36\% in Kakamega. The low availability of improved seeds is a major
   reason for the lower uptake of the complete ISFM paradigm in Tamale. The
   econometric analysis revealed that plot level variables such as soil
   carbon, soil texture, slope and plot area had a significant effect on
   the number of adopted ISFM components at both locations. Moreover,
   family labor availability is also an important factor. Other farm and
   household characteristics, such as off-farm occupation, livestock
   ownership, and membership in associations, matter for Kakamega only. Key
   policy recommendations include promotion of locally available organic
   resources and improved access to improved seeds in Tamale.},

Abstract = {Regional-scale precise soil moisture measurements are required for
   remote sensing-based soil moisture product validation besides,
   complimenting in several hydrological and agricultural applications.
   Though the gravimetric method provides the most accurate soil moisture
   measurements, it cannot be extended to the regional-scale due to the
   large number of sampling requirements. An impedance probe is a suitable
   substitute for the time-intensive gravimetric method; however, it needs
   soil/field-specific calibrations for precise measurements. The present
   study aims to develop a generalized calibration of an impedance probe
   (i.e., ThetaProbe) for precise measurements of soil moisture at the
   regional-scale within the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.04 m(3)
   m(-3) to fulfil the accuracy requirement of current satellite missions.
   A few methods for calibrating impedance probe were investigated using
   496 gravimetric samples and coincident impedance probe measurements
   collected over 83 locations through field campaigns in a paddy dominated
   tropical Indian watershed that covers an area of 500 km(2). The
   manufacturer generalized calibration was found to have high RMSE (0.0523
   m(3) m(-3)) and considerable bias (0.0241 m(3) m(-3)) in soil moisture
   measurements. Developed generalized and soil-specific calibration based
   on a linear regression technique that resulted in RMSE values of 0.0468
   and 0.0422 m(3) m(-3), respectively. Further, a Bayesian neural network
   (BNN) based method, a nonlinear technique, was used for developing a
   generalized calibration of the impedance probe. The results illustrated
   that BNN-based generalized calibration (RMSE < 0.04 m(3) m(-3)) performs
   better than the linear regression-based calibrations (RMSE > 0.04 m(3)
   m(-3)). Moreover, the performance of BNN-based generalized calibration
   was further improved by the inclusion of soil physical properties as
   input and yielded an RMSE value up to 0.0352 and 0.0366 m(3) m(-3)
   during training and cross-validation process, respectively. (C) 2020

   soil moisture simulation (1979-2012) over Eurasia at annual and seasonal
   time scales between two medium-resolution versions of the Beijing
   Climate Center Climate System Model (BCC-CSM)-one that is currently
   participating in phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
   (CMIP6), i.e., BCC-CSM2-MR, and the other, BCC-CSM1.1m, which
   participated in CMIP5. We show that BCC-CSM2-MR is more skillful in
   reproducing the climate mean states and standard deviations of soil
   moisture, with pattern correlations increased and biases reduced
   significantly. BCC-CSM2-MR performs better in capturing the first two
   primary patterns of soil moisture anomalies, where the period of the
   corresponding time series is closer to that of reference data.
   Comparisons show that BCC-CSM2-MR performs at a high level among
   multiple models of CMIP6 in terms of centered pattern correlation and
   ``amplitude of variation{''} (relative standard deviation). In general,
   the centered pattern correlation of BCC-CSM2-MR, ranging from 0.61 to
   0.87, is higher than the multi-model mean of CMIP6, and the relative
   standard deviation is 0.75, which surmounts the overestimations in most
   of the CMIP6 models. Due to the vital role played by precipitation in
   land-atmosphere interaction, possible causes of the improvement of soil
   moisture simulation are further related to precipitation in BCC-CSM2-MR.
   The results indicate that a better description of the relationship
   between soil moisture and precipitation and a better reproduction of the
   climate mean precipitation by the model may result in the improved
   performance of soil moisture simulation.},

Title = {Grazing, liming, and fertilization: Shifts on soil fertility and

Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},

Abstract = {Integrated crop-livestock systems are recognized for intensifying food
   production as long as adequate man-agement of grazing, fertilization,
   and liming is practiced. There is still a lack of information about the
   effect of these factors on the soil microbiological community. This
   study evaluated the effects of grazing, liming, and different P and K
   fertilization strategies on the soil microbial community and its
   relationship with soil chemical properties. For this purpose, a field
   experiment was established in 2017 on a subtropical Acrisol. Treatments
   consisted of two production systems: (i) integrated crop-livestock
   system (with winter sheep grazing) and (ii) specialized system
   (ungrazed), combined with two periods of P and K fertilization: (i)
   conventional fertilization (at soybean planting) and (ii) system
   fertilization (in the Italian ryegrass pasture). The effect of liming
   (with and without) was also evaluated. Eighteen months after lime
   application, the soil was sampled in the 0-5 and10-15 cm soil layers to
   evaluate soil chemical properties (pH, exchangeable Al, Ca, and Mg,
   available P and K, cation (Ca+Mg+K) saturation, and Al saturation) and
   soil microbial community composition. In the surface soil layer, a
   negative impact of lime application was observed for Gram+ bacteria (-29
   \%) and actinomycetes (-21 \%), consequently decreasing the total
   bacterial community (-26 \%) and total microbial biomass (-27 \%). This
   negative impact of liming on Gram+ bacteria and actinomycetes was
   negatively related to the increase in soil pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg
   concentrations, and positively related to Al saturation and available K.
   The combination of an integrated system or system fertilization with
   lime increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community 3.0-fold compared
   to a specialized system or conventional fertilization in the subsurface
   soil layer. In addition, sheep grazing increased saprophytic fungi
   biomass by 50 \% in the subsurface soil layer compared to the
   specialized system. These positive impacts on the soil fungal community
   were probably associated with increased plant residue input. Sheep
   grazing and the fertilization strategy did not affect soil chemical
   properties or the microbial community at the soil surface. Liming,
   system fertilization, and sheep grazing benefitted the soil fungal
   com-munity, thus improving soil health in highly weathered agricultural
   soils.},

Abstract = {The major issue in modern agriculture is long-term sustainability.
   Nutrient management by integrating organic manures and inorganic
   fertilizers may play a vital role in improving and sustaining crop
   productivity. A long-term field experiment (since 1984) comprising 11
   treatments with different combinations of inorganic and organic
   fertilizers such as farm yard manure (FYM), wheat cut straw (WCS) and
   Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata L.) as green manure (GM) was conducted to
   evaluate their effects on crop yield, nutrient accumulation and soil
   fertility status under a rice - wheat cropping system. The maximum grain
   yield of wheat was recorded in T-6, i.e. 50\% recommended dose of
   fertilizers (RDF) + 50\% nitrogen through FYM in rice and 100\% RDF in
   wheat (4291 kg ha(-1)) as compared to chemically fertilized plots T-5,
   i.e. 100\% RDF in both rice and wheat (3441 kg ha(-1)). The application
   of organic manures in combination with chemical fertilizers reduced soil
   pH and bulk density from 7.40 to 7.23 and 1.49 to 1.37 g cm(-3),
   respectively. Soil organic carbon (SOC), available soil nutrients and
   nutrient accumulation by crop were higher in integrated nutrient
   management-treated plots as compared to control. A positive and
   significant correlation was observed between SOC and available soil
   nitrogen (r = 0.987), phosphorus (r = 0.913) and potassium (r = 0.921).
   The results clearly suggest that integrated use of chemical fertilizers
   and organic manures on a long-term basis improves soil fertility and
   crop productivity with the potential to enhance soil sustainability},

Title = {Effects of Different Rollers and Rye Termination Methods on Soil
   Moisture and Cotton Production in a No-Till System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COTTON SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {24},
Number = {4},
Pages = {197-210},
Abstract = {In the southern U.S., rollers/crimpers are used to terminate cover crops
   approximately 3 weeks before planting cotton when the cover crop reaches
   >90\% termination. When spring is wet or cold, the 3-week period is
   reduced to keep recommended planting dates. A 3-year experiment was
   initiated in Alabama to determine the effectiveness of a 4-stage
   roller/crimper in increasing termination rates for cereal rye compared
   to 2-stage and spiral rollers/crimpers in rolling 1, 2, and 3 times over
   rye along with a single-pass smooth roller with glyphosate application.
   Effects of rye termination at 7, 14, and 21 days after rolling were
   assessed as were the effects on soil water conservation, cotton
   population, and yield. Seven days after rolling, the 4-stage, 2-stage,
   and spiral rollers rolling 3 times generated 96, 92, and 81\%
   termination, respectively. Termination with the smooth roller with
   glyphosate was 94\% and the control (no rolling) was 37\%. At 14 days,
   termination among rollers was 91 to 98\% and at 21 days no differences
   were found among rollers (99-100\%). The 4-stage roller 3 times had the
   highest average soil volumetric water content (VWC) of 16.1\%, whereas
   the spiral roller 1 time had the lowest (13.6\%). Rolled rye had higher
   VWC content averaging 14.7\% (12-cm surface layer) compared to the
   control (12.7\%). Rolling treatments affected cotton emergence only in
   2015; cotton population and yield were not affected. Seven days after
   rolling, the 4-stage and 2-stage roller/crimpers exceeded 90\% rye
   termination making earlier cotton planting possible if required by
   climatic conditions.},

Abstract = {Agriculture is a distinct sector of a country's economy. In recent
   years, new patterns have evolved in the agricultural industry. In
   conjunction with sensor scaling down and precision agriculture, the
   field of remote sensor networks, such as the wireless sensor network
   (WSN), was developed. Its major purpose is to make horticultural
   operations simpler to identify, assess, and manage. This paper uses the
   proposed DCNN to predict soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision
   agriculture farmers to reduce water consumption used for cultivation and
   increase production yield by comparing water content during various
   stages of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into
   agriculture. It also optimizes the water level for future irrigation
   decisions to maintain crop growth and water stability. The data must be
   served and stored in the form of a grid view, according to Apriori and
   GRU (gated recurrent unit). Using numerous sensor and parameter
   modelling methodologies, this system assists in the prediction of
   irrigation planning based on irrigation needs. The predicted parameters
   include soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This observed
   experimental data supports smart irrigation in crop production with a
   high yield and little water use. DCNN has a 98.5\% experimental result
   accuracy rate and the MSE value is predicted in DCNN 99.25\% of the
   time.},

Abstract = {An effective evaluation of soil fertility can provide a theoretical

   Based on 32 m x 32 m grid sampling, the soil organic matter, total N,
   total P, total K, available K, available P, salinity and soil pH were
   used as the soil fertility evaluation factors. And we integrated
   evaluation of the soil fertility using classical statistics,
   geostatistics and modified Nemoro fertility index. The result shows that
   the mean value of pH was 8.89 which showed alkalinity. The CV for
   organic matter, total N, total K, pH and available K were low variation.
   Others (total P, available P and salinity) were moderate variation. The
   nugget variances for organic matter and total were strong spatial
   autocorrelation. Others were between 0.418 and 0.5, indicating moderate
   spatial autocorrelation. The spatial distribution of each fertility
   index was not obvious. The P-s was within the range of 0.63-0.80, all
   fertility indicators surrounding graphics areas were small in Radar map,
   indicating the fertility level was classified as barren. The mean
   fertility index, P-i, of the soil was in the order: available K >
   salinity > total K > available P > pH > total P > organic matter > total
   N. The soil organic matter and total N were the main limiting factors
   restraining soil fertility. The spatial distribution patterns of soil
   index and P-s were complicated and had no regularity with patch
   distribution at field scale. The methods of increasing organic

Abstract = {To understand surface biogeophysical processes, accurately evaluating
   the geographical and temporal fluctuations of soil moisture is crucial.
   It is well known that the surface soil moisture content (SMC) affects
   soil reflectance at all solar spectrum wavelengths. Therefore, future
   satellite missions, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology
   mission, will be essential for mapping and monitoring global soil
   moisture changes. Our study compares two widely used moisture retrieval
   models: the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance
   (MARMIT) and the soil water parametric (SWAP)-Hapke model. We evaluated
   the SMC retrieval accuracy of these models using unmanned aerial systems
   (UAS) hyperspectral imagery and goniometer hyperspectral data.
   Laboratory analysis employed hyperspectral goniometer data of sediment
   samples from four locations reflecting diverse environments, while field
   validation used hyperspectral UAS imaging and coordinated ground truth
   collected in 2018 and 2019 from a barrier island beach at the Virginia
   Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research site. The (SWAP)-Hapke model
   achieves comparable accuracy to MARMIT using laboratory hyperspectral
   data but is less accurate when applied to UAS hyperspectral imagery than
   the MARMIT model. We proposed a modified version of the (SWAP)-Hapke
   model, which achieves better results than MARMIT when applied to
   laboratory spectral measurements; however, MARMIT's performance is still
   more accurate when applied to UAS imagery. These results are likely due
   to differences in the models' descriptions of multiply-scattered light
   and MARMIT's more detailed description of air-water interactions.},

   data assimilation in the APSIM model for improving agricultural
   forecastingacross the US Midwest},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {27},

Month = {MAR 16},
Abstract = {Today, the most popular approaches in agricultural forecasting leverage
   process-based crop models, crop monitoring data, and/or remote sensing
   imagery. Individually, each of these tools has its own unique advantages
   but is, nonetheless, limited in prediction accuracy, precision, or both.
   In this study we integrate in situ and remote sensing (RS) soil moisture
   observations with APSIM model through sequential data assimilation to
   evaluate the improvement in model predictions of downstream state
   variables across five experimental sites in the US Midwest. Four RS data
   products and in situ observations spanning 19 site years were used
   through two data assimilation approaches, namely ensemble Kalman filter
   (EnKF) and generalized ensemble filter (GEF), to constrain model states
   at observed time steps and estimate joint background and observation
   error matrices. Then, the assimilation's impact on estimates of soil
   moisture, yield, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), tile
   drainage, and nitrate leaching was assessed across all site years. When
   assimilating in situ observations, the accuracy of soil moisture
   forecasts in the assimilation layers was improved by reducing RMSE by an
   average of 17 \% for 10 cm and similar to 28 \% for 20 cm depth soil
   layer across all site years. These changes also led to improved
   simulation of soil moisture in deeper soil layers by an average of 12
   \%. Although crop yield was improved by an average of 23 \%, the
   greatest improvement in yield accuracy was demonstrated in site years
   with higher water stress, where assimilation served to increase
   available soil water for crop uptake. Alternatively, estimates of annual
   tile drainage and nitrate leaching were not well constrained across the
   study sites. Trends in drainage constraint suggest the importance of
   including additional data constraint such as evapotranspiration. The
   assimilation of RS soil moisture showed a weaker constraint of
   downstream model state variables when compared to the assimilation of in
   situ soil moisture. The median reduction in soil moisture RMSE for
   observed soil layers was lower, on average, by a factor of 5. However,
   crop yield estimates were still improved overall with a median RMSE
   reduction of 17.2 \%. Crop yield prediction was improved when
   assimilating both in situ and remote sensing soil moisture observations,
   and there is strong evidence that yield improvement was higher when
   under water-stressed conditions. Comparisons of system performance
   across different combinations of remote sensing data products indicated
   the importance of high temporal resolution and accurate observation
   uncertainty estimates when assimilating surface soil moisture
   observations.},

Title = {Uncertainty analysis of eleven multisource soil moisture products in the

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {255},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental environmental variable for
   characterizing climate, land surface and atmosphere. In recent years,
   several SM products have been developed based on remote sensing (RS),
   land surface model (LSM) or land data assimilation system (LDAS).
   However, little knowledge is available in understanding spatial patterns
   of the uncertainty of different SM products and potential regional
   drivers over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a complex environment for
   accurate SM estimation. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the
   SM uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and a
   generalized additive model (GAM) in terms of underlying surface
   characteristics (sand fraction, soil organic matter, vegetation, land
   surface temperature, and topography) and near-ground meteorology
   (precipitation and air temperature) in the third pole environment over
   the 2015-2018 period. Eleven SM products are involved in this work,
   including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean
   Salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency
   (JAXA), Land Surface Parameter Model (LPRM), Climate Change Initiative -
   Active/Combined (CCI\_A/CCI\_C), Global Land Data Assimilation System
   (GLDAS), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim
   reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model
   product a/b (GLEAM\_a/GLEAM\_b), and Random Forest Soil Moisture (RFSM).
   Results show that most of the SM products perform well across QTP, while
   SMOS-IC is strongly affected by radio-frequency interference in this
   region, JAXA has a relatively higher noise level over QTP, and LPRM has
   larger relative uncertainties (RUs) in the southeast of QTP. Nonlinear
   regression analysis demonstrates that variations of RUs in SMOS-IC and
   JAXA are driven by topography, while LPRM's are mainly controlled by
   vegetation. In addition, two groups of opposite (positive/negative)
   effects from topography and vegetation, topography and precipitation,
   and precipitation and land surface temperature affect the spatial
   variations of RUs in CCI\_A, RFSM, and ERA-Interim, respectively.
   Meanwhile, more complex relationships are found between multiple surface
   factors and RUs of different products. In general, the underlying
   surface factors explain on average 39.41\% and 28.34\% of the variations
   in RS and LSM/LDAS SM RUs, respectively. Comparatively, the near-ground
   meteorology factors have a slightly larger effect on LSM/LDAS products
   than that on RS products.},

Abstract = {Long-term excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer induces secondary
   salinization of soil, which results in inhibiting plant growth. In
   addition, soil moisture deficiency also affects plant growth. To
   investigate the effects of excessive nitrogen fertilizer and soil
   moisture deficiency on the antioxidant enzyme system, plant water
   relations analyzed through pressure-volume (P-V) curve, and
   photosynthetic light response parameters in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
   L. Myoko) seedlings, an indoor experiment of about 50 d was conducted
   using two irrigation water amounts based on field capacity (soil
   moisture deficiency: 50\%-80\%; adequate water: 70\%-80\%), two nitrogen
   fertilizer rates (moderate nitrogen; excessive nitrogen fertilizer:
   0.585 g/pot) and two types of irrigation water (tap water and microbial
   diluent). The results showed that excessive nitrogen fertilizer (N) and
   soil moisture deficiency (W) reduced the biomass of tomato seedlings. In
   comparison to CK (combination of adequate water and tap water quality),
   microbial dilution (EM) increased plant biomass by 5.2\%. Also, the
   nitrogen application increased chlorophyll relative contents (SPAD). The
   maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pc) decreased with nitrogen application
   and increased with EM application and irrigation amount. Excessive
   nitrogen application increased the plant nitrate reductase activity
   (NR). The plant NR in the N treatment showed a 13.0\% increase compared
   to CK, and the plant NR in the treatment of nitrogen application with
   water deficiency (WN) increased 34.0\% compared to water deficiency (W).
   After applying excessive nitrogen, N, EM-N, WN, EM-WN respectively
   increased the plant nitrate reductase activity by 13.0\%, 22.9\%,
   34.0\%, and 28.6\%, compared with the corresponding treatment with
   moderate nitrogen (i.e., CK, EM, W and EM-W). In addition, the
   activities of antioxidant enzymes {[}superoxide dismutase (SOD),
   peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT)] in four treatments of nitrogen
   application (N, EM-N, WN, EM-WN) also increased significantly. Both soil
   moisture and nitrogen fertilizer significantly affect the parameters of
   osmotic adjustment, which is manifested in the reduction of osmotic
   potential (pi FT), and the increase in the osmotic concentration (Cosm)
   and concentration difference (Delta Cosm). But the decrease in the
   relative water content of apoplast (zeta ap) indicated that water
   deficiency and excessive nitrogen reduced the water absorption and water
   retention capacity of tomatoes to a certain extent. In conclusion,
   excessive nitrogen application and soil moisture deficiency inhibit
   plant growth significantly in this experiment. Meanwhile, microbial
   dilution can alleviate excessive nitrogen fertilizer and water stress to
   some extent, but the effect was not significant.},

Title = {A Soil Moisture Retrieval Method for Reducing Topographic Effect: A Case
   Study on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau With SMOS Data},
Journal = {IEEE JOURNAL OF SELECTED TOPICS IN APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATIONS AND REMOTE
   SENSING},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {The topography can be very important for passive microwave remote
   sensing of soil moisture due to its complex influence on the emitted
   brightness temperature observed by a satellite microwave radiometer. In
   this study, a methodology of using the first brightness Stokes parameter
   (i.e., the sum of vertical and horizontal polarization brightness
   temperature) observed by the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) was
   proposed to improve the soil moisture retrieval under complex
   topographic conditions. The applicability of the proposed method is
   validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements collected at four
   networks (Pali, Naqu, Maqu, and Wudaoliang) on the Qinghai-Tibetan
   Plateau. The results over Pali, which is a typical mountainous area,
   showed that soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes
   parameter are in better agreement with the in-situ measurements (the
   correlation coefficient R > 0.75 and unbiased root mean square error
   <0.04 m(3)/m(3)) compared with that using the single-polarization
   brightness temperature. At the other three networks with relatively
   flatter terrains, soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness
   Stokes parameter are found to be comparable to the single-polarization
   retrievals. On the contrary, the maximum bias of the retrieved soil
   moisture caused by topographic effects exceeds 0.1 m(3)/m(3) when using
   vertical or horizontal polarization alone, which is far beyond the
   expected accuracy (0.04 m(3)/m(3)) of SMOS satellite. In the regions on
   the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau where the vegetation effect can be ignored,
   soil moisture retrieved using horizontal polarization brightness
   temperature is generally underestimated, overestimated when using
   vertical polarization brightness temperature. It is reasonable due to
   the polarization rotation effect (depolarization) caused by the
   topographic effects. It is concluded that the proposed method for soil
   moisture retrieval using the first brightness Stokes parameter has a
   great potential in reducing the influence of topographic effects.},

Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Considering variations in surface soil moisture (SSM) is essential in
   improving crop yield and irrigation scheduling. Today, most remotely
   sensed soil moisture products have difficulties in resolving irrigation
   signals at the plot scale. This study aims to use Sentinel-1 radar
   backscatter and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to estimate SSM at high
   spatial (10 m) and temporal resolution (at least 5 days) over an
   agricultural domain. Three supervised machine learning algorithms,
   multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and
   linear regression models, were trained to estimate changes in SSM based
   on the variation in surface reflectance and backscatter over five
   different crops. Results showed that CNN is the best algorithm as it
   understands spatial relations and better represents two-dimensional
   images. Estimated values for SSM were in agreement with in-situ
   measurements regardless of the crop type, with RMSE=0.0292 (cm3/cm3) and
   R2=0.92 for the Sentinel-2 derived SSM and RMSE=0.0317 (cm3/cm3) and
   R2=0.84 for the Sentinel-1 soil moisture data. Moreover, a time series
   of estimated SSM based on Sentinel-1 (SSM-S1), Sentinel-2 (SSM-S2), and
   SSM derived from SMAP-Sentinel1 was compared. The developed SSM data
   showed a significantly higher mean SSM state over irrigated agriculture
   relative to the rainfed cropland area during the irrigation season. The
   multiple comparisons (fisher LSD) were tested and found that these two
   groups are different (pvalue=0.035 in 95\% confidence interval).
   Therefore, by employing the maximum likelihood classification on the SSM
   data, we managed to map the irrigated agriculture. The overall accuracy
   of this unsupervised classification is 77\%, with a kappa coefficient of
   65\%.},

Abstract = {Maintaining the homogeneity of soil nitrogen (N) and plant vigor across
   agricultural fields is a major concern for farmers and agricultural
   scheme planners, particularly fields that are irrigated through
   pressurized systems, such as center pivots. Therefore, this study was
   carried out on a 30 hm(2) potato field located 650 km south of Riyadh,
   the capital city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to investigate the
   impacts of the center pivot irrigation distribution uniformity on the
   crop development and the spatial distribution of residual soil N.
   Irrigation performance test was designed to investigate water
   application rate and distribution uniformities. The overall water
   application uniformity coefficients (Cu), determined through
   Christiansen (Cud) and Heerman (CuH) methods, were determined at 81.29\%
   and 80.64\%, respectively. However, the overall water distribution
   uniformity (Du) was determined at 70\%. A considerable variability in
   the distribution uniformity of irrigation water was observed across the
   experimental field (a Du value of 67\% over the medium spans compared to
   a Du value of 88\% over the inner spans). Results of this study showed a
   linear correlation between the irrigation water distribution uniformity
   and the soil N (R-2=0.88). On the other hand, the vegetation cover
   distribution, indicated by the Cumulative Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (CNDVI), was not found to be much responsive to the
   irrigation distribution uniformity (R-2=0.11). A time series of
   successive NDVI maps extracted throughout the potato crop growth stages
   showed a consistent trend in the distribution of NDVI across the field,
   with R 2 values that ranged between 0.25-0.73.},

Title = {Evaluating the Potential and Challenges of an Uncertainty Quantification
   Method for Long Short-Term Memory Models for Soil Moisture Predictions},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {56},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recently, recurrent deep networks have shown promise to harness newly
   available satellite-sensed data for long-term soil moisture projections.
   However, to be useful in forecasting, deep networks must also provide
   uncertainty estimates. Here we evaluated Monte Carlo dropout with an
   input-dependent data noise term (MCD+N), an efficient uncertainty
   estimation framework originally developed in computer vision, for
   hydrologic time series predictions. MCD+N simultaneously estimates a
   heteroscedastic input-dependent data noise term (a trained error model
   attributable to observational noise) and a network weight uncertainty
   term (attributable to insufficiently constrained model parameters).
   Although MCD+N has appealing features, many heuristic approximations
   were employed during its derivation, and rigorous evaluations and
   evidence of its asserted capability to detect dissimilarity were
   lacking. To address this, we provided an in-depth evaluation of the
   scheme's potential and limitations. We showed that for reproducing soil
   moisture dynamics recorded by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
   mission, MCD+N indeed gave a good estimate of predictive error, provided
   that we tuned a hyperparameter and used a representative training data
   set. The input-dependent term responded strongly to observational noise,
   while the model term clearly acted as a detector for physiographic
   dissimilarity from the training data, behaving as intended. However,
   when the training and test data were characteristically different, the
   input-dependent term could be misled, undermining its reliability.
   Additionally, due to the data-driven nature of the model, data noise
   also influences network weight uncertainty, and therefore the two
   uncertainty terms are correlated. Overall, this approach has promise,
   but care is needed to interpret the results.},

Abstract = {Integrated ecological farming combines rice growing with aquaculture,

   rice-fish-duck system (RFD), rice-vegetable cropping system (RVS) and
   conventional rice system (CRS) in the PRD. SOC and phosphorus fractions
   were significantly influenced by cropping systems. RFD significantly
   increased SOC and phosphorus in the soil. Soil phosphorus was dominated
   by moderately labile P (40.67-49.41\%). RFD also significantly increased
   soil microbial biomass carbon, microbial biomass phosphorus, and acid
   phosphatase activity (ACP) by 67.68, 46.68, and 15.87\% compared to RVS,
   and by 134.14, 65.99, and 30.20\% compared to CRS, respectively. SOC and

Abstract = {A cokriging model using three variables is developed to estimate
   bare-surface soil moisture content based on multi-temporal
   synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) data. This model utilizes
   cross-semivariogram function to take into account spatially varied
   correlation among multiple variables. Here, five sentinel-1 SAR scenes
   were acquired on different dates using the interferometric wide-swath
   (IW) mode and a mean incidence angle of 39.02 degrees to build the
   backscatter temporal-ratio in VV polarization. This algorithm is
   generally based on the assumption of contributions of soil moisture and
   surface roughness to the backscattering coefficient under the given
   radar configurations. In this study, soil moisture is the target
   variable, and the surface roughness and backscatter temporal-ratio in VV
   polarization are the auxiliary variables. A cross-semivariogram
   relationship is formulated among those three spatial variables; then
   ordinary cokriging is used, based on that cross-semivariogram formula,
   to estimate the spatial distribution of bare soil moisture content. The
   root mean square error (RMSE) of soil-moisture retrieval ranges from
   2.62 to 2.66 vol\%. The new empirical model described in this paper will
   provide new insights into the study of soil environments.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Understanding physical processes in nature, including the occurrence of
   slow-onset natural disasters such as droughts and landslides, requires
   knowledge of the change in soil moisture between two points in time. The
   study was conducted on a relatively bare soil, and the change in soil
   moisture was examined with an index called Normalized radar Backscatter
   soil Moisture Index (NBMI) using Sentinel-1 satellite data. Along with
   soil moisture measured with a probe on the ground, a study of
   correlation with satellite imagery was conducted using a Multiple Linear
   Regression (MLR) model. Furthermore, the Dubois model was used to
   predict soil moisture. Results have shown that NBMI on a logarithmic
   scale provides a good representation of soil moisture change with R-2
   similar to 86\%. The MLR model showed a positive correlation of soil
   moisture with the co-polarized backscatter coefficient, but an opposite
   correlation with the surface roughness and angle of incidence. The
   results of the Dubois model showed poor correlation of 44.37\% and
   higher RMSE error of 17.1, demonstrating the need for detailed and
   accurate measurement of surface roughness as a prerequisite for
   simulating the model. Of the three approaches, index-based measurement
   has been shown to be the most rapid for understanding soil moisture
   change and has the potential to be used for understanding some
   mechanisms of natural disasters under similar soil conditions.},

Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {424},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Alternate wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation influences soil nutrient
   cycling and the functioning of soil microorganisms. However, the effects
   of AWD on organic nitrogen (ON) partitioning in rice-microbe ecosystems
   and soil microbial communities are poorly understood. A root-box
   microcosm experiment with two rice varieties (Nipponbare, Nip; Yangdao
   6, YD6), two irrigation regimes (conventional flood irrigation (CF);
   AWD) and three N application levels (zero N, N0; medium N, N1; high N,
   N2) was performed based on the 13C,15N-labelled glycine and
   13C-phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) techniques. Compared to CF, AWD
   increased soil dissolved oxygen, microbial growth and the enzymes
   related to N transformation, thus enhancing rice growth and the N
   utilization index (NUI). Approximately 4.9-10.3\% and 7.7-13.6\% of the
   exogenous glycine was directly utilized by Nip and YD6 seedlings,
   respectively, and its ratio increased with increasing N levels, whereas
   4.4-11.2\% and 4.6-10.3\% were incorporated into soil microbes. It seems
   that rice has an appreciable capacity to utilize organic N despite
   fierce competition with soil microbes. The 13C:15N ratio showed that
   12.5-37.5\% and 11.0-41.0\% of the added glycine was taken up intact by
   soil microorganisms in the rhizospheres of Nip and YD6. At the N1 and N2
   levels, AWD increased rice 15N-glycine uptake but decreased microbial
   15N-glycine uptake. Rice intact glycine uptake and soil inorganic N
   contents were positively correlated with rice biomass and NUI,
   indicating that the enhanced inorganic N under AWD is beneficial for
   soil ON availability and rice growth. Gram-negative and general bacteria
   were the dominant competitors with rice for soil ON. AWD increased the
   contents of gram-negative bacteria and fungi and the ratio of
   fungi:bacteria in rhizosphere soils. Collectively, AWD creates a good
   rhizosphere oxygen environment for rice and microbial growth. ON
   partitioning in the rice-microbe system and the adaptive adjustment of
   the microbial community play important roles in modulating soil
   nutrients for optimal rice growth.},

Abstract = {The use of compost tea has increased in organic agriculture as a
   substitute for herbicides and inorganic fertilizers, but the relative
   effects of compost tea produced via different methods are largely
   unknown. We examined the effects of compost tea on soil and plant
   chemistry and microbial community enzyme activity on an organic
   blueberry farm in Minnesota, USA. We randomly assigned plants to one of
   three compost tea treatments: aerated compost tea under ambient
   temperature, heated and aerated compost tea, and a control treatment.
   Heated and aerated compost tea increased soil percent nitrogen compared
   to the other treatments, and decreased activity of
   beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme involved in chitin
   degradation, compared to the aerated-only treatment. We propose that the
   production method of compost tea has a significant effect on its
   efficacy as an organic soil amendment.},

Title = {Using temporal variability of land surface temperature and normalized
   vegetation index to estimate soil moisture condition on forest areas by
   means of remote sensing},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},

Abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) against Vegetation Index (VI) scatterplot
   is a base concept of Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) which
   is a widely used drought index taking into account evaporation over
   heterogenic area. The main advantage of using TVDI is that it reflects
   rather a soil moisture conditions than volumetric soil moisture itself.
   This is particularly useful when the aim of conducting research is to
   assess water availability for plants rather than volumetric soil
   moisture at some depth. Results that have been obtained so far using
   indices based on LST-VI scatterplot proved their effectiveness in
   meadows, pastures or crops but were not satisfactory enough over forest
   areas. An important limitation of using TVDI is a need to collect LST
   and VI data from heterogenic areas, to provide different soil moisture
   conditions which is often difficult to ensure.In this paper, we proposed
   a new approach to the TVDI calculation method in which we use temporal
   vari-ability of soil moisture conditions (shown in different satellite
   images of the same area) instead of their spatial
   heterogeneity.Calculations were conducted over the forest area in Tuczno
   Poland. To calculate the temporal TVDI model 4 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS scenes
   were used, and calculation was performed in Python 3 using open-source
   packages. The average moisture conditions of each chosen scene were
   validated using field data, namely evapotranspira-tion determined from
   an eddy covariance.},

Title = {Temperature Effects in AMSR2 Soil Moisture Products and Development of a
   Removal Method Using Data at Ascending and Descending Overpasses},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Number = {9},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is among the most essential variables in hydrology and
   earth science. Many satellite missions, such as AMSR-E/2, have been
   launched to observe it in broader spatial coverage to overcome the
   shortage of in situ observations. However, the satellite soil moisture
   products have been reported to comprise errors caused by the so-called
   ``temperature effects{''} widely observed in dielectrically measured in
   situ volumetric soil water content (SWC). In this work, we confirmed the
   existence of these errors in AMSR2 soil moisture products. A new
   algorithm was developed to remove these errors using satellite data at
   ascending and descending overpasses. The application of this algorithm
   to both satellite and in situ data of SWC and soil temperature at the
   Mongolia site shows that the difference between SWC values at ascending
   and descending overpasses caused by temperature effects is effectively
   removed. We assess the impact of this removal method on satellite data
   by comparing it with in situ data, utilizing metrics such as the
   correlation coefficient and other widely adopted evaluation methods. It
   is shown that the difference between the original and corrected in situ
   SWC is much smaller than that between AMSR2 and in situ SWC, either
   corrected or not. The results indicate that the metric values between
   the corrected AMSR2 and in situ SWC, after removing apparent differences
   caused by temperature effects, slightly improved compared to those
   between the original AMSR2 and in situ SWC. Though these findings imply
   that the removed errors may not be the most dominant, considering the
   current significant difference between AMSR2 and in situ SWC, the
   removal makes the ascending and descending data have close
   characteristics. It may allow using data at both ascending and
   descending overpasses and double the temporal resolution of AMSR2 SWC
   data.},

Abstract = {The evidence shows that soil moisture has an important influence on
   North American monsoon (NAM) precipitation. This study evaluates the
   local and nonlocal feedbacks of soil moisture on summer (June-September)
   precipitation in the NAM region using observational data. We applied a
   multivariate statistical method known as the Stepwise Generalized
   Equilibrium Feedback Assessment (SGEFA) to control for internal
   atmospheric variability and sea surface temperature (SST) forcings so
   that we could isolate the impact of soil moisture feedbacks on NAM
   precipitation. Our results identify feedback pathways between soil
   moisture and precipitation in the NAM region and in the southern Rocky
   Mountains (SRM) region. Wet soils in the SRM result in lower-than-normal
   local surface temperature, weaker water vapor transport from the eastern
   Pacific and the Gulf of California (GOC), and less monsoon
   precipitation. Precipitation over the U.S. Great Plains also
   significantly increases when there are wet soils in the SRM. This occurs
   due to an enhanced water vapor influx into this region. On the other
   hand, anomalously wet soils in the NAM region increase NAM precipitation
   by enhancing local moist static energy and increasing the strength of
   the monsoonal circulation. Our observational results using SGEFA agree
   well with previous numerical modeling studies. This study highlights the
   critical role of land-atmosphere interactions for understanding NAM
   variability.},

Abstract = {There is a growing demand for an efficient noninvasive method for
   monitoring stabilization sites. Geophysical monitoring method was
   applied in a pilot site. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) and
   time-domain induced polarization (TDIP) surveys showed that the topsoil

   251.8 and 74.8 +/- 16.9 O-m, respectively, and a chargeability of 11.7
   +/- 7.6 and 6.0 +/- 2.3 mV/V, respectively. Both methods distinguished
   the stabilized layer and topsoil, and 3D ERT and TDIP provided
   additional infor-mation related to the long-term stability of the
   stabilized site. The influence of the electrode type on electrical
   resistivity and chargeability noise was negligible. As the water content
   in the soil increased, the electrical resistivity and chargeability
   decreased in the stabilized soil, while chargeability increased at a
   water content of 20-30\% in the topsoil. This study highlights the
   potential of geophysical methods for monitoring stabilized sites.},

Title = {Forms and balance of soil potassium from a long-term integrated

Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {207},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The presence of animal grazing at different intensities in integrated
   crop livestock systems (ICLS) may affect the forms and the balance of K
   in the soil, especially after many years. The objective of this study
   was to evaluate different K forms and their balance for 17 years with
   ICLS. ICLS experimental area used no-till practices with different
   grazing intensities of cattle in winter pasture (black oat + annual
   ryegrass) and soybean production in the summer season. The experiment
   started in May 2001 at a location with a Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol). The
   treatments consisted of varied grazing intensities: intensive grazing
   (IG) at 10 cm of pasture height, moderate grazing (MG) at 20 cm of
   pasture height, and a no grazing (NG) treatment. The experimental design
   was a randomized block design with three replicates. Soil samples were
   collected in 2001, 2007, 2012 and 2017 in 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm
   of soil layers. Desorption of K was measured using the Mehlich-1 method
   and the results were fitted to first-order kinetic equations to obtain
   readily and potentially available K content. Total K was determined by
   X-ray fluorescence, and the unavailable K by the difference between the
   total K and potentially available K. Long-term no-till ICLS resulted in
   an increase in more readily available K forms in the soil surface. The
   increase was especially prominent in the no-grazing treatment due to the
   greater amount of K left in the plant residues. Regardless of grazing
   intensity, soybean cultivation was the controlling component of the soil
   nutrient budget, representing 98.6 \% of the total amount of K exported.
   Animal outputs represent only 1.4 \% of total K exported and are
   therefore the recycling component of the system. Although meat
   production in ICLS represents only a very small fraction of the amount
   of K exported from the system, K tends to become less available in the
   grazed treatments in the long-term.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Soil moisture and vegetation water content play an important role in
   studies involving vegetation, drought, and climate change. The present
   paper gives details of how to calculate the Soil Moisture Index (SMI),
   Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI), and Normalized Difference
   Water Index (NDWI) using Landsat 7 ETM + and Landsat 8 OLI (Operational
   Land Imager) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) data and how spatially
   and temporally it has been changed over Palakkad District, Kerala. The
   present study develops an image processing method using band 3 (Green),
   band 4(Red), band 5 (NIR), band 6 (SWIR 1), and band 10 (TIR) of Landsat
   8 and band 2 (Green), band 3 (Red), band 4 (NIR), band 5 (SWIR) and band
   6 (TIR) of Landsat 7 data for determining the different spectral
   indices. The relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are based on experimental
   parameterization for soil moisture index. Both LST and NDVI are
   considered indispensable data to obtain SMI calculation. The statistical
   analysis of NDVI and LST was exposed in the standardized regression
   coefficient. The study found a weak negative correlation between NDVI
   and LST in both 2001 (R-2 = 0.37) and 2021 (R-2 = 0.16). As the LST
   increases, the vegetative cover reduces due to the record of high
   temperatures in the study area. The SMI result for 2021 shows that the
   majority of the study area experienced extreme anomalies when compared
   to the 2001 result. Second, a significant negative correlation existed
   between SMI and LST (R-2 = 0.664 in 2001 and R-2 = 1 in 2021), which
   indicates that the surface soil moisture reduces with LST. The
   normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) value ranges from - 0.71 to
   0.75 in 2001 and - 0.33 to 0.40 in 2021. In 2001 and 2021, the
   normalized difference water index (NDWI) ranges from - 0.47 to 0.64 and
   - 0.531 to 0.154, respectively. Therefore, the current study gives a
   clear understanding of considerable variations in soil moisture and
   vegetation water content in the Palakkad District during the study
   period.},

   utilization: a perspective on soil nutrient and root system
   compatibility},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {Introduction The depth of fertilizer application significantly
   influences soil nitrate concentration (SNC), sunflower root length
   density (RLD), sunflower nitrogen uptake (SNU), and yield. However,
   current studies cannot precisely capture subtle nutrient variations
   between soil layers and their complex relationships with root growth.
   They also struggle to assess the impact of different fertilizer
   application depths on sunflower root development and distribution as
   well as their response to the spatial and temporal distribution of
   nutrients.Methods The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM)
   model was employed to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of
   nitrogen distribution in the soil at three controlled-release fertilizer
   (CRF) placement depths: 5, 15, and 25 cm. This study investigated the
   characteristics of the root system regarding nitrogen absorption and
   utilization and analyzed their correlation with sunflower yield
   formation. Furthermore, this study introduced the modified Jaccard index
   (considering the compatibility between soil nitrate and root length
   density) to analyze soil-root interactions, providing a deeper insight
   into how changes in CRF placement depth affect crop growth and nitrogen
   uptake efficiency.Results The results indicated that a fertilization
   depth of 15 cm improved the modified Jaccard index by 6.60\% and 7.34\%
   compared to 5 cm and 25 cm depths, respectively, maximizing sunflower
   yield (an increase of 9.44\%) and nitrogen absorption rate (an increase
   of 5.40\%). This depth promoted a greater Root Length Density (RLD),
   with an increases of 11.95\% and 16.42\% compared those at 5 cm and 25
   cm, respectively, enhancing deeper root growth and improving nitrogen
   uptake. In contrast, shallow fertilization led to higher nitrate
   concentrations in the topsoil, whereas deeper fertilization increased
   the nitrate concentrations in the deeper soil layers.Discussion These
   results provide valuable insights for precision agriculture and
   sustainable soil management, highlighting the importance of optimizing
   root nitrogen absorption through tailored fertilization strategies to
   enhance crop production efficiency and minimize environmental impact.},

   thermal imaging techniques to detect specific superficial and internal
   structures of a historical earth-filled dam. Longitudinal and
   transversal profiles of a typical fishpond dam in the Czech Republic
   were measured. The dam was constructed during the fifteenth century, but
   has since gone through some minor reconstruction. The aims of the
   applied geophysical methods are to detect and localize the boundary of
   the dam foundation, new earth material from reconstruction, the cone of
   water depression, the reservoir's outlet location, potential internal
   erosion, cavities, and heterogeneity in water content pattern and any
   other anomalies. The primary results show that ERT is suitable to detect
   dam stratification and large anomalies. The UAV monitoring system
   provided reliable data for a surface temperature distribution map which
   corresponded well to topsoil water content and electrical resistivity.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key land surface parameter that reflects conditions
   of drought in agricultural areas, such that variations in soil moisture
   significantly impact agricultural production. At a large spatial scale,
   soil moisture can be indicated using the temperature vegetation drought
   index (TVDI), which is based on soil moisture monitoring. Such metrics
   allow us to know whether or not the soil in a region is experiencing
   drought. The TVDI can be estimated by using either the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) or the enhanced vegetation index
   (EVI) combined with land surface temperature (LST) data. Our objectives
   were to study the applicability of the NDVI-based TVDI (TVDINDVI) and
   EVI-based TVDI (TVDIEVI) in the monitoring of soil moisture at a large
   time-space scale. The TVDI(NDVI)and TVDI(EVI)were calculated by
   constructing a feature space based on the NDVI (or EVI) and LST to
   obtain the corresponding dry/wet-edge equation. By establishing a
   correlation relationship between the TVDIs and soil moisture at soil
   depths of 0-10, 0-40, 0-100, and 0-200 cm, the applicability of the
   TVDI(EVI)and TVDI(NDVI)was investigated for seven different climatic
   regions in mainland China. The relationships between soil moisture at
   the 0-10-cm depth and the NDVI (or EVI) in cold and warm seasons were
   obtained. Linear functions of soil moisture and the TVDINDVI(TVDIEVI)
   were constructed. From the results, both the TVDI(NDVI)and TVDI(EVI)were
   more suitable for monitoring soil moisture at the 0-10-cm depth than at
   the other depths. The regions that had the best correlations between
   soil moisture and the TVDINDVI(TVDIEVI) were in northwestern China
   during the cold season and southeastern China during the warm season
   (from April to September), meaning that the TVDI was more applicable in
   these region/season combinations. The TVDI(NDVI)showed better
   performance in reflecting soil moisture conditions than the TVDIEVI,
   especially in the warm season. The applicability of the TVDI(EVI)for
   soil moisture at the 0-10-cm depth was better than that of the
   TVDI(NDVI)in northwestern China. However, in the other regions, the
   TVDI(NDVI)performed better. The performance of TVDINDVI(TVDIEVI) was
   better than TVDIEVI(TVDINDVI) under different circumstances, which was
   related to the goodness of fit for wet/dry-edge equations, natural
   variability of NDVI/EVI/LST, depths, changes in seasons (vegetation
   cover), and regions. This research compared the applications of the TVDI
   in China comprehensively.},

Title = {Combined 2D- and 3D ERT monitoring as a geophysical tool for
   investigating spatial and temporal soil moisture fluctuations in a
   pine-beech forest},
Journal = {TREES FORESTS AND PEOPLE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {As climate change continues, forests are increasingly suffering from
   drought stress, which is leading to widespread forest dieback, but also
   to increased mortality of individual trees. In this regard, the impact
   of small-scale differences in water availability on individual trees has
   not yet been sufficiently studied to determine possible responses of
   different tree species to future droughts. Since conventional soil
   moisture monitoring and sampling methods only consider single points or
   small volumes, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is becoming
   increasingly important to cover a larger survey area and to detect
   small-scale heterogeneities with regard to soil properties and soil
   moisture. The current study describes the application of a combined two-
   and three-dimensional geoelectrical monitoring approach with daily
   measurements over two years (May 2021 - April 2023) in a forest
   ecosystem in Lower Franconia (northwestern Bavaria, Germany), which is
   strongly affected by climate change. Soil water content, soil matric
   potential, throughfall, and stem flow are also measured at the forest
   site as well as precipitation at an adjacent forest clearing. The
   seasonally (long-term) and precipitation-driven (short-term) temporal
   change of soil resistivity is correlated strongly with the measured soil
   water content and matric potential. The applied 3D-ERT approach also
   allowed a first three-dimensional monitoring of the subsurface below a
   European beech located in the middle of the measuring grid with a daily
   resolution. The corresponding results also provide first indications
   that besides soil moisture changes also chemical processes in the
   subsurface may influence temporal resistivity changes in the soil of
   forest sites. The results of this study show that daily 3D-ERT is very
   suitable for investigating small-scale as well as shortand long-term
   variations in soil moisture, which is becoming increasingly important
   for understanding the causal relationships considering tree mortality
   and the subsurface.},

   competition during establishment of tea in an organic production system},
Journal = {APPLIED SOIL ECOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {198},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Tea (Camellia sinensis) is an emerging crop in Florida and the
   southeastern United States. The impacts of different production system
   components, including ground covers are still unknown. In this study, we
   examined the effect of weed barrier cloth (WBC) ground cover compared to
   two living mulches, perennial peanut (PPC) and a crimson clover rotation
   (CCR), on plant performance, soil microbiome, and nitrogen (N) cycling
   during the establishment phase of tea grown in central Florida. Three
   years after installation, plants under WBC had significantly higher
   yields than those with the living mulches. The effect of groundcover on
   soil microbiome was evaluated via qPCR gene count estimation of
   N-cycling associated genes, as well as dilution plating to establish
   count and diversity of culturable soil fungi, bacteria and N fixing
   bacteria. Soil under PPC had higher concentrations of genes associated
   with N cycling and P solubilization and higher plate counts of
   culturable microbes, including N fixing bacteria, compared to soil under
   WBC. Of the two living mulches, PPC soil had significantly higher counts
   of ammonia oxidizing genes and cultured fungi and bacteria than CCR
   soil. The impacts of ground cover on N cycling were further examined
   through an in vitro soil incubation study and an in situ field study of
   fertilizer-amended and unamended soil under PPC and WBC. In the in vitro
   study, after 7 days of incubation, 47.3 \% of the supplied N was
   mineralized in PPC soil compared to 20.2 \% in WBC soil. Throughout the
   28-day incubation, the PPC treatment showed higher levels of nitrate
   than WBC. In the in situ microplot column field study, no significant
   differences were found in the overall amount of N mineralized, but
   differences in the timing of mineralization were observed: the highest
   nitrate concentration occurred at day 14 under PPC and day 28 under WBC.
   During the establishment period of tea, use of WBC may benefit plant
   growth; however, it may also result in changes in nutrient cycling
   microbial populations that alter the N mineralization rate of applied
   fertilizers compared to living mulch cover crops. Results of our study
   established foundational data on N mineralization from organic
   fertilizers in field grown tea. The rates of N mineralization from
   organic N fertilizer and soil microbial diversity under WBC and a legume
   cover crop estimated in this study will be of value for establishing
   sustainable tea production systems.},

Abstract = {Stage-dependent concomitant fortification of rice (Oryza sativa L.)
   varieties PB1612 and CO51 with microbial inoculants Trichoderma
   asperellum and Pseudomonas fluorescens as seed coating, seedling root
   inoculation and soil application enhanced growth, activated antioxidant
   enzymes and modulated defence-related genes in plants. Microbial
   inoculants improved shoot height, tiller numbers, fresh weight and dry
   biomass. Co-inoculation was more impactful in enhancing plant growth and
   development as compared to single inoculation. Single and co inoculation
   improved organic carbon (OC) and N, P and K content in the soil
   substantially. Mean values between control and co-inoculation varied
   significantly for OC in PB1612 (p0.001) and CO51 (p0.019) and phosphorus
   content in PB1612 (p0.044) and CO51 (p0.021). Microbial inoculation
   enhanced soil nutrients and increased their bioavailability for the
   plants. Total polyphenolics, flavonoids and protein content increased in
   the leaves following microbial inoculation. Enhanced non-enzymatic
   antioxidant parameters (ABTS, DPPH, Fe-ion reducing power and Fe-ion
   chelation) was found in microbe inoculated rice reflecting high free
   radical scavenging activity in polyphenolics-rich leaf extracts.
   Increased enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione
   reductase (GR), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (PO),
   glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase
   (CAT) showed improved ROS scavenging in rice plants having
   co-inoculation. Over-expression of PAL, cCuZn-SOD and CAT genes in
   microbial inoculated rice plants was recorded. The study concludes that
   plant stage-wise concomitant fortification by microbial inoculants could
   play multi-pronged manifestations at physiological, biochemical and
   molecular level in rice to positively influence growth, development and
   defense attributes in plants.},

Title = {Effect of soil fertility on the allocation of nitrogen derived from
   different maize residue parts in the soil-plant system},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {379},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Crop residue incorporation is an effective agricultural management to
   enhance soil organic carbon and nitrogen (N) sequestration, which
   inevitably affects the crop N uptake, and consequently the allocation of
   N in the soil-plant system. However, to what extent the crop residue
   type and soil fertility moderate the contribution and recovery of maize
   (Zea mays. L) residue-derived N (residue-N) in the soil-plant system is
   poorly understood. Therefore, a 2-year in situ experiment was conducted
   on an Alfisol with high fertility (HF) and low fertility (LF), along
   with the application of 15 N-labeled maize root or straw (both stem and
   leaf) residues. The results showed that the HF treatment had a smaller
   proportion of residue-N in total N uptake compared with the LF treatment
   (on average of 2.0\% vs. 3.6\%), but with a larger recovery rate (on
   average of 23.5\% vs. 12.8\%). The application of straw residues
   increased the proportion of residue-N in plant total N compared with
   that from the application of root residues in the HF treatment. The
   percentage of residue-N in total soil N (TSN) and the residue-N recovery
   in the LF soil were 60.7-108.5\% and 9.6-25.8\% higher than those in the
   HF soil, respectively. The proportion of root-derived N (root-N) in TSN
   was significantly higher than that of straw-derived N (straw-N) in the
   LF soil. In addition, total residue-N recovery rates were similar among
   all residue-amended treatments. The results indicated that the soil with
   high fertility could increase residue-N utilization by plant, especially
   the straw-N, while the soil with low fertility favored the accumulation
   of the residue-N in soil, especially the root-N, and its low fertility
   was more likely to be improved. Overall, soil fertility and residue type
   could significantly affect the allocation of maize residue-N in the
   soil-plant system.},

Title = {Effects of cassava allelochemicals on rubber tree pathogens, soil
   microorganisms, and soil fertility in a rubber tree-cassava
   intercropping system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RUBBER RESEARCH},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {23},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)-cassava (Manihot esculenta)
   intercropping system is one of the most popular intercropping patterns
   for small-holder rubber planters. However, this practice is not
   recommended in some rubber-producing countries, since it is believed
   that the rubber tree and cassava share some identical pathogens and that
   the intercropping system will deplete soil fertility. The effects of
   cassava allelochemicals on rubber tree pathogens have never been
   reported. Using controlled plate tests, pot tests, and field
   experiments, this study aimed to assess the possible adverse effects
   that cassavas may impart to rubber plantations. The results showed: (1)
   although the leaf extract, decomposed leaf extract and root exudates of
   cassava inhibited or had no effect on the mycelial growth of the rubber
   tree pathogenCorynespora cassiicola,10 mg mL(-1)and 100 mg mL(-1)cassava
   leaf water extracts and testing concentrations of cassava root
   extraction significantly promoted the mycelial growth of the rubber tree
   pathogenRigidoporus lignosus, which increased the risk of rubber tree
   white root disease; (2) the overall soil fertility was increased
   significantly in the rubber tree-cassava intercropping system. However,
   the soil phosphorus content was reduced significantly in the field
   experiment; (3) the average girth of rubber trees was significantly
   reduced, and the girth uniformity was decreased in the intercropping
   system. Based on the experiment results, we suggested that an optimised
   fertiliser recommendation, particularly on the phosphorus amount, should
   be developed and implemented for the rubber tree-cassava intercropping
   system. In addition, since the intercropping of cassava will increase
   the risk ofR. lignosus-induced rubber tree white root disease, which is
   very hard to prevent and eradicate once rubber trees are infected, the
   intercropping of cassava in rubber plantation rows should not be
   recommended in theR. lignosusprevailing areas.},

Abstract = {Purpose Alley cropping systems introduce herbaceous strips planted with
   trees into cropped fields. While such systems may have a positive effect
   on soil fertility, the respective roles of the trees and the herbaceous
   vegetation in shaping this effect remain unclear. We investigated the
   effect of the distance from herbaceous strips with or without walnut
   trees on soil fertility and earthworm communities in a 20 year old
   Mediterranean plot intercropped with tomatoes. Methods We determined the
   effects of i) the presence of trees, ii) the distance from the
   herbaceous strip (0 m, 1 m and 2.5 m) and iii) the distance from the
   tree on microbial biomass and respiration, earthworm density and soil C,
   N and P contents in the 0-25 cm layer at three sampling seasons. Results
   Herbaceous strips presented a higher microbial biomass C related to soil
   organic carbon, a lower microbial metabolic quotient, and a higher
   density of earthworms than the crop alley regardless of tree presence.
   Soil organic carbon content increased in the presence of trees.
   Available P and microbial biomass increased at 1 m from the tree in the
   HS. Earthworm density and microbial biomass were higher at 1 m than at
   2.5 m from the HS. Conclusions Herbaceous strips were an effective
   shelter for earthworms and fostered a high and efficient microbial
   biomass throughout the year, with or without trees, probably due to
   diversified vegetation and no soil disturbance. The mechanisms by which
   these changes could impact the crop alley remain to be studied.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown that assimilating satellite soil moisture (SM)

   Conservation tillage along with proper crop establishment methods
   (including seed priming, integrated nutrient management) helps in
   sustaining the productivity of crops, especially under rainfed

   laid out in factorial randomized block design with three factors

   independent treatment for general comparison of results. The findings
   showed that chemical and microbial properties of soil were enhanced
   under zero tillage+ mulch as compared to other tillage practices.
   However, crop productivity was higher in conventional tillage+ mulch
   (70.28 q/ha (maize), 35.27 q/ha (wheat)). Under nutrient management
   practices, integrated nutrient management proved to be better as
   compared to recommended dose of fertilizers. Highest production

Abstract = {Overuse of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has led to low N use efficiency (NUE)
   and high N loss in single rice cropping systems in southeast China.
   Application of controlled-release urea (CRU) is considered as an
   effective N fertilizer practice for improving crop yields and NUE. Here,
   field experiments were conducted during 2015-2017 to assess the effects
   of two CRUs (resin-coated urea (RCU) and polyurethane-coated urea (PCU))
   on rice yields, NUE and soil fertility at two sites (Lincheng town (LC)
   and Xintang town (XT)). Four treatments were established at each site:
   (1) control with no N application (CK), (2) split application of
   conventional urea (U, 270kgN ha(-1)), (3) single basal application of
   RCU (RCU, 216kgN ha(-1)), and (4) single basal application of PCU (PCU,
   216kgN ha(-1)). The N application rate in the CRU treatment compared to
   the U treatment was reduced by 20\%. However, the results showed that,
   compared to split application of urea, single basal application of CRU
   led to similar rice grain yields and aboveground biomass at both sites.
   No significant difference in the N uptake by rice plant was observed
   between the U and CRU treatments at either site. There were no
   significant differences in the N apparent recovery efficiency (NARE)
   among the U, RCU and PCU treatments, with the exception of that in XT in
   2015. Compared to application of U, application of CRU increased the N
   agronomic efficiency (NAE) and N partial factor productivity (NPFP) by
   17.4-52.6\% and 23.4-29.8\% at the LC site, and 15.0-84.1\% and
   23.2-33.4\% at the XT site, respectively, during 2015-2017. Yield
   component analysis revealed that greater rice grain yield in response to
   N fertilizer was attributed mainly to the number of panicles per m(2),
   which increased in the fertilized treatments compared to the CK
   treatment. The application of CRU did not affect the soil fertility
   after rice harvest in 2016. Overall, these results suggest that single
   basal application of CRU constitutes a promising alternative N
   management practice for reducing N application rates, time- and
   labor-consuming in rice production in southeast China.},

Abstract = {Sand dune systems in the arid region of north-western China are
   maintained by sand-stabilizing vegetation, which provides critical
   ecosystem services. Limited knowledge of soil moisture recharge in these
   systems hinders sand stabilization efforts. To increase the
   understanding of soil moisture response to rainfall, we analysed soil
   water transport in the desert vadose zone of sand dunes and dune slacks
   following four natural rainfall events during the growing season of
   2017. Rainfall was dominated by small rain events (<5.0 mm), accounting
   for 58\% of total rainfall events. Soil moisture at 5-25 cm depth in
   dune slacks was significantly higher and more variable to 60 cm depth
   than in sand dunes. Soil moisture at 5 cm depth was replenished with
   rainfall amounts of <5 mm in dune slacks, but not in sand dunes. When
   rainfall amount reached 20 mm, soil moisture in dune slack and in sand
   dune increased, but was much higher in dune slack than in sand dune at
   depth of 5 cm; after the rain, soil moisture remained at a relatively
   high level in dune slack but not in sand dune. This was possible because
   dune slacks had higher silt contents and root biomass, which played a
   key role in improving soil water holding capacity or accelerating
   rainfall infiltration at 0-25 cm depth. Overall, the rainfall-driven
   hydrological regime coupled with soil physical factors regulated spatial
   and temporal variability of soil moisture in a sand dune system.},

Title = {Soil Fertility, N<sub>2</sub> Fixation and Yield of Chickpea as
   Influenced by Long-Term Biochar Application under Mung-Chickpea Cropping
   System},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {21},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {A research study was established at the research farm of the University
   of Agriculture, Peshawar during winter 2018-2019. Commercial biochars
   were given to the experimental site from 2014 to summer 2018 and
   received 0.95, 130 and 60 tons ha(-1) of biochar by various treatments
   viz., (Biochar(1)) BC1, (Biochar(2)) BC2, (Biochar(3)) BC3 and
   (Biochar(4)) BC4, respectively. This piece of work was conducted within
   the same study to find the long-term influence of biochar on the
   fertility of the soil, fixation of N-2, as well as the yie1d of chickpea
   under a mung-chickpea cropping system. A split plot arrangement was
   carried out by RCBD (Randomized Complete Block Design) to evaluate the
   study. Twenty-five kilograms of N ha(-1) were given as a starter dosage
   to every plot. Phosphorous and potassium were applied at two levels
   (half (45:30 kg ha(-1)) and full (90:60 kg ha(-1)) recommended doses) to
   each of the four biochar treatments. The chickpea crop parameters
   measured were the numbers and masses of the nodules, N-2 fixation and
   grain yield. Soil parameters recorded were Soil Organic Matter (SOM),
   total N and mineral N. The aforementioned soil parameters were recorded
   after harvesting. The results showed that nodulation in chickpea, grain
   yield and nutrient uptake were significantly enhanced by phosphorous and
   potassium mineral fertilizers. The application of biochar 95 tons ha(-1)
   significantly enhanced number of nodules i-e (122), however
   statistically similar response in terms of nodules number was also noted
   with treatment of 130 tons ha(-1). The results further revealed a
   significant difference in terms of organic matter (OM) (\%) between the
   half and full mineral fertilizer treatments. With the application of 130
   tons ha(-1) of biochar, the OM enhanced from 1.67\% in the control
   treatment, to 2.59\%. However, total and mineral nitrogen were not
   statistically enhanced by the mineral fertilizer treatment. With regard
   to biochar treatments, total and mineral N enhanced when compared with
   the control treatment. The highest total N of 0.082\% and mineral
   nitrogen of 73 mg kg(-1) in the soil were recorded at 130 tons ha(-1) of
   biochar, while the lowest total N (0.049\%) and mineral nitrogen (54 mg
   kg(-1)) in the soil were recorded in the control treatment. The
   collaborative influence of mineral fertilizers and biochars was found to
   be generally non-significant for most of the soil and plant parameters.
   It could be concluded that the aforementioned parameters were greater
   for treatments receiving biochar at 95 tons or more per hectare over the
   last several years, and that the combination of lower doses of mineral
   fertilizers further improved the performance of biochar.},

Abstract = {Current remote sensing techniques fail to observe and generate large
   scale multi-layer soil moisture (SM) the inherent features of the
   satellite sensors. The lack of comprehensive understanding of
   multi-layer SM hinders the sustainable development of agriculture,
   hydrology, and food security. In order to overcome the depth of
   traditional SM assimilation and downscaling methods, we developed a
   Two-step Multi-layer SM Downscaling (TMSMD) framework by fusing
   multi-source remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data through both
   machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning models to generate
   multi-layer SM. The produced multi-layer SM characterized by high
   resolution (1 km), high spatio-temporal continuity (cloud-free and
   daily), and high curacy (i.e., 3H data). Firstly, the coarse resolution
   SMAP SM was downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution LightGBM to weaken the
   effects of scale mismatch issue and provide high-resolution input for
   the subsequent calibration. Results indicated that the downscaled SMAP
   SM remained high consistency with the original SM product. With the
   high-resolution inputs, we calibrated the downscaled SMAP SM using
   multi-layer SM through state-of-the-art attention-based LSTM. Results
   demonstrated that the average PCC, RMSE, ubRMSE, and MAE were improved
   by 22.3 \%, 50.7 \%, 26.2 \%, and 56.7 \% compared to SMAP L4 SM while
   38.5 \%, 52.1 29.5 \%, and 58.7 \% compared to downscaled SMAP SM.
   Further spatio-temporal and comparative analysis confirmed that the
   multi-layer SM produced by the TMSMD framework had excellent performance
   in capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics. In conclude, the
   proposed TMSMD framework successfully generated multi-layer SM data and
   is promising for accurate assessment and monitoring in agriculture,
   water resources, environmental domains.},

Title = {Influence of drip irrigation and straw mulching on economic feasibility

Journal = {IRRIGATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 17},
Abstract = {Water-saving technologies such as drip irrigation and straw mulching are
   aligned with sustainable agriculture as they enhance soil health,
   preserve water resources, and improve crop production. Understanding
   their combined impact, especially in subtropical rice-potato cropping
   system, is crucial. This study delves into the economic feasibility and
   impact on soil fertility when adopting drip irrigation and straw
   mulching. Field experiments demonstrated that using rice straw as mulch
   significantly increased nutrient availability, with available nitrogen
   (N) increasing by 15\% to 17\%, available phosphorus (P) by 13\% to
   14\%, and available potassium (K) by 31\% to 33\% compared to
   non-mulched conditions. Furthermore, compared to conventional
   irrigation, drip irrigation treatments resulted in significantly higher
   soil available N, with increases ranging from 6 to 8\% during the potato
   tuber initiation stage. Economic analysis showed that despite initial
   investment costs, adopting drip irrigation with straw mulch resulted in
   higher net returns. Rice-potato system with drip irrigation and straw
   mulch had a higher benefit-cost ratio, although it had a slighter shift
   in payback period than conventional practice. The research highlights
   sustainable intensification in rice-potato systems, suggesting strategic
   techniques for productivity and resource conservation to farmers and

Abstract = {Organic matter (OM) content and a shallow water table are two key

   soil sampling at five sites along Dalton Highway on Alaska's North
   Slope. These data were used to derive a generalized logistics function
   to characterize the total OM and water saturation fraction behavior

   developed to estimate the soil bulk density and porosity-information
   that is largely missing from existing soil datasets-within each layer,
   solely from the soil texture (organic and mineral properties). Given the
   currently sparse soil database of the Alaskan Arctic, these profile

Abstract = {A sustainable management strategy of soil fertility and cropping system
   is critical to guaranteeing food security. However, little is known
   about the effects of soil amendment strategies on crop growth via
   regulating soil moisture and photosynthesis in a ridge and furrow
   cropping system. Here, field experiments were carried out in 2017 and
   2018 in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China to investigate
   the effects of integrated use of ridge and furrow planting and manure
   amendment on grain yields of maize. Four treatments were designed: CK
   (flat planting with 100\% chemical fertilizer), RFC (ridge and furrow
   planting with 100\% chemical fertilizer), RFR (ridge and furrow planting
   with 100\% control-released fertilizer), and RFM (ridge and furrow
   planting with 50\% manure fertilizer + 50\% N fertilizer). On average,
   RFM increased photosynthetic rates (Pn) by 74\%, followed by RFR by
   47\%, and RFC by 26\%, compared to CK. Also, stomatal conductance (Cd),
   transpiration rates (Tr), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were
   highest with RFM, followed by RFR and RFC. Averaged across the two
   years, RFM conserved 10\% more soil water storage (SWS) than CK did at
   harvest, followed by RFR with an increment by 8\%. However, RFC consumed
   more soil water than CK did, with its ETc 8\% higher than CK.
   Consequently, spring maize treated with RFM suffered less drought
   stress, especially in 2017 when precipitation was insufficient. On
   average, grain yields and water use efficiency of RFM were increased by
   18\% and 27\%, compared to CK. Structural equation modeling analysis
   showed that there existed significant positive correlation between SWS
   in top layers and grain yields, while SWS in deep layers had negative
   effects on grain yields. In conclusion, the incorporation of manure into
   ridge and furrow planting system can be an efficient agronomic practice
   to improve plant photosynthesis, optimize soil moisture, and boost grain
   yields in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China.},

Title = {Plant facilitation shifts along with soil moisture and phosphorus
   gradients via rhizosphere interaction in the maize-grass pea
   intercropping system},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {139},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Plant-plant facilitation is widely studied to increase productivity and
   resource utilization in cereal-legume intercropping system. However,
   physiological and ecological mechanisms driving interspecific
   interaction shift along the environmental gradients is largely unknown.
   To clarify this issue, we first tested plant-plant facilitation along
   with four phosphorus (P) gradients in maize-grass pea intercropping
   system. Results illustrated a progressive transition of seed yield-based
   facilitation from mutually facilitated (+/+) to maize facilitated but
   grass pea as facilitator (+/-) along with low to high P gradients.
   Secondly, above trend was evidently enhanced when combining with drought
   stress gradients, in which severe drought amplified facilitative
   effects, whereas the magnitude of facilitation was relatively weak under
   well-watered condition. Interestingly, biomass-based facilitation
   transition did not synchronize with seed-based one, in which occurred in
   a broader threshold range of water and P gradients. Specifically, total
   yield, biomass, N and P uptake increased by 0.5\%, 4.1\%, 1.8\% and
   2.9\% under the sufficient P and water availability, whereas these
   indicators increased by 25.3\%, 18.5\%, 20.5\% and 21.4\% in P and water
   deficient soils. And the total net effect was positive under all the
   environmental conditions. Rhizosphere interaction plays a crucial role
   in facilitation judgment, and the driving mechanism was associated with
   soil acidification and microbial community promotion under P-deficient
   condition. Under low soil moisture and available P, soil acidification
   and lower rhizosphere soil pH of intercropped maize were observed.
   Rhizosphere phosphatase secretion were significantly activated in
   P-deficient soils and accelerated the mineralization of soil
   organophosphorus, and the microbial biomass P was improved for stronger
   facilitation. Taken together, our findings confirmed the P and water
   driven facilitation shift along with stress gradients and highlighted
   the roles of rhizosphere interaction in affecting species diversity
   advantage. In conclusion, our work provided a relatively full picture
   for plant facilitation evaluation and more accurate management regarding
   intercropping productivity.},

Abstract = {The single-probe heat-pulse (SPHP) technique combined with the
   Fiber-optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology can offer
   novel high-resolution measurements of soil moisture (\& theta;) over
   spatial scales ranging from several centimeters to several kilometers.
   However, the key limitation of this method is in obtaining the
   calibration relationship between \& theta; and soil thermal conductivity
   (\& lambda;) across a specific field. In a previous study, a new
   methodology using a Gaussian processes model was presented to account
   for the spatial variability in the \& lambda;-\& theta; relationship.
   The model aggregated \& theta; measurements from soil moisture sensors
   scattered over the SPHP transect with the corresponding DTS \& lambda;
   measurements at their locations. In this study, a novel methodology is
   tested to optimize the number and locations of soil moisture sensors
   required to account for the spatial variability of the \& lambda;-\&
   theta; relationship to achieve higher accuracy from the SPHP technique.
   The proposed methodology utilizes hierarchical clustering to analyze the
   information contained in the spatial structure of the SPHP measurements
   as the soil dries from a nearly-saturated condition. The proposed
   methodology was tested using data from a field in Oklahoma. Monte-Carlo
   simulation was performed to validate the performance of the proposed
   methodology. The predictions obtained from the proposed methodology

Title = {An innovative method for measuring the hysteresis effects of soil
   moisture on meteorological variables at various time scales and climate
   conditions},
Journal = {GEO-SPATIAL INFORMATION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 1},
Abstract = {Understanding the feedback and reactions of soil moisture to
   meteorological factors in meteorological-hydrological processes is
   essential due to the growing importance of soil moisture in energy and
   water cycles in critical zones. Using soil moisture and meteorological
   data from 1984 to 2018, based on Mann-Kendall and Sen slope trend, two
   possible patterns of land-atmosphere interaction were discovered in the
   Yangtze River Basin (YRB), low soil moisture model with less
   precipitation and higher evapotranspiration, and high-temperature mode
   with less soil moisture and less evapotranspiration. To measure the
   hysteresis between soil moisture and precipitation, temperature, and
   evapotranspiration, a novel method named Three-Step Method was put out.
   The lag times were measured at ground stations spread across various
   climatic zones and timescales. The findings demonstrated that the lag
   times are generally controlled by the regional climate, with shorter lag
   times in drier regions. Both long-term and short-term responses were
   seen in soil moisture to meteorological variables. On a monthly scale,
   soil moisture correlated positively with precipitation but negatively
   with temperature and evapotranspiration. On an annual scale,
   precipitation (temperature, evapotranspiration) lagged by roughly 0 to 2
   months in the upper and middle regions and by -2 to -6 months in the
   lower region of the YRB. The contribution rates of meteorological
   elements on soil moisture were enhanced by taking lag time into account.
   This study provides a unique perspective for better understanding
   climate process forecasts and related drought management by considering
   the hysteresis of soil moisture on the feedback and responses of climate
   variables.},

Title = {A Novel Fusion Method for Generating Surface Soil Moisture Data With
   High Accuracy, High Spatial Resolution, and High Spatio-Temporal
   Continuity},

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) has a considerable impact on land-atmosphere
   exchanges of water and energy fluxes. However, due to the inherent
   deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in
   thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote
   sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and
   seamless field-scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we
   proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution,
   Accurate, Seamless data using Point-Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on
   remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless
   continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and
   albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive
   reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other
   background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30
   m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation
   accuracy, a pixel classification-based bias correction method was
   developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture
   sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson
   correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE
   (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites
   achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, -0.001, and 0.041 m(3)m(-3) respectively.
   After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13\%,
   7\%, 22\%, and 18\%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the
   potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field-scale
   seamless SSM, which is promising for fine-scale studies and applications
   in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.},

Title = {Soil moisture simulation using hybrid artificial intelligent model:
   Hybridization of adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system with grey wolf
   optimizer algorithm},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {575},

Abstract = {Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal
   management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important
   variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the
   global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological,
   ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present
   study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for
   simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy
   inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm
   was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN),
   support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models
   input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay
   content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical
   indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied
   models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance
   Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results
   evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with
   superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values
   for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468\% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated
   the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE
   = 6.427\%, SI = 0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE = 2.137\%, SI =
   0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the
   best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the
   worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model
   improved the simulation accuracy by 48\% and 50\%, respectively,
   compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on
   the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77
   percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO
   model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance
   of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the
   ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the
   explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer
   function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several
   geo-sciences engineering principles.},

Volume = {184},

Abstract = {Understanding the phosphate oxygen isotope (delta O-18-PO4) composition
   of bedrock phosphate sources is becoming ever more important, especially
   in areas of soil research which use this isotope signature as a proxy
   for biological cycling of phosphorus (P). For many of these studies,
   obtaining a sample of the source bedrock or applied mineral fertiliser
   for isotope analysis is impossible; meaning there is now a demand for a
   comprehensive characterisation of global bedrock delta O-18-PO4 to
   support this work. Here we compile delta O-18-PO4 data from a wide range
   of global bedrocks, including 56 new values produced as part of this
   study and a comprehensive overview of those within the previously
   existing literature. We present delta O-18-PO4 data from the range of
   major phosphatic lithologies alongside as much metadata for the samples
   as could be gathered. Much of the data comes from bedrocks of marine
   sedimentary origin (< 1 Ma = > +22 parts per thousand, > 540 Ma =
   approximate to +12 parts per thousand), but we also present data from
   bedrocks associated with guano (range: +19.5 to +15 parts per thousand)
   and igneous deposits (range: +12 to -0.8 parts per thousand), both of
   which have distinct delta O-18-PO4 signatures due to their formation
   mechanisms. We show that where repeat measurements of the same formation
   have been undertaken, regardless of method or exact sample location,
   there is an average within formation error of +/- 1.25 parts per
   thousand. This is important, as is constitutes a reasonable level of
   uncertainty for phosphorus cycling studies which need to estimate
   bedrock delta O-18-PO4 composition based on the literature. In
   combination, this data set presents 284 delta O-18-PO4 values from 56
   countries; a comprehensive starting point for researchers interested in
   understanding bedrock end member delta O-18-PO4.},

   Method},

Abstract = {The soil water content (SWC) is a critical factor in agricultural
   production. To achieve real-time and nondestructive monitoring of the
   SWC, an experiment was conducted to measure the hyperspectral
   reflectance of soil samples with varying levels of water content. The
   soil samples were divided into two parts, SWC higher than field capacity
   (super-\& theta;(f)) and SWC lower than field capacity (sub-\&
   theta;(f)), and the outliers were detected by Monte Carlo
   cross-validation (MCCV). The raw spectra were processed using
   Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing and then the spectral feature variable of
   SWC was extracted by using a combination of competitive adaptive
   reweighted sampling (CARS) and random frog (Rfrog). Based on the
   extracted feature variables, an extreme learning machine (ELM), a
   back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and a support vector
   machine (SVM) were used to establish the prediction model. The results
   showed that the accuracy of retrieving the SWC using the same model was
   poor, under two conditions, i.e., SWC above and below \& theta;(f),
   mainly due to the influence of the lower accuracy of the super-\&
   theta;(f) part. The number of feature variables extracted by the sub-\&
   theta;(f) and super-\& theta;(f) datasets were 25 and 18, respectively,
   accounting for 1.85\% and 1.33\% of the raw spectra, and the variables
   were widely distributed in the NIR range. Among the models, the best
   results were achieved by the BPANN model for both the sub-\& theta;(f)
   and the super-\& theta;(f) datasets; the R(2)p, RMSEp, and RRMSE of the
   sub-\& theta;(f) samples were 0.941, 1.570\%, and 6.685\%, respectively.
   The R(2)p, RMSEp, and RRMSE of the super-\& theta;(f) samples were
   0.764, 1.479\%, and 4.205\%, respectively. This study demonstrates that
   the CARS-Rfrog-BPANN method was reliable for the prediction of SWC.},

   Increasing fertilizer prices and pesticide prices, FAWs (fall armyworms)

   stemborers (44.3\%) were ranked the third and fourth major constraints.
   About 67\% of farmers reported that stemborer damage to maize in PPT
   plots was either minimal or non-existent. Fifty-five percent of farmers
   stated that the damage caused to maize by FAWs was low or that there was
   no damage in PPT plots. PPT reduced stem borer infestation from 83\% to

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM), the average water content of surface soil
   (up to 5 cm depth), plays a key role in the energy exchange within the
   ecosystem. We estimated SSM in areas with vegetation cover (grassland)
   by combining microwave and optical satellite measurements in the central
   Tibetan Plateau (TP) in 2015. We exploited TERRA moderate resolution
   imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Sentinel-1A synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) observations to estimate SSM through a simplified
   water-cloud model (sWCM). This model considers the impact of vegetation
   water content (VWC) to SSM retrieval by integrating the vegetation index
   (VI), the normalized difference water index (NDWI), or the normalized
   difference infrared index (NDII). Sentinel-1 SAR C-band backscattering
   coefficients, incidence angle, and NDWI/NDII were assimilated in the
   sWCM to monitor SSM. The soil moisture and temperature monitoring
   network on the central TP (CTP-SMTMN) measures SSM within the study
   area, and ground measurements were applied to train and validate the
   model. Via the proposed methods, we estimated the SSM in vegetated area
   with an R-2 of 0.43 and a ubRMSE of 0.06 m(3)/m(3) when integrating the

Abstract = {Concerns exist about the viability of food security across Europe due to
   multiple, potentially adverse drivers. These include economic, political
   and climate forcing factors, all of which require quantification. Here,
   we focus on the climate forcing, and in particular, the soil moisture
   change component which crucially determines water availability for crop
   uptake. We estimate future soil moisture levels at 34 sites of the UK
   COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS-UK) network. We do
   this by combining three platforms: the Joint UK Land Environment
   Simulator (JULES) land surface model, field-scale soil moisture
   observations from the COSMOS-UK stations and 2.2 km
   convection-permitting UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). We use COSMOS-UK
   data to optimise key soil moisture-related parameters in the JULES
   model, based on its performance in the contemporary period. We then
   force the calibrated model with UKCP18 data to produce future soil
   moisture estimates. We evaluate the modelled soil moisture for an
   average soil depth between 0 and 35 cm to match the depth of soil
   moisture observations. Our main conclusions concern future soil moisture
   droughts which we compare with equivalent events in the historical
   period, 1982-2000. We find that on average across all sites, there is an
   increase in the frequency of future extreme soil moisture drought events
   of duration above 90 days. In 2062-80, such frequency increase of
   between 0.1 and 0.6 events per year (equivalent to at least 2 and up to
   12 additional events in a 20-year period) is expected. We also show
   that, in 2062-80, there is an increased risk of high or more intense
   soil moisture drought conditions in months between May and November,
   with months between June and October being at especially high risk. The
   UKCP18 data corresponds to a high-emissions future described by the
   RCP8.5 scenario.},

   film mulch) and two slope treatments (5 degrees slope and 10 degrees
   slope) of sloping farmlands were studied at the Nationally Agricultural
   Environment Fuxin Observation and Experiment Station in China through a
   micro-zone simulation and a long-term positioning experiment. The
   results indicated that ridge film mulch and furrow seeding significantly
   improve the water use efficiency and partial factor productivity of the
   plants in sloping farmlands, with the highest increases being 51.33\%
   and 45.05\%. By analyzing the coordinated relationship between water,
   nutrients, and roots, it was found that ridge film furrow seeding
   technology can significantly affect the spatial distribution of water,
   nutrients, and roots in different soil layers, and improves the
   effective coefficient of soil water and nutrients. The effective
   coefficient of ridge film and straw treatment was 2.53, while the
   average value of the effective coefficient of ridge film treatment was
   1.39. Further analysis found that the degree of consistency between the
   root system, water, and nutrient barycenter was highly correlated with
   the effective coefficients of water and nutrients. Visual radar map
   analysis revealed that root development limits the improvement
   availability of the efficient use of water and nutrients in the soil.
   Promoting root development indicators and root spatial distribution
   through ridge film coverage was an effective way to improve the
   efficient use of maize water and nutrients. The ridge film mulching
   promoted the root development index and root spatial distribution, thus
   improving the efficient use of water and nutrients in maize. Overall,
   the ranking of the regulation effect was as follows: ridge film and
   straw mulch > ridge film mulch > no mulch, and 5 degrees slope > 10
   degrees slope. This research provided a theoretical basis for the
   enhancement of use efficiency in water and nutrients in sloping
   farmlands.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an effective method to
   measure soil moisture at a horizontal scale of hundreds of metres and a
   depth of decimetres. Recent studies proposed operating CRNS in a network
   with overlapping footprints in order to cover root-zone water dynamics
   at the small catchment scale and, at the same time, to represent spatial
   heterogeneity. In a joint field campaign from September to November 2020
   (JFC-2020), five German research institutions deployed 15 CRNS sensors
   in the 0.4 km(2) Wustebach catchment (Eifel mountains, Germany). The
   catchment is dominantly forested (but includes a substantial fraction of
   open vegetation) and features a topographically distinct catchment
   boundary. In addition to the dense CRNS coverage, the campaign featured
   a unique combination of additional instruments and techniques:
   hydro-gravimetry (to detect water storage dynamics also below the root
   zone); ground-based and, for the first time, airborne CRNS roving; an
   extensive wireless soil sensor network, supplemented by manual
   measurements; and six weighable lysimeters. Together with comprehensive
   data from the long-term local research infrastructure, the published
   data set (available at
   https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.756ca0485800474e9dc7f5949c63b872;
   Heistermann et al., 2022) will be a valuable asset in various research
   contexts: to advance the retrieval of landscape water storage from CRNS,
   wireless soil sensor networks, or hydrogravimetry; to identify
   scale-specific combinations of sensors and methods to represent soil
   moisture variability; to improve the understanding and simulation of
   land-atmosphere exchange as well as hydrological and hydrogeological
   processes at the hillslope and the catchment scale; and to support the
   retrieval of soil water content from airborne and spaceborne remote
   sensing platforms.},

Abstract = {Understanding soil moisture dynamics at the sub-kilometre scale is
   increasingly important, especially with the continuous development of
   hyper-resolution land surface and hydrological models. Cosmic-ray
   neutron sensors (CRNSs) are able to provide estimates of soil moisture
   at this elusive scale, and networks of these sensors have been expanding
   across the world over the previous decade. However, each network
   currently implements its own protocol when processing raw data into soil
   moisture estimates. As a consequence, this lack of a harmonised global
   data set can ultimately lead to limitations in the global assessment of
   the CRNS technology from multiple networks. Here, we present crspy, an
   open-source Python tool that is designed to facilitate the processing of
   raw CRNS data into soil moisture estimates in an easy and harmonised
   way. We outline the basic structure of this tool, discussing the
   correction methods used as well as the metadata that crspy can create
   about each site. Metadata can add value to global-scale studies of
   field-scale soil moisture estimates by providing additional routes to
   understanding catchment similarities and differences. We demonstrate
   that current differences in processing methodologies can lead to
   misinterpretations when comparing sites from different networks and that
   having a tool to provide a harmonised data set can help to mitigate
   these issues. By being open source, crspy can also serve as a
   development and testing tool for new understanding of the CRNS
   technology as well as being used as a teaching tool for the community.},

Title = {Effects of Seasonal Freezing and Thawing on Soil Moisture and Salinity
   in the Farmland Shelterbelt System in the Hetao Irrigation District},

Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Water resources are scarce, and secondary soil salinization is severe in
   the Hetao Irrigation District. Farmland shelterbelt systems (FSS) play a
   critical role in regulating soil water and salt dynamics within the
   irrigation district. However, the understanding of soil water and salt
   migration within FSS during the freeze-thaw period remains unclear due
   to the complex and multifaceted interactions between water and salt.
   This study focused on a typical FSS and conducted comprehensive
   monitoring of soil moisture, salinity, temperature, and meteorological
   parameters during the freeze-thaw period. The results revealed
   consistent trends in air temperature and soil temperature overall. Soil
   freezing durations exceeded thawing durations, and both decreased with
   an increasing soil depth. At the three critical freeze-thaw nodes, the
   soil moisture content at a 0-20 cm depth was significantly lower than at
   a 40-100 cm depth (p < 0.05). The soil water content increased with time
   and depth at varying distances from the shelterbelt, with an average
   increase of 7.63\% after freezing and thawing. The surface water content
   at the forest edge (0.3H, 4H) was lower than inside the farmland (1H,
   2H, 3H). Soil salt accumulation occurred during both freezing stable
   periods and melting-thawing periods in the 0-100 cm soil layer near the
   forest edge (0.3H, 4H), with the highest soil salinity reaching 0.62
   g<middle dot>kg(-1). After the freeze-thaw period, the soil salt content
   in each layer increased by 11.41-47.26\% compared to before the
   freeze-thaw period. Salt accumulation in farmland soil near the
   shelterbelt was stronger than in the far shelterbelt. The multivariate
   statistical model demonstrated goodness of fit for soil water and salt
   as 0.94 and 0.72, respectively, while the BP neural network model showed
   goodness of fit for soil water and salt as 0.82 and 0.85, respectively.
   Our results provide an efficient theoretical basis for FSS construction
   and agricultural water management practices.},

Title = {Partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer improves soil
   fertility and crop yields while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize
   rotation system},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},

Abstract = {Excessive synthetic N fertilization has resulted in severe soil
   degradation and high greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems. As a
   promising approach for achieving sustainable agriculture, partial
   organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer can affect the
   stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N, thereby
   regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, the responses of soil
   N2O emissions and crop productivity to different ratios of organic
   fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF) are still unclear, making
   the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. A 2-year field
   experiment was conducted to measure soil properties, N2O emissions, and
   crop yields in a wheat-maize rotation system. Six fertilization
   managements were included: no fertilization (CK); total SF; and 15\%,
   30\%, 45\%, and 100\% of organic substitution for synthetic fertilizers
   (LO, MO, HO, and OF), respectively. Compared to SF, soil annual
   cumulative N2O emissions in LO, MO, HO, and OF were significantly
   reduced by 16.2-20.5\%, 28.9-33.9\%, 33.2-42.2\%, and 70.2-74.9\% in two
   years, respectively. The mitigation of N2O emission with organic
   substitution was mainly attributed to the decreasing NO3 - and NH4+
   contents and increasing soil pH. Meanwhile, soil organic C and total N
   were considerably higher in HO and OF than other treatments, with the
   lowest in CK in wheat season and in SF in maize season. Synthetic
   fertilizer and partial organic substitution increased the annual yield
   of wheat and maize compared with OF and CK in the first year, and HO
   increased the annual yield by 9.7\% and 37.6\% compared with SF and OF
   in the second year, respectively. The beneficial yield effects were
   mainly due to the enhanced synchronization of nutrient availability and
   soil fertility with partial organic substitution. Finally, the
   yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced with increasing ratios of
   organic substitution in two years. Our study suggested that partial
   organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer, especially 45\% organic
   substitution would be feasible fertilization strategy to improve soil
   fertility and crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions in
   wheat-maize rotation systems.},

   Study of the Continental US},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays an important role for understanding Earth's
   land and near-surface atmosphere interactions. Existing studies rarely
   considered using multi-source data and their sensitiveness to SM
   retrieval with few in-situ measurements. To solve this issue, we
   designed a SM retrieval method (Multi-MDA-RF) using random forest (RF)
   based on 29 features derived from passive microwave remote sensing data,
   optical remote sensing data, land surface models (LSMs), and other
   auxiliary data. To evaluate the importance of different features to SM
   retrieval, we first compared 10 filter or embedded type feature
   selection methods with sequential forward selection (SFS). Then, RF was
   employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between the in-situ SM
   measurements from sparse network stations and the optimal feature
   subset. The experiments were conducted in the continental U.S. (CONUS)
   using in-situ measurements during August 2015, with only 5225 training
   samples covering the selected feature subset. The experimental results
   show that mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is better than other feature
   selection methods, and Multi-MDA-RF outperforms the back-propagation
   neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN),
   with the R and unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values being
   0.93 and 0.032 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. In comparison with other SM
   products, Multi-MDA-RF is more accurate and can well capture the SM
   spatial dynamics.},

Abstract = {Accurate initial soil moisture conditions are essential for numerical
   weather prediction models, because they play a major role in
   land-atmosphere interactions. This study constructed a soil moisture
   data assimilation system and evaluated its impacts on the Global Data
   Assimilation and Prediction System based on the Korea Integrated Model
   (GDAPS-KIM) to improve its weather forecast skill. Soil moisture data
   retrieved from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard the
   Meteorological Operational Satellite was assimilated into GDAPS-KIM
   using the ensemble Kalman filter method, and its impacts were evaluated
   for the 2019 boreal summer period. Our results indicated that the soil
   moisture data assimilation improved the agreement of the observations
   with the initial conditions of GDAPS-KIM. This led to a statistically
   significant improvement in the accuracy of the initial fields. A
   comparison of a five-day forecast against an ERA5 reanalysis and in situ
   observations revealed a reduction in the dry and warm biases of
   GDAPS-KIM over the surface and in the lower- and mid-level atmospheres.
   The temperature bias correction through the initialization of the soil
   moisture estimates from the data assimilation system was shown in the
   five-day weather forecast (root mean squared errors reduction of the
   temperature at 850 hPa by approximately 5\% in East Asia).},

Abstract = {The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) algorithm that can model larger-scale
   spatial heterogeneity and integrate multiple types of data is a better
   spatial estimation algorithm in avoiding the circular problem and
   improving the estimation accuracy of parameters than original empirical
   geostatistic and spatial statistic methods. To obtain higher-resolution
   and higher-accuracy soil moisture (SM) data, this study used the BME
   algorithm to integrate the multiple environmental factor variables
   related to SM as auxiliary data (11 data sets in total) such as the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature
   (LST), and Albedo products with 1 kilometre (km) grid resolution from
   the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Advanced
   Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital
   Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) satellite data, and the Slope, Aspect, Plan
   curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, Relief
   amplitude products generated from ASTER GDEM data. First, the FengYun
   3-B satellite (FY3-B) SM product with 25 km grid resolution was
   downscaled to 1 km grid resolution using the visible, infrared (IR), and
   microwave fusion method. The downscaled FY3-B SM data and auxiliary data
   were used to generate the weighted probability soft data (SD) under four
   cases, case 1: 500 sample points of SD, case 2: 450 sample points of SD,
   case 3: 400 sample points of SD, and case 4: 350 sample points of SD.
   Particularly, we used two methods, the multivariable correlation
   analysis method and principal component analysis (PCA) method to get the
   weight values of environmental factor variables, i.e. NDVI, LST, Albedo,
   the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature,
   Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, and Relief
   amplitude with SM. Then, thein-situSM measurements as hard data (HD)
   were used to calibrate the weighted probability SD in the procedure of
   BME SM estimation. The SM under four cases were estimated from the
   weighted probability SD and HD using BME algorithm. Finally, comparisons
   of the estimated SM using BME algorithm within-situSM measurements at
   maize study area were carried out in this study. Our results indicated
   that the accuracy of the estimated SM using BME algorithm, the
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.049 cm(3) cm(-3), the correlation
   coefficient (r) = 0.639, the unbiased RMSE (RMSEu) = 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3),
   and Bias = 0.002 cm(3) cm(-3), under case 1 based on PCA method was
   obviously better than the downscaled FY3-B SM (RMSE = 0.079 cm(3)
   cm(-3),r= 0.096, RMSEu = 0.069 cm(3)cm(-3), and Bias = 0.039
   cm(3)cm(-3)) that was generated by the visible, IR, and microwave fusion
   method. We concluded that integrating auxiliary data into SM estimation
   using BME algorithm could further improve the downscaled FY3-B SM that
   was generated by visible, IR, and microwave fusion method.},

   Moisture Conservation Practices in the Leeward Kohala Field System,
   Hawai'i Island},

Abstract = {Intensive cultivation of `uala (sweet potato) in the Leeward Kohala
   field system on Hawai'i Island supported substantial populations of
   Native Hawaiians prior to its abandonment in the 19th century.
   Productivity is influenced by the heterogeneity of the climate and
   biogeochemical soil characteristics across the substantial ecological
   gradient. Agricultural infrastructure and associated practices were
   developed to manage crop production eventuating from the variation in
   inter- and intra-annual rainfall. Mechanisms of sustaining soil nitrogen
   (N) are still unclear; however, a pronounced source of N is soil organic
   matter decomposition. This study investigated in situ the effects of
   indigenous Hawaiian mulching practices against two control treatments on
   soil moisture and temperature dynamics to facilitate N mineralization in
   soil mounds cultivated with `uala. Field experiments were set in two
   agricultural restoration plots with distinct climatic and soil
   characteristics. Data included soil moisture and temperature, soil and
   plant N, growth and development of `uala, and real-time weather data.
   Concurrently, N mineralization was also investigated under controlled
   conditions. All indigenous mulching treatments were found to
   significantly increase soil moisture, regulate temperature variation,
   and improve N availability compared to control. Differences in soil
   properties between treatments translated to significant differences in
   above-ground biomass. The data suggest that these differences would
   extend to tuber production, but the use of a long-gestation variety
   limited tuber production in the study. Increased temperatures in the
   controlled experiments were observed to increase inorganic N
   significantly, but less substantially than soil moisture. Indigenous
   practices in the region could have greatly mitigated plant stress due to
   moisture, temperature, and N availability, increasing productivity and
   reducing the variability of the Leeward Kohala Field System.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the land use and land cover (LULC), land
   surface temperature (LST), soil moisture (SM), and evapotranspiration
   (ET) in the Kutopalong Rohingya refugee camp of the Cox's Bazar District
   in Bangladesh and compare the results to their surrounding areas to
   determine the changes for the duration of 2014-2019. A mix of indices
   and spatial algorithm-based remote sensing methodologies were applied on
   Landsat 8 satellite images to extract information on the mentioned
   surface components and processes. The empirical study suggests that
   since 2017 land use has become progressively diverse in pattern. A
   decrease of 6.16\% in vegetation cover, respectively, with increased
   grassland and built-up by 5.13\% and 1.79\% for the whole of Cox's
   Bazar, has been observed during the 5 years. The significant changes are
   evident in the Kutupalong campsite alone, experiencing an 80.32\%
   decrease in its total forest lands resulting from more than a four-time
   increase in Rohingya settlements within 2 years. With an overall
   accuracy of 87\%, the findings are consistent with global LULC change
   patterns. Statistical and correlation analyses were used to explore the
   LST, SM, and ET. The results illustrate that the highly populated areas
   are associated with the highest LST and lowest ET, and vice versa. The
   maximum temperature observed is during the peak refugee intrusion period
   of 2017, ranging between 20.29-35.89 degrees C and 20.87-34.96 degrees
   C, respectively, for January and December. SM content was estimated for
   bare lands, and the obtained information indicates that dense human
   settlement directly and negatively impacts this variable. As a result,
   land in the entire Rohingya campsite is subject to a shift from moderate
   to mostly dry soil conditions. Evapotranspiration showed a linear trend
   with SM change and has decreased over the period.},

Title = {Spatial-temporal coupling pattern between irrigation demand and soil
   moisture dynamics throughout wheat-maize rotation system in the North
   China Plain},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {151},

Abstract = {Irrigation water requirement (Iwr) and soil moisture (SM) are two
   essential metrics that guide scientific irrigation and agricultural
   water-saving practices. Although they have been extensively studied in
   the North China Plain (NCP), an exploration into their spatial-temporal
   coupling pattern remains absent. Here, the spatial-temporal coupling
   pattern underlying the variations of Iwr and SM across the winter
   wheat-summer maize rotation system within the NCP was elucidated from a
   geographic perspective, by developing a geo-statistic framework that
   integrated the global spatial autocorrelation, spatial hot-spot
   technique, geographically weighted regression, and the optimal
   parameters-based geographic detector. From 2000-2019, the Iwr and SM
   exerted a distinct geo-spatial heterogeneity. Winter wheat demonstrated
   a spatially descending gradient in Iwr from north to south, while the
   pattern in summer maize Iwr varied greatly across periods. Generally,
   winter wheat had a higher Iwr, while the geospatial pattern of summer
   maize Iwr displayed a greater variability. Spatial pattern of SM in
   0-100 cm soil horizon exhibited an approximately inverse trajectory to
   that of Iwr, while SM in 100-200 cm horizon demonstrated a spatial
   staggered pattern. In most cases, there existed a notable negative
   coupling between Iwr and SM at 0-100 cm depth, but not universal at
   100-200 cm. Nonetheless, a pronounced reciprocal enhancement mechanism
   between SM of two layers was confirmed. Between 2000 and 2019, a
   geospatial decoupling trend was detected between Iwr and SM throughout
   the NCP. Despite remaining universality, the pattern of high irrigation
   demand induced by soil moisture deficit was being weakened. Given these,
   climate-adaptive water-saving strategies were updated, which provide a
   new implication for regional agricultural water-saving practice and
   sustainable production.},

   intensity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons based on near-infrared
   diffuse reflection spectroscopy},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Soil moisture has a strong impact on the fluorescence intensity of PAHs,
   which is undoubtedly posing a challenge for the development of rapid
   real-time fluorescence detection technology of PAHs in soil. In this
   work, NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to correct the
   fluorescence spectra of PAHs in order to reduce the effect of the soil
   moisture. To establish the correction method, eight soil samples with
   different moisture contents and a given phenanthrene concentration (8
   mg/g) were prepared. The fluorescence and NIR diffuse reflectance
   spectra were collected for of all samples. It was found that the
   fluorescence spectra of the soil samples that vary with the moisture
   content together with the NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were
   considered for the correction of the fluorescence intensity of
   phenanthrene related to the moisture content. The results showed that
   the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at 384 nm to the NIR diffuse
   reflectance spectrum absorbance at 5184 cm(-1) can be used as a
   correction factor to reduce the effect of the soil moisture on the
   fluorescence intensity of phenanthrene in the soil. The validity of the
   correction method was verified by the quantitative analysis of PAHs with
   different concentrations and soil moisture contents. The results showed
   better linearity between the fluorescence intensity and the
   concentration of PAHs after the correction (with a correlation
   coefficient R of 0.99) than before the correction (with R of 0.86). The
   relative prediction errors for three unknown samples decreased from
   19\%, 51\% and 40\% before the correction to 5\%, 13\% and 0.44\% after
   the correction, respectively, indicating the feasibility of the
   detection of PAHs in the soil by the combination of fluorescence and NIR
   diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {Improving the ESA CCI Daily Soil Moisture Time Series with Physically

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Models have historically been the source of global soil moisture (SM)
   analyses and estimates of land-atmosphere coupling, even though they are
   usually calibrated and validated only locally. Satellite-based analyses
   have grown in fidelity and duration, offering an independent
   observationally based alternative. However, satellite-retrieved SM time
   series include random and periodic errors that degrade estimates of
   land-atmosphere coupling, including correlations with other variables.
   This study proposes a mathematical approach to adjust daily time series
   of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI)
   satellite SM product using information from physically based land
   surface model (LSM) datasets using a Fourier transform time-filtering
   method to match the temporal power spectra locally to the LSMs, which
   tend to agree well with in situ observations. When the original and
   timely adjusted SM products are evaluated against ground-based SM
   measurements over the conterminous United States, Europe, and Australia,
   results show the adjusted SM has significantly improved subseasonal
   variability. The skill of the adjusted SM is increased in temporal
   correlation by similar to 0.05 over all analysis domains without
   introducing spurious regional patterns, affirming the stochastic nature
   of noise in satellite estimates, and skill improvement is found for
   nearly all land cover classes, especially savannas and grassland.
   Autocorrelation-based soil moisture memory (SMM) and the derived random
   component of soil moisture error (SME) are used to investigate the
   improvement of SM features. The time filtering reduces the random noise
   from the satellite-based SM product that is not explainable by
   physically based SM dynamics; SME is usually diminished and the
   increased SMM is generally statistically significant.},

Abstract = {Determining how soil-crop management practices affect phosphorus

   of P fertilization on different soil P fractions. This study evaluated
   changes in soil P fractions as affected by long-term P fertilization
   under conventional tillage. Different P level applied soil samples were
   sequentially extracted to separate P into distilled deionized
   water-extractable, 2 M KCl solution-extractable, 0.1 M NaOH-extractable,
   4. 0.1 M HCl-extractable, 0.5 M NaOH-extractable, and HCl: HNO3 mixture
   (2:5) fractions. Changes of all soil P fractions were indicating the
   occurrence of soil P transformation and movement over the time. The
   resin-extractable P, H2O-extractable and NaOH-extractable P were
   significantly increased under long-term P fertilization. The highest P
   applied soil had the highest total phosphorus (PT) contents. Also the
   percent distribution of Ca and Mg-bound P CaMgP, humic HaP and fulvic
   acid, and FaP increased with P fertilizer level increases. The other
   extraction P level did not increase vary consistently with increasing
   levels of P fertilization. Also soil P lability except soluble reactive
   phosphorus (SRP), KCl extractable phosphorus (EP), and particulate
   organic phosphorus (POP) increased consistently by P fertilization.
   Increasing P fertilization significantly (p < .001) increased the
   phosphorus management index (PMI) of extracted P fractions except for
   EP. The work demonstrated that P under long-term corn-wheat treated
   soils changed as a result of changes in labile P fractions probably due
   to the solubilization of residual fertilizer P joined with corn/wheat
   crop rotation factors. The highest P applied soil had the highest total

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Evaluating the interactions between above- and below-ground processes is
   important to understand and quantify how ecosystems respond differently
   to atmospheric forcings and/or perturbations and how this depends on
   their intrinsic characteristics and heterogeneity. Improving such
   understanding is particularly needed in snow-impacted mountainous
   systems where the complexity in water and carbon storage and release
   arises from strong heterogeneity in meteorological forcing and terrain,
   vegetation and soil characteristics. This study investigates spatial and
   temporal interactions between terrain, soil moisture, and plant seasonal
   dynamics at the intra- and inter-annual scale along a 160 m long
   mountainous, non-forested hillslope-to-floodplain system in the upper
   East River Watershed in the upper Colorado River Basin. To this end,
   repeated UAV-based multi-spectral aerial imaging, ground-based soil
   electrical resistivity imaging, and soil moisture sensors were used to
   quantify the interactions between above and below-ground compartments.
   Results reveal significant soil-plant co-dynamics. The spatial variation
   and dynamics of soil water content and electrical conductivity, driven
   by topographic and soil intrinsic characteristics, correspond to
   distinct plant types, with highest plant productivity in convergent
   areas. Plant productivity in heavy snow years benefited from more water
   infiltration as well as a shallow groundwater table depth. In
   comparison, low snowpack years with an early first bare-ground date,
   which are linked to an early increase in plant greenness, imply a short
   period of saturated conditions that leads to lower average and maximum
   greenness values during the growing season. Overall, these results
   emphasize the strong impact of snowpack dynamics, and terrain and
   subsurface characteristics on the heterogeneity in plant type and
   seasonal dynamics.},

Abstract = {Straw returning and livestock manure reuse are effective nature-based
   solutions (NBS) for nutrient cycling and sustainable crop production.
   However, it remains unclear how these agricultural practices affect
   phosphorus (P) transformation, movement, and the risk of loss in
   long-term crop production. The present study assessed the 30-year
   effects of the following five fertilizer treatments on rice yield, P
   transformation, movement, and loss in the soil profile: control (no
   fertilizer), NPK (chemical fertilizer), NPK + S (NPK with straw
   returning), NPK + M (NPK with manure), and NPK1.5 + S (1.5-folds NPK
   with straw returning). Compared with the NPK treatment, the NPK + S, NPK
   + M, and NPK1.5 + S treatments demonstrated no further increase in rice
   grain yield but significantly increased the seasonal soil P surplus by
   3.3, 6.0, and 16.8 kg P ha-1, respectively. Compared with NPK, the soil
   Olsen-P concentration in the 0-0.2 m soil layer increased by 24.5 and
   89.7\% respectively for NPK + S and NPK1.5 + S. The environmental soil P
   threshold for the rice-wheat rotation system in Purpli-Udic Cambisol is
   49.9 mg kg-1. The straw returning treatment (NPK + S and NPK1.5 + S)
   continually maintained a higher P index (9.5-13.5) in the 0-0.3 m soil
   layers. These results suggested that an integrative P strategy should be
   provided to manage soil P surplus and P environmental loss risk in the
   chemical combined with organic fertilizers of rice-wheat rotation,
   ensuring sustainable food security and achieving NBS goals.},

Abstract = {Forage grasses used in cropping no-till systems in tropical regions
   alter soil chemical properties, but their longterm impact on soil
   microbial processes of the nitrogen (N) cycle and microbial community
   abundance, composition and structure are unknown. Here, microbial
   functions related to nitrogen fixation, nitrification and
   denitrification as well as bacterial, archaeal and fungal populations
   were evaluated in a long-term field experiment in which tropical forage
   grasses palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R.D.
   Webster) and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis (R. Germ. and C.M. Evrard) Crins)
   were cultivated with or without N fertilization. Uncultivated soil was
   used as a control. Forage grasses, especially palisade grass, increased
   soil bacterial and fungal abundances, whereas the archaeal population
   was highest in uncultivated soil. In soils cultivated with forage
   grasses, N fertilization favored N-cycle-related genes; however,
   cultivation of palisade grass increased the abundances of amoA bacteria
   (AOB) and amoA archaea (AOA) genes associated with soil nitrification
   and decreased the abundances of genes nirS, nirK and nosZ genes related
   to denitrification, compared to ruzigrass and control, regardless of N
   input. In addition, abundances of total bacteria and total fungi were
   associated with the N cycle and plant biomass in soils cultivated with
   forage grasses. Forage cultivation clearly benefitted the soil nutrient
   environment (S-SO42-, Mg2+, total-C and -N, N-NO3- and N-NH4+) and
   microbiome (bacteria and fungi) compared with uncultivated soil. In soil
   cultivated with palisade grass, the microbial community composition was
   unresponsive to N addition. The high N uptake by palisade grass supports
   the competitive advantage of this plant species over microorganisms for
   N sources. Our results suggest that palisade grass has advantages over
   ruzigrass for use in agriculture systems, regardless of N input.},

Abstract = {A method of soil moisture and organic matter content detection based on
   hyperspectral technology is proposed. A total of 800 different soil
   samples and hyperspectral data were collected in the laboratory and from
   the field. A hyperspectral database was established. After wavelet
   denoising and principal component analysis (PCA) preprocessing, the
   convolutional neural network (CNN) module was first used to extract the
   wavelength features of the data. Then, the long- and short-memory neural
   network (LSTM) module was used to extract the feature bands and nearby
   hidden state vectors. At the same time, the genetic algorithm (GA) was
   used to optimize the hyperparametric weight and bias value of the LSTM
   training network. At the initial stage, the data were normalized, and
   all features were analyzed by grey correlation degree to extract
   important features and to reduce the computational complexity of the
   data. Then, the GA-optimized CNN-LSTM hybrid neural network
   (GA-CNN-LSTM) algorithm model proposed in this paper was used to predict
   soil moisture and organic matter. The prediction performance was
   compared with CNN, support vector regression (SVR), and CNN-LSTM hybrid
   neural network model without GA optimization. The GA-CNN-LSTM algorithm
   was superior to other models in all indicators. The highest accuracy
   rates of 94.5\% and 92.9\% were obtained for soil moisture and organic
   matter, respectively. This method can be applied to portable
   hyperspectrometers and unmanned aerial vehicles to realize large-scale
   monitoring of moisture and organic matter distribution and to provide a
   basis for rational irrigation and fertilization in the future.},

Abstract = {In arid and semi-arid sub-tropical regions of India, pearl millet
   {[}Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping
   system is the most important system under irrigated conditions. However,
   it is very exhaustive cropping system and productivity of pearl
   millet-wheat system has become constant or marginally declined for the
   last three decades. The imbalanced use of fertilizers and high intensity
   farming activities declined the soil nutrient status and also
   deteriorate physical and biological properties of soil. Therefore, to
   maintain soil health and productivity, balanced fertilization based on
   soil testing is very essential. A study of balanced fertilization based
   on Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) approach was initiated in 2009 at
   Research Farm, CCSHAU, Hisar, with seven treatments viz. T-1-control,
   T-2-farm yard manure (FYM) @ 15 t ha(-1), T-3-recommended dose of
   nitrogen and phosphorus (RDN and P), T-4-STCR with target yield (TY) 3.0
   t ha(-1), T-5-STCR with TY 3.5 t ha(-1), T-6-integrated STCR with TY 3.0
   t ha(-1) + FYM and T-7-integrated STCR with TY 3.5 t ha(-1) + FYM.
   Integrated treatment (T-7) recorded the highest crop grain and straw
   yield followed by chemical fertilizers alone (T-3-T-5) whereas lowest
   grain and straw yield was found in control (T-1) after 10 cycles of
   pearl millet-wheat system. Application of FYM along with chemical
   fertilizers enhanced total N, P and K uptake by approximately 150, 192
   and 150\% respectively, over the control. However, soil organic carbon
   (SOC) and available nutrients were found maximum at early developmental
   stages and decreased at maturity. The long-term balanced nutrient
   management using STCR approach has improved soil nutrient status, SOC,
   pearl millet yield, nutrient uptake and use efficiency of fertilizers.},

Abstract = {An accurate assessment of soil water balance components (SWBCs) is
   necessary for improving irrigation strategies in any water-limited
   environment. However, quantitative information on SWBCs is usually
   challenging to obtain, because none of the components (i.e., irrigation,
   drainage, and evapotranspiration) can be easily measured under actual
   conditions. Soil moisture is a variable that integrates the water
   balance components of land surface hydrology, and the evolution of soil
   moisture is assumed to contain the memory of antecedent hydrologic
   fluxes, and can thus be used to determine SWBCs from a hydrologic
   balance. A database of soil moisture measurements from six experimental
   plots with different treatments in the middle Heihe River basin of China
   was used to test the potential of a such a database for estimating
   SWBCs. We first compared the hydrophysical properties of the soils in
   these plots, such as vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and
   soil water retention features, for supporting SWBC estimations. We then
   determined evapotranspiration and other SWBCs using a method that
   combined the soil water balance method and the inverse Richards equation
   (a model of unsaturated soil water flow based on the Richards equation).
   To test the accuracy of our estimation, we used both indirect methods
   (such as power consumption of the pumping irrigation well and published
   SWBCs values at nearby sites) and the water balance equation technique
   to verify the estimated SWBCs values, all of which showed good
   reliability with respect to our estimation method. Finally, the
   uncertainties of the proposed methods were analyzed to evaluate the
   systematic error of the SWBC estimation and any restrictions regarding
   its application. The results showed significant variances among the
   film-mulched plots in both the cumulative irrigation volumes
   (652.1-867.3 mm) and deep drainages (170.7-364.7 mm). Moreover, the
   un-mulched plot had remarkably higher values in both cumulative
   irrigation volumes (1186.5 mm) and deep drainages (651.8 mm) compared
   with the mulched plots. Obvious correlation existed between the volume
   of irrigation and that of drained water. However, the ET demands for all
   of the plots behaved pretty much the same, with the cumulative ET values
   ranging between 489.1 and 561.9 mm for the different treatments in 2016,
   suggesting that the superfluous irrigation amounts had limited influence
   on the accumulated ET throughout the growing season due to the poor
   water-holding capacity of the sandy soil. This work confirmed that
   relatively reasonable estimations of the SWBCs in coarse-textured sandy
   soils can be derived by using soil moisture measurements; the proposed
   methods provided a reliable solution over the entire growing season and
   showed a great potential for identifying appropriate irrigation amounts
   and frequencies, and thus a move toward sustainable water resources
   management, even under traditional surface irrigation conditions.},

Abstract = {Cassava is an important source of food security and livelihoods for
   millions of consumers daily. Water deficit conditions are one of the
   major factors that affect the development of root system architecture
   (RSA) and consequently, crop productivity, and yet, due to its long
   maturity periods and bulky storage root systems, RSA studies in cassava
   are uncommon. The objective of this study was to identify traits that
   are responsible for the variability and plastic responses of cassava in
   response to drought at the juvenile stage of growth. Eight cassava
   genotypes were grown in soil-filled pots under well-watered and
   droughted conditions for up to 45 days and multivariate analyses
   employed to determine the major contributory traits to variability and
   the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) was computed to evaluate
   plasticity. There were significant genotypic variations for most of the
   traits measured. Drought generally inhibited root production and
   development and the degree of inhibition was between 2 and 22\%.
   Regardless of the soil moisture condition, traits which differentiated
   the RSA included root biomass, root numbers, root branching density, and
   total root length, and these were also the important contributory traits
   to variability under well-watered soil conditions. Important
   contributory traits to variability traits under drought were
   shoot-related traits such as leaf area and shoot biomass, and also root
   system traits such as nodal root number, root biomass, diameter and
   branching density. Phenotypic plasticity was found in most traits where
   the number, branching density and diameter of upper nodal roots
   presented the highest RDPI. These traits corresponded with the traits
   contributing greatly to variation. Plastic responses of cassava to
   drought were dependent on trait and genotype. It is concluded that upper
   nodal roots-related traits could have importance in breeding cassava to
   better tolerate water deficit conditions. The secondary growth and
   ability to maintain or increase the upper nodal root count or density
   under limited soil moisture may be related to good growth and yield
   performance of cassava under drought conditions. Upper nodal roots could
   be used to screen and select cassava genotypes adapted to drought at the
   juvenile stage but as a potential indirect selection strategy, the
   persistence and pertinence of these traits and their relationship with
   yield and yield components under drought conditions in the field must be
   confirmed.},

Abstract = {Soil properties and plants influence soil microbial community diversity,
   and their role in nutrient cycling could influence plant productivity;
   however, it is not clear the relationships between soil bacterial
   communities, soil moisture, and nitrogen (N) content, and whether these
   associations influence plant productivity. In this study, we
   investigated how the soil microbial community affects root zone
   productivity in winter wheat. We also verified whether productivity can
   be improved by water adjustment and N management in drip irrigation
   field experiments (I0, natural condition; I1, jointing to heading stage
   S1 55\%-80\%theta(f), field capacity, anthesis to mature stage S2
   70\%-80\%theta(f); I2, S1 55\%-90\%theta(f), S2 70\%-90\%theta(f); and
   I3, S1 55\%-100\%theta(f), S2 70\%-100\%theta(f)) and under different N
   application rates (N0, N1, N2, and N3 represent 0, 150, 200, and 250 kg
   N ha(-1)). Soil moisture and N application rate significantly influenced
   water use efficiency (WUE), N use efficiency (NUE), yield, and soil
   bacterial abundance and diversity in the wheat root zone. N application
   decreased the richness indices in un-irrigated soils (I0), whereas it
   initially increased, and then decreased the indices in irrigated soils
   (I1, I2, and I3). The primary factor influencing the dominant bacterial
   taxa was soil moisture content (SMC), followed by root length density
   (RLD). The root system and soil bacterial diversity strong influenced
   wheat yield. The I1N1 treatment resulted in the highest root weight
   density (RWD), WUE, and NUE, and thus increased wheat yield;
   furthermore, it had the least influence on the diversity of soil
   bacteria. Our work suggests that the response of bacterial communities
   to soil moisture and nitrogen content largely regulates crop production
   in agro-ecosystems, and that regulating soil moisture and nitrogen
   fertilizer use may provide a sustainable solution for maintaining
   farmland productivity.},

Abstract = {Soil fertility (SF) is a crucial factor that directly impacts the
   performance and quality of crop production. To investigate the SF status
   in agricultural lands of winter wheat in Khuzestan province, 811 samples
   were collected from the soil surface (0-25 cm). Eleven soil properties,
   i.e., electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total
   nitrogen (TN), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), available phosphorus
   (P-av), exchangeable potassium (K-ex), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc
   (Zn), manganese (Mn), and soil pH, were measured in the samples. The
   Nutrient Index Value (NIV) was calculated based on wheat nutritional
   requirements. The results indicated that 100\%, 93\%, and 74\% of the
   study areas for CCE, pH, and EC fell into the low, moderate, and
   moderate to high NIV classes, respectively. Also, 25\% of the area is
   classified as low fertility (NIV < 1.67), 75\% falls under medium
   fertility (1.67 < NIV value < 2.33), and none in high fertility (NIV
   value > 2.33). Assessment of the mean wheat yield (AWY) and its
   comparison with NIV showed that the highest yield was in the Ramhormoz
   region (5200 kg.ha(-1)), while the lowest yield was in the Hendijan
   region (3000 kg.ha(-1)) with the lowest EC rate in the study area.
   Elevated levels of salinity and CCE in soils had the most negative
   impact on irrigated WY, while P-av, TN, and Mn availability showed
   significant effects on crop production. Therefore, implementing SF
   management practices is essential for both quantitative and qualitative
   improvement in irrigated wheat production in Khuzestan province.},

Title = {Impacts of a hydroinfiltrator rainwater harvesting system on soil
   moisture regime and groundwater distribution for olive groves in
   semi-arid Mediterranean regions},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {438},

Abstract = {Dry periods in semi-arid regions constitute one of the greatest
   hazardous features that agriculture faces. This study investigates the
   effects of using a new device called `Hydroinfiltrator Rainwater
   Harvesting System (HRHS) on the water balance of soils. It was designed
   for arid and semi-arid zones affected by long periods of drought
   punctuated by heavy rainstorms. The new hydroinfiltrator consists of a
   net-like shell filled mainly with biochar. It is cylindrical in shape,
   is placed vertically and is half-buried in the soil around the crop tree
   to facilitate the infiltration of rainwater, irrigation or runoff water
   deep into the soil. The experimental plot is located in Baena (C \&
   PRIME;ordoba, southern Spain) in an olive grove where the
   hydroinfiltrator was installed in 90 olive trees while 10 were left as a
   control group. In the xeric climate (bordering on arid), typical of the
   region, soils without a hydroinfiltrator have had a low infiltration
   rate, which reduces the effectiveness of precipitation and significantly
   increases the risk of water erosion. The effects of infiltration
   assisted by the device were analysed by simulating a torrential rain in
   which 600 L of water were passed through the hydroinfiltrator on an
   olive tree which had been installed 3 years previously. Geophysical
   methods (electrical resistivity tomography, ERT), direct analyses of
   soil samples, both in situ and in the laboratory, and theoretical flow
   models indicated a very significant increase in soil moisture (which
   nearly tripled in respect to the control group) because water was
   absorbed into the soil quickly, preventing runoff and water erosion. The
   soil moisture at 20 cm depth was 2.97 times higher with the HRHS than in
   the control plots. In addition, olive production increased by 211\% and
   was higher in fat yield by 177\%. Moreover, the resistivity profiles,
   taken by ERT showed that the water that entered the soil accumulated in
   the root zone of the olive tree, encouraged by the preferential pathways
   created by the roots and away from the surface, which prevented rapid
   evaporation during the high temperatures of spring and summer. Here we
   show for the first time that the use of the hydroinfiltrator rainwater
   harvesting system represents a significant improvement in the use of
   scarce water resources caused by climate change, providing agronomic and
   environmental benefits for rainfed, Mediterranean agricultural systems.},

   MF = 10 Mg ha(-1) of biochar+MF; B10+ PM = 10 Mg ha(-1) of biochar+PM.
   The highest onion yield (39.9 Mg ha(-1)) was obtained in 2017 with the
   biochar rate of 5.9 Mg ha(-1) while an increase of 308 kg ha(-1) in
   onion yield was found for each Mg ha(-1) of biochar added to soil in
   2018. The use of biochar combined with mineral fertilizers increased

Abstract = {The agricultural sector faces a massive challenge in enhancing food

   effective and optimum utilization of fresh water, developing smart
   irrigation systems based on the internet of things (IoT) is essential
   for scheduling irrigation based on crop water requirements. In this
   study, an IoT-based irrigation system was developed and evaluated inside
   a greenhouse located in the experimental fields of Indian Council of
   Agricultural Research-Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering
   (ICAR-CIAE), Bhopal, India. Data on microenvironmental parameters such
   as temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, soil temperature and
   soil moisture were collected from the sensors developed inside the
   greenhouse. Soil moisture was predicted based on the field data
   collected via different machine learning techniques, such as the
   decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), multiple linear regression
   (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and
   artificial neural network (ANN) methods, with three input combinations.
   The ANN (coefficient of determination {[}R2] = 0.942, 0.939) models
   performed well but were found to be less effective than the RF (R2 =
   0.991, 0.951) and XGB (R2 = 0.997, 0.941) models in the training and

   other models, while the MLR (R2 = 0.955, 0.875) technique
   underperformed. With respect to both the testing and training datasets,
   the models trained with all four inputs outperformed the models trained

Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},

Abstract = {Lake fluctuations in river-lake-basin (RLB) systems are highly complex
   because of the significant interactions of various hydrological
   variables. Clarifying these interactions would be helpful for
   understanding the physical mechanisms of lake fluctuations and improving
   responses to extreme hydrological events (i.e., drought or flood).
   Though numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the flow
   between rivers and lakes (river-lake interaction), research on the
   hydrological processes between a lake and its surrounding basin
   (lake-basin interaction) remains rare. This study investigates
   lake-basin interactions by examining the changes in the water
   distribution between the land and a lake with an examination of the
   Poyang Lake region, China. Specifically, this study first estimates
   water storage by employing the water balance model. Then, the spatial
   and temporal correlations between the lake area and soil moisture are
   examined to capture the lake-land interaction. The results show that the
   region's annual water storage has decreased in recent decades and varies
   in different months. Specifically, more water in the region is stored in
   the lake before July, and increasing amounts of water are held on land
   after that. Spatially, soil moisture is low in the region near the lake
   in summer because of the high radiation of water reflectance, which
   enhances evapotranspiration. By contrast, soil moisture is high in other
   seasons because of the flow from top to bottom. It can be concluded that
   soil moisture could mitigate the change in water storage due to the
   shrinkage of Poyang Lake, which is characterized by significant spatial
   and temporal variabilities. The results of this study help elucidate the
   dynamics and distribution of water resources in similar RLB systems,
   support water management and promote local sustainable development.},

Abstract = {Ab s t r a c t. At present there is little information available
   con-cerning the relationship between the tillage system applied and the
   soil moisture tension, penetration resistance, soil moisture content,
   and temperature responses to the temporal variability of precipita-tion
   under the semi-arid Mediterranean environment. The aim of this study was
   to determine the effects of standard tillage (plough-ing to 25-35 cm)
   and conservation tillage shallow (loosening to 10 cm) on temporal
   changes in the three properties in response to the precipitation pattern
   in Croatia. The temporal changes in soil moisture tension were
   determined using Watermark sensors (at 15 and 30 cm), and penetration
   resistance (at 0-30 cm) was deter-mined with an Eijkelkamp penetrometer
   in spring under winter wheat. After heavy precipitation, the soil
   moisture tensions were similar irrespective of the tillage system used
   and the measure-ment depth, while with the increasing length of the
   period without precipitation (using the last precipitation incident as
   the starting timepoint), the soil moisture tensions increased to a
   greater extent under conservation tillage shallow as compared to
   standard tillage. The temporal changes in soil moisture tension in
   response to pre-cipitation were less sensitive at the 30 than at the 15
   cm depth. The adoption of conservation tillage shallow increased the
   amount of topsoil organic matter as compared to standard tillage. This
   study indicates that conservation tillage shallow is a promising
   practice in terms of soil quality improvement and crop productivity
   under highly variable Mediterranean climate conditions.},

Title = {Cross-Evaluation of Soil Moisture Based on the Triple Collocation Method
   and a Preliminary Application of Quality Control for Station
   Observations in China},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) measurements from ground stations are often after
   quality control (QC) in the operational system, but the QC flags may not
   be reliable in some cases when precipitation events or manual watering
   happen. This study applies the triple collocation (TC) method to conduct
   a cross-evaluation of SM data from ERA5 reanalysis estimates, ESA-CCI
   estimates, and similar to 2000 ground stations across the China domain.
   The results show that all datasets can capture the spatial pattern of SM
   in China. TC-based correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square
   error (RMSE) show that the station data have worse performance in
   western and central China. For most stations, TC-based CC is between 0.6
   similar to 0.9, and TC-based RMSE is between 0.01 similar to 0.06
   m(3)/m(3). In addition, TC-based metrics show good agreement with the CC
   between precipitation and SM, indicating that these metrics can reflect
   the quality of station data. We further selected typical stations (e.g.,
   CC <= 0.2, RMSE >= 0.06 m(3)/m(3)) to check the quality of the QC
   procedure. The comparison shows that TC-based metrics can better
   represent the actual quality for these stations compared to raw QC
   flags. This study indicates that TC has the potential to detect
   problematic stations and could be a supplement to traditional QC of
   station observations.},

Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Growing concerns about urban runoff pollution and water scarcity caused
   by urbanization have prompted the application of bioretention facilities
   to manage urban stormwater. The purpose of this study was to evaluate
   the performance of proposed bioretention facilities regarding road
   runoff pollutant removal and the variation characteristics of the media
   physicochemical properties and microbial diversity in dry-cold regions.
   Two types of bioretention facilities were designed and then constructed
   in Tianjin Eco-city, China, on the basis of combined soil filter media
   screened by a laboratory-scale test with a modified bioretention
   facility (MBF) containing soil moisture conservation ropes. Redundancy
   analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between the
   variation in media physicochemical properties and microbial communities.
   An increase in media moisture could promote an increase in the relative
   abundance of several dominant microbial communities. In the MBF, the
   relatively low nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) (0.75 mg/L) and total nitrogen
   (TN) (4.71 mg/L) effluent concentrations, as well as better removal
   efficiencies for TN and NO3-N in challenge tests, were mainly attributed
   to the greater relative abundance of Proteobacteria (25.2\%) that are
   involved in the microbial nitrogen transformation process. The MBF also
   had greater media microbial richness (5253 operational taxonomic units)
   compared to the conventional bioretention facility and in situ saline
   soils. The results indicate that stormwater runoff treated by both
   bioretention facilities has potential use for daily greening and road
   spraying. The proposed design approach for bioretention facilities is
   applicable to LID practices and sustainable stormwater management in
   other urban regions.},

Title = {Reconstruction of Global Long-Term Gap-Free Daily Surface Soil Moisture
   from 2002 to 2020 Based on a Pixel-Wise Machine Learning Method},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Global, long-term, gap-free, high quality soil moisture products are
   extremely important for hydrological monitoring and climate change
   research. However, soil moisture products produced from satellite
   observations have data gaps due to the limited capabilities of satellite
   orbit/swath and retrieval algorithms, which limit the regional and
   global applications of soil moisture data in hydrology and agriculture
   studies. To solve this problem, we proposed a gap-filling method to
   reconstruct a global gap-free surface soil moisture product by applying
   the machine learning (Random Forest) algorithm on a pixel-by-pixel
   basis, taking into account the nonlinear relationship between surface
   soil moisture and the related surface environmental variables. The
   gap-filling method was applied to the NN-SM surface soil moisture
   product, which has a fraction of data gaps of around 50\% globally on a
   multi-year average. A global daily gap-free surface soil moisture
   dataset from 2002 to 2020 was then generated. The reconstructed values
   of several sub-regions after manually eliminating the original values
   were cross-verified with the original data, and this clearly
   demonstrated the reliability of the reconstruction method with the
   correlation coefficient (R) ranging between 0.770 and 0.918, the Root
   Mean Square Error (RMSE) between 0.057 and 0.082 m(3)/m(3), the unbiased
   Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) between 0.053 and 0.081 m(3)/m(3), and
   Bias between -0.012 and 0.008 m(3)/m(3). The accuracy of the
   reconstructed surface soil moisture dataset was evaluated using in situ
   observations of surface soil moisture at 12 sites from the International
   Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research
   (LTAR) network, and the results showed good accuracy in terms of R
   (0.610), RMSE (0.067 m(3)/m(3)), ubRMSE (0.045 m(3)/m(3)) and Bias
   (0.031 m(3)/m(3)). Overall, the reconstructed surface soil moisture
   dataset retained the characteristics of the NN-SM product, such as high
   accuracy and good spatiotemporal pattern. However, with the advantage of
   continuous spatiotemporal coverage, it is more suitable for further
   applications in the analysis of global surface soil moisture trends,
   land surface hydrological processes, and land-atmosphere energy and
   water exchanges, etc.},

Abstract = {We investigated the effects of soil moisture and its correction method
   for on-site XRF analysis of hazardous metals in polluted soil. A wet
   soil sample was prepared by exposing the water mist generated from the
   ultrasonic humidifier to dry soil for 0-95 min to reach the soil water
   content to 0-30 mass\%. Calibration curves of six hazardous metals (Cr,
   As, Se, Cd, Hg, and Pb) measured from the soil certified reference
   materials JSAC 0461 to 0466 were compared with the water content changed
   from 0 to 30 mass\%. The inclinations of calibration curves of six
   metals decreased with the increase of the water content. In addition,
   the XRF intensities of six metals decreased about 15\%-20\% by adding
   the water in 30 mass\%. It was revealed that the soil moisture effect is
   caused by two factors as a decrease of the amount of analyte in the XRF
   generating area, and a change in the sample matrix due to increase of
   water contents. Thus, a new correction method using the combination
   between Compton scattered X-rays and the water contents was applied to
   overcome the soil moisture effect. Applying the proposed correction
   method, calibration curves of six metals with different water content
   gave identical inclinations of calibration curves. The analytical
   results of chromium in the geochemical reference sample were in good
   agreement with the standard value even with increased water content.},

Title = {Improvement of the ``Triangle Method{''} for Soil Moisture Retrieval
   Using ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-2: Results over a Heterogeneous
   Agricultural Field in Northern India},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {For the purpose of deriving spatiotemporal estimates of soil moisture,
   the triangle method is one of the most widely used approaches today
   utilizing remote sensing data. Generally, those techniques are based on
   the physical relationships that exist when a satellite-derived land
   surface temperature (Ts) is plotted against a spectral vegetation index
   (VI). The present study proposes an improvement in the triangle method
   in retrieving soil moisture over heterogeneous areas. In particular, it
   proposes a new approach in robustly identifying the extreme points
   required for the technique's implementation. Those extreme points are
   then used in calculating fractional vegetation cover (Fr) and scaled Ts.
   Furthermore, the study proposes a new approach for calculating the
   coefficients required to develop the relationships between surface soil
   moisture (SSM) and Fr/Ts, which is implemented using a model and field
   data. As a case study, an agricultural field in the Varanasi district in
   India has been used, on which the triangle method is implemented using
   ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-2 data. The much-improved spatial resolution
   satellite data of similar to 70 m from ECOSTRESS allowed deriving more
   vivid results of SSM spatial variability for the study area. Comparisons
   between field soil moisture calculated using the proposed method
   returned an RMSE of 0.03 and R-2 value of 0.84, which are considered
   very satisfactory. The methodology proposed herein and the results
   obtained are of significant value with regards to the triangle method,
   contributing to ongoing efforts at present examining its use for
   operational product development at a global scale.},

Title = {A GNSS-IR Method for Retrieving Soil Moisture Content from Integrated
   Multi-Satellite Data That Accounts for the Impact of Vegetation Moisture
   Content},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {There are two problems with using global navigation satellite
   system-interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) to retrieve the soil
   moisture content (SMC) from single-satellite data: the difference
   between the reflection regions, and the difficulty in circumventing the
   impact of seasonal vegetation growth on reflected microwave signals.
   This study presents a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) SMC
   retrieval model based on integrated multi-satellite data on the impact
   of the vegetation moisture content (VMC). The normalized microwave
   reflection index (NMRI) calculated with the multipath effect is mapped
   to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate and
   eliminate the impact of VMC. A MARS model for retrieving the SMC from
   multi-satellite data is established based on the phase shift. To examine
   its reliability, the MARS model was compared with a multiple linear
   regression (MLR) model, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model,
   and a support vector regression (SVR) model in terms of the retrieval
   accuracy with time-series observation data collected at a typical
   station. The MARS model proposed in this study effectively retrieved the
   SMC, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.916 and a
   root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.021 cm(3)/cm(3). The elimination of
   the vegetation impact led to 3.7\%, 13.9\%, 11.7\%, and 16.6\% increases
   in R-2 and 31.3\%, 79.7\%, 49.0\%, and 90.5\% decreases in the RMSE for
   the SMC retrieved by the MLR, BPNN, SVR, and MARS model, respectively.
   The results demonstrated the feasibility of correcting the vegetation
   changes based on the multipath effect and the reliability of the MARS
   model in retrieving the SMC.},

   Improves Soil Nitrogen Mineralization in a Double Rice-Cropping System},
Journal = {AGRONOMY-BASEL},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The partial replacement of chemical fertilizer with straw return is
   considered an effective method for improving the accumulation of organic
   matter and soil fertility, but the characteristics of soil nitrogen
   fixation and mineralization in a double-cropped rice paddy system are
   unclear. Based on a 12-year field experiment, we conducted a waterlogged
   incubation experiment for 49 days to determine the effect of long-term
   straw return combined with reducing chemical fertilizer application on
   the dynamic changes of mineralized soil nitrogen (N) content and
   mineralized N rate under the treatments, including NPK (chemical
   fertilizers application with straw removal), SBR (straw burned return),
   and SR (straw return). Results showed that, compared with SBR and NPK,
   SR significantly increased available nitrogen by 7.4\% and 16.5\%,
   respectively, due to the higher ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen,
   as well as the total carbon, available phosphorus, and slowly available
   potassium, suggesting that it could stock a sufficient nitrogen source.
   During the incubation period, the amount of N mineralization was
   relatively higher under SR than under SBR and NPK treatments, especially
   during the later mineralization time, whereas there was no difference in
   the N mineralization rate. In addition, SR significantly increased soil
   cumulative N mineralization and N mineralization potential. However, SBR
   significantly decreased the soil mineralizable N ratio compared with SR
   and NPK, which may result in a worsening of the N mineralization
   potential. The results indicated that long-term straw return combined
   with reducing chemical fertilizer application could significantly
   improve the N supply capacity of paddy rice field soil to better
   coordinate the soil N supply and immobilization.},

Title = {Effects of vegetation patterns on soil nitrogen and phosphorus losses on
   the slope-gully system of the Loess Plateau},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {324},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The slope-gully system, the erosion unit on the Loess Plateau, suffers
   from severe soil erosion and loss of soil nutrients. Restoring
   vegetation can effectively reduce soil erosion, thereby reducing the
   loss of nitrogen and phosphorus. In the Loess Plateau, owing to the
   shortage of water resources and the adverse effects of
   over-revegetation, the restoration of vegetation in large areas is
   limited. To efficiently prevent the loss of soil nu-trients and reduce
   non-point source pollution, vegetation patterns need to be reasonably
   restored. However, it is currently not clear as to how this can be
   achieved. Different slope-gully systems were established in this study,
   including pattern A (no vegetation), pattern B (up-slope vegetation),
   pattern C (middle-slope vegetation), and pattern D (down-slope
   vegetation). Then, the effects of vegetation patterns on soil total
   nitrogen (TN) and soil total phosphorus (TP) losses associated with
   runoff and sediment processes was quantitatively evaluated through the
   simulated rainfall. The results showed that (1) vegetation pattern
   markedly affected the yields of runoff, sediment, soil nitrogen, and
   soil phosphorus, resulting in the following order: pattern A > pattern B
   > pattern C > pattern D. (2) The correlation between TN and runoff was
   higher than that between TN and sediment; conversely, TP was more
   strongly correlated with sediment than with runoff. (3) Nitrogen loss
   with runoff was the main source of TN (58.76-90.74\%), while phosphorus
   loss with sediment was the main source of TP (48.51-89.30\%). Compared
   with other vegetation patterns, the down-slope can more effectively
   reduce the yields of runoff and sediment, thereby reducing the loss of
   TN and TP. Therefore, it was suggested that the lower part of the slope
   should be considered when revegetating.},

Abstract = {Reduced-tillage systems that augment soil inorganic N availability while
   reducing N losses can improve the nitrogen-use efficiency of cover
   crop-based organic cropping systems. We conducted a three year full
   factorial field experiment in the upper Midwest, USA to examine the

   vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) cover crop mixture on (1) soil inorganic
   nitrogen (N) concentrations throughout the growing season, (2) sweet
   corn (Zea mays L.) crop productivity and N uptake, and (3) potential N
   loss via denitrification and leaching. We compared full-width tillage
   (FWT) vs. strip-tillage (ST) with and without a rye-vetch cover crop. ST
   decreased soil inorganic N concentrations 16-40\% compared to FWT, with
   soil inorganic N higher in the tilled in-row zone compared to the
   undisturbed between-row zone in 1 of 3 years. The rye-vetch cover crop
   did not provide a consistent increase in soil inorganic N. ST increased
   soil leachate N concentrations by similar to 50\% and increased the
   potential for denitrification by 18\% but depressed sweet corn biomass
   and N contents in only one of three years, when hairy vetch biomass and
   soil moisture was lowest. We conclude that utilizing ST in combination
   with a cover crop is not likely to improve N use efficiency or crop
   yields, and may increase N losses within an organic cover crop-based

Abstract = {In order to clarify the influence of jujube and cotton intercropping
   patterns on key soil enzymes, this paper has established different test
   groups including: Plant 2 rows of cotton (M1) in the middle of the red
   dates; 4 rows of cotton (M2) in the middle of the red dates; plant 6
   rows of cotton (M3) in the middle of the red dates, with a cotton
   spacing of 12.5cm, artificially sown. And red jujube monocropping (CK-J)
   and cotton monocropping (CK-C) were set as controls, and the effects of
   soil urease, alkaline protease, dehydrogenase, hydroxylamine reductase,
   and nitrate reductase in the soil at different depths were measured. The
   results showed that: (1) Different enzymes have different soil nitrogen
   assimilation enzyme activities under different treatments. However, the
   overall observation found that the content of urease, alkaline protease,
   dehydrogenase, hydroxylamine reductase, and nitrate reductase in the
   soil treated with M1 was not only higher in the soil at different
   depths. At the same time, it is also lower than most soil nitrogen
   conversion enzyme activities in the control group, and soil available
   nitrogen loss is higher; (2) The soil enzyme activity of single cropping
   treatment was significantly lower than that of intercropping treatment;
   (3) Different enzyme activities under M2 and M3 treatments gradually
   increased with the increase of soil depth, so the best planting modes
   are M2 and M3.},

Year = {2024},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cyanobacteria are promising alternatives to chemical fertilizers for
   managing nutrients and preserving soil function. In this study, two pot
   experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of inoculations with
   the cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica on an arable Mollisol from the
   U.S. Upper Midwest and growth of spring wheat. Experiment 1 evaluated
   surface soil nutrient and microbial dynamics at early stages of wheat
   development. Experiment 2 evaluated the potential of microalgal
   inoculations (A. cylindrica and/or Chlamydomonas sp.) to replace urea
   and measured plant growth and soil parameters at three depths at
   harvest. Experiment 1 revealed inoculation increased surface soil
   soluble organic carbon (SolC), microbial biomass carbon (C), total
   nitrogen (N), mineral N, available phosphorus (P), and microbial
   activity. At day 42 after sowing, wheat plant N was higher in inoculated
   than non-inoculated soil, and the nitrate/nitrite level in inoculated
   soil significantly decreased in the presence of plants. In Experiment 2,
   inoculation had greater effects on surface soil than deeper soil depths
   for SolC, microbial biomass C and N, mineral N, and available-P. Grain
   yield was not statistically different in treatments with 100 \% N from
   urea, 75 \% N from A. cylindrica plus 25 \% N-urea, and 100 \% N from an
   algal mixture. Equivalent grain protein was achieved only when 25 \% N
   from urea was replaced with N from A. cylindrica, highlighting the need
   for optimizing inoculation timing and plant N uptake. These results
   support the beneficial role of cyanobacteria-based inoculations for soil
   quality and plant growth, and as renewable resources for agricultural
   systems.},

Abstract = {New age challenges of irrational use of fertilizers under monocropping
   of rice calls for integrative nutrient management strategy along with

   nutrient status in short grain aromatic rice-green gram cropping system.
   The experiment was set up in split plot design with six nutrient
   management strategies in rice were taken in main plot in randomized
   block design and three nutrient management strategies in green gram were
   taken as sub plot in split-plot design in sequence. Results revealed
   that application of 50\% NPK+ 50\% Recommended Dose of Nitrogen
   (RDN)-FYM to rice followed by 75\% NPK + Rhizobium + Phosphorus
   Solubilizing Bacteria to green gram recorded the highest rice equivalent
   yield and production efficiency in 2017-18 and 2018-19 followed by 50\%

   Application of 50\% NPK+ 50\% RDN-FYM to rice and 75\% NPK + Rhizobium +
   PSB to green gram recorded the highest partial factor productivity of

   in the system. Soil nutrient status of the cropping system improved with
   balanced application of organic and inorganic sources of nutrients

Abstract = {Ridge-furrow mulching patterns are beneficial to improve crop yields and
   rainwater use efficiency, but it is not clear whether they can improve
   productivity and simultaneously maintain soil fertility on the Loess
   Plateau of China. A three-year (2013-2016) field trial was conducted
   during the rotation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - maize (Zea mays
   L.) to investigate the effects of ridge-furrow mulching patterns on soil
   moisture, soil fertility, grain yield, and water use efficiency (WUE).
   Four ridge-furrow planting patterns included: (1) white plastic film
   mulch over the ridge (RW), (2) straw mulch over the furrow (RS), (3)
   white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow
   (RWS), and (4) black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch
   over the furrow (RBS). Flat planting without mulch was CK. The results
   showed that RW, RS, RWS, and RBS significantly improved soil water
   storage and aboveground biomass throughout each winter wheat and summer
   maize growing season compared with CK. Finally, winter wheat grain yield
   and WUE in the four mulching treatments markedly increased by
   13.0-32.9\% and 22.5-41.5\% in a wet and cool season, 15.5-35.2\% and
   19.3-41.9\% in a season with normal rainfall and temperatures, and
   27.2-58.9\% and 15.3-33.4\% in a dry and warm season, respectively.
   Maize grain yield and WUE increased by 12.8-35.0\% and 19.5-46.2\% in a
   season with normal rainfall and temperature, 15.0-38.5\% and 18.0-39.9\%
   in a dry and cool season, and 17.4-50.5\% and 13.0-42.5\% in a dry and
   warm season, respectively. Among the four mulching treatments, RWS and
   RBS significantly improved the yield and WUE of wheat and maize relative
   to RW and RS over the three years. After three years, soil total
   nitrogen content in RWS and RBS was significantly greater than in RS.
   Besides, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil dissolved
   organic carbon and nitrogen contents in RWS and RBS were all markedly
   higher than in RW and RS. Our results indicated that RWS and RBS were a
   promising agricultural practice that improved crop production and
   simultaneously maintained soil fertility in a rain-fed semi-arid region
   of China.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to explore the effect of Chinese milk vetch (CMV) on
   soil fertility and rice production in double rice cropping systems. A
   field experiment was conducted including the following six treatments:
   Ck (no NPK mineral fertilizer and no CMV), CMV0 (NPK mineral fertilizer
   and no CMV), and CMV1-4 (NPK mineral fertilizer and 7500 kg ha(-1) CMV,
   15,000 kg ha(-1) CMV, 22,500 kg ha(-1) CMV, 30,000 kg ha(-1) CMV) from
   2008 to 2018. The results showed that the application of CMV enhanced
   the organic matter, the total nitrogen, the available phosphorus, pH,
   and enzyme activities (except for the cellulase) in paddy soils. The
   organic matter and total nitrogen of CMV3 were increased by 15.99\% and
   8.07\% compared with CMV0 and the increase rate of the organic matter
   and total nitrogen was by an average of 0.413 and 0.029 g kg(-1) per
   year compared with the initial soil, respectively. The CMV return also
   improved the enzyme activities (except for the cellulase). Meanwhile,
   the CMV returned to soil increased dramatically the yields of early
   rice, late rice, and double rice by 13.46\%-26.23\%, 13.63\%-20.84\%,
   and 13.55\%-25.76\% compared with CMV0, respectively. The yields of
   early rice, late rice, and double rice of the CMV3 were highest among
   all the treatments. The application of CMV improved the agronomic
   efficiency (AE) and the partial factor productivity (PFP), especially
   for CMV3. The AE and PFP values of double rice for CMV3 increased by
   64.54\% and 25.76\%, respectively. The application of CMV also increased
   the sustainability index and reduced the coefficient of variation of the
   rice yields. In addition, there was negative linear relationship between
   the amount of CMV needed to generate higher yields of double rice and
   the years of CMV application. In conclusion, CMV addition at
   15,000-22,500 kg ha(-1) combined with mineral fertilizer had beneficial
   effects on the productivity, the stability of rice yield as well as the
   fertilizer efficiency in double rice cropping system.},

Abstract = {A field experiment (2017-2019) was undertaken to study the short-term

   fertilizer and 25\% N as vermicompost] on yield and soil quality under a
   maize-rice rotation system. Among N sources, NS4 produced the highest
   maize grain yield (10 Mg.ha?(1)). Residual effects of N sources on mean
   rice grain yield were evident only in crop residue (NS2)- and
   vermicompost (NS4)-treated plots. After the harvest of two complete
   maize-rice crop cycles, higher content of dehydrogenase activity (DHA)
   and urease activity (UR) were observed in the soil under AT as compared
   to ZT and CT at 0-10 cm (p < 0.05). Similarly, microbial biomass carbon
   (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) also recorded positive
   changes at 0-10 cm soil depth, especially in NS2 and NS4 treatments. AT
   resulted in the highest total soil carbon (TOC) (8.10 g.kg(-1)),
   followed by CT (6.73 g.kg(-1)) and ZT (5.98 g.kg(-1)). Fertilizer N
   treatments, however, influenced the NO3-N accumulation beyond the root

   the highest NO3-N (32.52 kg.ha(-1)), and the lowest NO3-N (14.48
   kg.ha(-1)) was observed in the FYM-based (NS3) treatment. Therefore, the
   practice of alternate tillage and integration of vermicompost (40
   kg.N.ha(-1)) and chemical fertilizer (total 120 kg.ha(-1)) sources
   should be mostly recommended to farmers in the Terai region of India.},

Abstract = {The diverse and multi-component nature of traditional agroforestry
   systems (AFS) provides them a unique edge over monoculture cropping,
   particularly in arid and semi-arid ecosystems due to their role in
   providing several ecosystem services (ES) in addition to their prime
   role in agricultural production. Appropriate selection of components and
   their management practices results in reduced competition for resources
   among the components and maximum capitalization of the interactions.
   Poplar-based AFS adopted in a big way by farmers in the Indo-Gangetic
   region of India has improved their economic status due to its high
   industrial value. The present study discusses the effect Populus
   deltoides as windbreak on yield of wheat as intercrop and soil nutrient
   status. We considered winter wheat varieties (WH-1105, WH-542, HD-2967,
   HD-943 and DPW-621-50) during two consecutive years (2013-15) delimited
   by a row of poplar trees in the east-west and north-south directions.
   Whereas effects on crop produce were limited for all wheat varieties
   with increasing distance from the tree line, considerable yield
   reductions were found near the tree line (treatments T-1 and T-2) for
   all the wheat varieties. The highest available soil N (365.2 kg ha(-1)),
   P (19.7 kg ha(-1)) and K (357.3 kg ha(-1)) were recorded near the tree
   line at a distance of 2 m. To optimize the provisioning service of
   poplar windbreak AFS, the cultivation of highly shade-tolerant wheat
   variety HD-2967 may be advisable over other varieties towards the end of
   the rotation of mature poplar trees.},

Abstract = {Cadmium (Cd) exposure is related to a multitude of adverse health
   outcomes because food crops grown on Cdpolluted soil are widely consumed

   production (GVP) under a rotation system. Five fruit vegetables were
   cultivated as the second season crop in the same plots which have been
   used for pakchoi as the first season crop (with or without LZBC
   application). The results indicated that LZBC with the consecutive
   application (T3) promoted crops biomass and fruit yield the most,
   followed by LZBC with the second crop application (T2) and LZBC with the
   first crop application (T1). LZBC application showed increasing
   rhizosphere soil pH and improvement in soil fertility of all crops
   including available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium,
   organic matter, and cation exchange capacity. LZBC had positive
   influences on soluble sugar, soluble protein, and vitamin C in edible
   parts of 5 vegetables. Cd contents in fruit, shoot, and root of
   eggplant, pimento, cowpea, and tomato except cucumber were reduced by
   adding LZBC. As for the economic performance, T3 had the highest

   T3 was dramatically more effective for minimizing health risk,
   increasing production, and facilitating sustainable utilization of soil

Abstract = {Extreme flooding over southern Louisiana in mid-August of 2016 resulted
   from an unusual tropical low that formed and intensified over land. We
   used numerical experiments to highlight the role of the `Brown Ocean'
   effect (where saturated soils function similar to a warm ocean surface)
   on intensification and it's modulation by land cover change. A numerical
   modeling experiment that successfully captured the flood event (control)
   was modified to alter moisture availability by converting wetlands to
   open water, wet croplands, and dry croplands. Storm evolution in the
   control experiment with wet antecedent soils most resembles tropical
   lows that form and intensify over oceans. Irrespective of soil moisture
   conditions, conversion of wetlands to croplands reduced storm intensity,
   and also, nonsaturated soils reduced rain by 20\% and caused shorter
   durations of high intensity wind conditions. Developing agricultural
   croplands and more so restoring wetlands and not converting them into
   open water can impede intensification of tropical systems that affect
   the area.},

Title = {A New Coupled Elimination Method of Soil Moisture and Particle Size
   Interferences on Predicting Soil Total Nitrogen Concentration through
   Discrete NIR Spectral Band Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Rapid and accurate measurement of high-resolution soil total nitrogen
   (TN) information can promote variable rate fertilization, protect the
   environment, and ensure crop yields. Many scholars focus on exploring
   the rapid TN detection methods and corresponding soil sensors based on
   spectral technology. However, soil spectra are easily disturbed by many
   factors, especially soil moisture and particle size. Real-time
   elimination of the interferences of these factors is necessary to
   improve the accuracy and efficiency of measuring TN concentration in
   farmlands. Although, many methods can be used to eliminate soil moisture
   and particle size effects on the estimation of soil parameters using
   continuum spectra. However, the discrete NIR spectral band data can be
   completely different in the band attribution with continuum spectra,
   that is, it does not have continuity in the sense of spectra. Thus,
   relevant elimination methods of soil moisture and particle size effects
   on continuum spectra do not apply to the discrete NIR spectral band
   data. To solve this problem, in this study, moisture absorption
   correction index (MACI) and particle size correction index (PSCI)
   methods were proposed to eliminate the interferences of soil moisture
   and particle size, respectively. Soil moisture interference was
   decreased by normalizing the original spectral band data into standard
   spectral band data, on the basis of the strong soil moisture absorption
   band at 1450 nm. For the PSCI method, characteristic bands of soil
   particle size were identified to be 1361 and 1870 nm firstly. Next,
   normalized index N-p, which calculated wavelengths of 1631 and 1870 nm,
   was proposed to eliminate soil particle size interference on discrete
   NIR spectral band data. Finally, a new coupled elimination method of
   soil moisture and particle size interferences on predicting TN
   concentration through discrete NIR spectral band data was proposed and
   evaluated. The six discrete spectral bands (1070, 1130, 1245, 1375,
   1550, and 1680 nm) used in the on-the-go detector of TN concentration
   were selected to verify the new method. Field tests showed that the new
   coupled method had good effects on eliminating interferences of soil
   moisture and soil particle size.},

Abstract = {Earth to Air Heat Exchangers (EAHEs) are reliable complements for
   conventional HVAC systems. During summer, EAHE cooling can help reduce
   energy consumption. In the present study, to evaluate the cooling
   performance of a two-layer EAHE ventilating system, experimental work
   was conducted from May to August 2017. Because EAHE performance largely
   depends on the thermal characteristics of soil, an irrigation system was
   adopted to experimentally verify the effect of soil moisture content.
   Air temperature showed an average drop of 14.6 degrees C and the average
   total cooling capacity was 8792W. The system exhibited a maximum
   coefficient of performance (COP) of 27.2, implying that the system
   provides fresh-air cooling with little electricity input. Under cooling
   mode, the surrounding soil temperature increased continuously due to the
   operation of the system. An irrigation system was adopted to simulate
   natural precipitation; when the soil moisture changed from 0.37
   cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.42 cm(3)/cm(3), air temperature decreased by 1.6
   degrees C at the pipe outlet. The results show that using EAHE under wet
   conditions resulted in a large cooling capacity and COP, which indicates
   that a short pipe length or shallow depth is required for achieving a
   similar cooling capacity under wet soil conditions. (C) 2019 Elsevier

Title = {Evaluating Root-Zone Soil Moisture Products from GLEAM, GLDAS, and ERA5
   Based on In Situ Observations and Triple Collocation Method over the
   Tibetan Plateau},

Abstract = {Root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an important variable in
   land-atmosphere interactions, notably affecting the global climate
   system. Contrary to satellite-based acquisition of surface soil
   moisture, RZSM is generally obtained from model-based simulations. In
   this study, in situ observations from the Naqu and Pali networks that
   represent different climatic conditions over the Tibetan Plateau (TP)
   and a triple collocation (TC) method are used to evaluate model-based
   RZSM products, including Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM)
   (versions 3.5a and 3.5b), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)
   (versions 2.1 and 2.2), and the fifth-generation European Centre for
   Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5). The evaluation results
   based on in situ observations indicate that all products tend to
   overestimate but could generally capture the temporal variation, and
   ERA5 exhibits the best performance with the highest R (0.875) and the
   lowest unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE; 0.015 m(3) m(-3)) against in situ
   observations in the Naqu network. In the TC analysis, similar results
   are obtained: ERA5 has the best performance with the highest TC-derived
   R (0.785) over the entire TP, followed by GLEAM v3.5a (0.746) and
   GLDAS-2.1 (0.682). Meanwhile, GLEAM v3.5a and GLDAS-2.1 outperform GLEAM
   v3.5b and GLDAS-2.2 over the entire TP, respectively. Besides, possible
   error causes in evaluating these RZSM products are summarized, and the
   effectiveness of TC method is also evaluated with two dense networks,
   finding that TC method is reliable since TC-derived R is close to
   ground-derived R, with only 6.85\% mean relative differences. These
   results using both in situ observations and TC method may provide a new
   perspective for the soil moisture product developers to further enhance
   the accuracy of model-based RZSM over the TP. Significance StatementThe
   purpose of this study is to better understand the quality and
   applicability of GLEAM, GLDAS, and ERA5 RZSM products over the TP using
   both in situ observations and the triple collocation (TC) method, making
   it better applied to climate and hydrological research. This study
   provides four standard statistical metrics evaluation based on in situ
   observations, as well as the reliable metric, that is, correlation
   coefficient (R) derived from TC method, and highlights that TC-based
   evaluation could supplement the ground-based validation, especially over
   the data-scarce TP region.},

Title = {Vertical rotary sub-soiling under ridge-furrow with plastic mulching
   system increased crops yield by efficient use of deep soil moisture and
   rainfall},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Recently, the technology of combining vertical rotary sub-soiling (VRT)
   with ridge-furrow construction with plastic film mulching system (RFMS)
   has become a promising solution to improve soil water characteristics
   and crop yields in the semi-arid Loess Plateau, China. However, the
   effect of this technique on deep soil moisture and rainfall utilization
   to enhance the crop yield is unclear. To investigate this, two field
   experiments (2016-2017) were set up with maize and potato as research
   objects. There were four tillage practices under RFMS for maize: (1)
   MVT, VRT to a depth of 40 cm; (2) MST, sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm;
   (3) MTT, rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm; and (4) MZT, zero tillage.
   There were three tillage practices under RFMS for potato: (1) PVT, VRT
   to a depth of 40 cm; (2) PST, sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm; and (3)
   PTT, rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm. Our results showed that the VRT
   under RFMS mainly significantly reduced soil water storage (SWS) in the
   0-100 cm profile at the flowering stage, and SWS in the 100-300 cm
   profile of maize and SWS in the 100-200 cm profile of potato at the
   harvest stage compared with other tillage practices. This increased
   evapotranspiration (ET) throughout the whole growth stage and indicated
   that VRT promoted the utilization of deep soil water (below 100 cm) for
   maize and potato. The increase of ET and utilization of deep soil water
   contributed to promote crop growth, directly improved chlorophyll
   content, accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration
   of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate, resulting in higher water
   use efficiency (WUE), harvest index (HI) and yield. The results
   suggested that VRT under RFMS improved WUE by 3.5-14.6\%, HI by
   2.8-23.85\% and yield by 12.1-47.4\% of maize compared to the other
   treatments and correspondingly by 18.9-92.3\%, 1.6-29.6\%, and
   24.7-156.8\% for potato. In addition, VRT significantly improved fallow
   efficiency by 56.3-133.1\% and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) by
   12.1-47.4\% for maize, and correspondingly by 101.9-272.7\% and
   24.7-156.8\% for potato, compared with other treatments. These data
   indicated VRT can improve the efficiency of precipitation preservation
   and utilization in RFMS. Overall, VRT can efficiently utilize deep soil
   moisture and rainfall to promote crop growth under RFMS,thereby,
   significantly increased maize and potato yields.},

Title = {Retrieval of Soil Moisture Content Based on a Modified Hapke Photometric
   Model: A Novel Method Applied to Laboratory Hyperspectral and Sentinel-2
   MSI Data},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is the crucial carrier of the global hydrologic cycle and
   the dynamic energy balance regulation process. Therefore, it is of great
   significance to monitor surface soil moisture content (SMC) accurately
   for the study of the natural ecological environment. The Hapke model is
   the most widely used photometric model in soil remote sensing research,
   but the development of this model is limited by the lack of valid
   multi-angular data. The main innovations of this paper have two aspects:
   (1) A novel soil moisture retrieval approach based on the Hapke
   (SMR-Hapke) model is derived by exploring the relationship between
   single scattering albedo (SSA) and SMC on the optical bands from 400 to
   2400 nm. The performance of the proposed model was verified on a dataset
   consisting of four different soil samples, and the experimental results
   indicated that the inverted soil moisture from SMR-Hapke model coincided
   with the measurement values, with theR(2)being generally more than 0.9
   in the solar domain. (2) The SMR-Hapke model has been reduced to a
   linear form on the SWIR field and a physically-based normalized
   difference soil moisture indexNDSMIHapke has been proposed. Based on the
   laboratory-based hyperspectral data, we compared the performance
   ofNDSMIHapke with other traditional soil moisture indices using linear
   regression analysis, and the results demonstrate that the
   proposedNDSMIHapke had a great potential for estimating SMC
   withR(2)values of 0.88. Finally, high-resolution SMC map was produced by
   combining the Sentinel-2 MSI data withNDSMIHapke. This study provides a
   novel extended Hapke model for the estimation of surface soil moisture
   content.},

Abstract = {The ecological evolution and relevant factors in semi-arid and arid
   regions is a research focus on climate changes. One such region, the
   mountain-oasis-desert coupling system in Xinjiang, China, is sensitive
   to global climate changes because it has a fragile ecological
   environment. This study attempted to investigate the temporal-spatial
   variations of surface soil moisture, vegetation cover and their
   influencing factors of mountain-oasis-desert coupling system in Xinjiang
   from 1986 to 2015. The results showed that: (1) The surface soil
   moisture increased in most of the ecoregions of Xinjiang from 1986 to
   2015 whereas the vegetation cover decreased in the same period. (2) The
   comparison of the correlations between soil moisture content (SMC) and
   the variables of precipitation and temperature revealed that
   precipitation is an important supplement source of SMC. The variation
   characteristics of surface soil moisture are closely related to the dry
   and wet soil conditions. (3) The comparison of the correlations between
   the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the variables of
   precipitation and temperature revealed that the different responses of
   vegetation to precipitation were related to the gradually decreased
   precipitation pattern in the mountain-oasis-desert system. Meanwhile,
   vegetation was found to be more sensitive to precipitation in deserts
   and oases and more sensitive to temperature in mountainous regions. In
   each ecoregion, the variation cycles of SMC and vegetation cover were
   slightly different, but it was found that SMC is more likely to be
   affected by temperature and precipitation rather than vegetation cover.
   Overall, surface soil moisture and vegetation cover products have a
   great potential to be effectively used in investigating landscape
   pattern variations, which is very important theoretically and
   practically for the mountain-desert-oasis system in arid areas.},

Abstract = {Livestock husbandry has raised enormous environmental concerns around
   the world, including water quality issues. Yet there is a need to
   document long-term water quality trends in livestock-intensive regions
   and reveal the drivers for the trends based on detailed catchment
   monitoring. Here, we assessed the concentration and load trends of
   dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in streamwater of a
   livestock-intensive catchment in southwestern Norway, based on
   continuous flow measurements and flow-proportional composite water
   sampling. Precipitation and catchment-level soil P balance were
   monitored to examine the drivers. At the field level, moreover, the
   relationship between soil P balance and soil test P (measured using the
   ammonium lactate extraction method, PAL) was assessed. Results showed
   that on average of 20 years 95 \% of the P was applied to the catchment
   during March-August, when 40 \% of annual precipitation and 25 \% of
   annual discharge occurred. The low runoff helped reduce P loss following
   P applications. However, flow-weighted annual mean DRP concentration
   significantly increased with increasingly cumulative soil P surplus (R2
   = 0.55, p = 0.0002). With a mean annual P surplus of 8.8 kg ha-1, the
   annual mean DRP concentration (range: 49-140 \& mu;g L-1; mean: 80 \&
   mu;g L-1) and annual DRP load (range: 0.35-1.46 kg ha-1; mean: 0.65 kg
   ha-1) significantly increased over the 20-year monitoring period (p =
   0.001 and 0.0003, respectively). At the field level, P-AL concentrations
   were positively correlated with soil P balances (R2 = 0.48, p < 0.0001),
   confirming the long-term impact of P balances on the risks of P loss.
   The study highlights the predominant role of long-term P balances in
   affecting DRP loss in livestock-intensive regions through the effect on
   soil test P.},

Abstract = {Crop diversification has been identified as a tool to improve both
   productive and environmental performances of organic horticulture. We
   tested the introduction of faba beans in a tomato cropping system-both
   as preceding crop and in strip cropping (SC)-under different
   fertilization strategies-faba residues, animal manure, and vegetable
   compost. We studied: (i) the tomato nutrient uptake and yield and
   quality; (ii) the soil-N and P, the N-budget, and the mycorrhizal
   colonization. SC did not provide consistent positive effects on tomato
   production and quality, namely the N-uptake, N in the tomato yield, the
   mean fruit weight, and the sugar accumulation in berries, regardless of
   the type of fertilizers applied. SC improved the tomato dry yield and
   P-uptake, especially in years when the faba growth and the subsequent
   yield were problematic. Faba residues could provide sufficient N to
   sustain tomato production but care should be given in balancing
   additional N-inputs. Organic fertilization increased the soil-N
   concentration but did not always translate into an increased yield and a
   higher quality production, with the risk of escalating N-losses. SC
   improved the soil-P availability and mycorrhizal colonization in tomato,
   due to the rhizobia-mycorrhiza-mycorrhiza association, especially when
   coupled with organic fertilization. Finally, introducing faba as SC
   holds potential to improve the productive and environmental performance
   of organic tomato production.},

   spectrum for soils of medium texture},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},

Abstract = {Dielectric sensors are a popular choice for soil moisture determination.
   However, the output of many of these devices, especially those operating
   at frequencies in the MHz range, can be significantly affected by the
   influence of soil salinity and texture. The aim of this paper is to
   examine the impact of salinity, texture and measurement frequency on
   dielectric permittivity - soil moisture calibration curves for ten soils
   of medium texture in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 3 GHz based on
   the complex dielectric permittivity spectra measured with the use of a
   coaxial transmission line cell connected to a vector-network-analyzer.
   The use of laboratory-measured spectra ensures that at all frequencies
   dielectric permittivity is measured at the same conditions with no
   influence of factors such as different sensitivity zone or various
   installation conditions, as in the case of comparing individual sensors
   operating at various frequencies. The obtained relations were comparable
   to the calibration curves of several capacitance/impedance sensors
   operating at corresponding frequencies. Calibration curves for apparent
   permittivity, which were obtained with the use of simulations in the
   time domain based on the measured spectra, were also determined for the
   tested soils. Even though the tested soils did not include soils with
   high clay content, the impact of soil texture on the calibration curves
   was observed. Results confirmed that the influence of soil salinity and
   texture on dielectric permittivity was the most significant in the lower
   part of the frequency spectrum, while the smallest impact of these
   factors was observed at frequencies of several hundred MHz and above.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Long-term use of organic and inorganic fertilizers can have a negative
   impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient stoichiometry in
   paddy soil. However, production of sufficient crops to meet food and
   feed demands globally requires the use of fertilizer in crop production.
   In the present study, we assessed the environmental impacts of five
   fertilizer treatments in a rice-rice-fallow cropping system: no
   fertilizer (CK); inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
   fertilizers (NPK); manure (M); inorganic phosphorus and potassium
   fertilizers with manure (PKM); and inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and
   potassium fertilizers with manure (NPKM). Soil parameters were analyzed
   to examine the relationships between GHG emissions, net ecosystem carbon
   budgets (NECBs), and soil nutrient stoichiometric ratios. Both the PKM
   and NPKM treatments increased grain yield and the soil carbon-nitrogen
   (C:N), carbon-phosphorus (C:P), and nitrogen-phosphorus (N:P) ratios
   compared to the CK treatment; they also decreased the nitrogen-potassium
   (N:K) ratio. In the combined fertilization treatments, the fallow season
   accounted for 9-13\% of annual methane (CH4) emissions, whereas early
   rice accounted for 55-62 \% and late rice contributed 38-45 \%. Compared
   to the CK, PKM and NPKM fertilization increased the annual nitrous oxide
   (N2O) emissions by 52-73 \% and 103-115 \%, respectively, in both the
   rice and fallow seasons. In early rice, the C:P ratio and GHG intensity
   (GHGI) were negatively correlated with CH4 and N2O emissions, whereas
   both yield and CH4 emissions had strong positive associations with
   global warming potential (GWP). In the late rice season, GHGI was
   negatively correlated with carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 emissions, and
   N2O had strong positive associations with GWP. CO2 and N2O emission
   levels were greater from late rice than from early rice, although CH4
   emissions from early rice contributed more to the annual GWP, resulting
   in higher carbon equivalent emissions but a lower carbon efficiency
   ratio in early rice output. A Technique for Order of Preference by
   Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) optimization analysis suggested
   that PKM was the best fertilization method to improve yield while
   minimizing negative environmental impacts, followed in descending order
   by the NPKM, NPK, and M treatments.},

Abstract = {Long-term large inputs of phosphorus (P) fertilizer in China have caused
   serious soil P accumulation, low P use efficiency (PUE) and high risk of
   P loss. Controlling the amount of P fertilizer applied presents an
   inevitable choice for improving the PUE. Struvite recycled from
   agricultural wastewater rich in N and P concentrations are capable of
   slow nutrient release, improving nutrient uptake and enabling the reuse
   of nutrients from environmental sources when applied to agricultural
   land. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the
   effects of struvite combined with P reduction under a rice-wheat
   rotation system in eastern China. A total of five treatments were set
   up, including conventional fertilization (FP), a struvite substitution
   of 100\% P fertilizer (SP), a 50\% P reduction with struvite
   substitution (RSP), no application of N fertilizer (N0) and no
   application of P fertilizer (P0). Grain yield, crop N and P uptake, N
   and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE) and soil nutrient status were
   assessed. Under the same P application rate, the yield and aboveground
   biomass of the SP treatment were slightly higher than those of FP
   treatment, but the crop P uptake, PUE and soil available P content were
   significantly increased. The RSP treatment did not reduce yield with
   50\% P reduction, and significantly improved the PUE and soil available
   P content. Crop N uptake and NUE were also found to be increased in SP
   and RSP treatments with struvite substitution. The P apparent balance
   showed that both the SP and FP treatments had a P surplus, but the RSP
   treatment had a P break-even, and the soil available P content remains
   stable compared with the initial value. The results indicate that
   struvite application could improve the soil P availability and crop
   nutrient uptake then promote the crop yield. To increase the nutrient
   use efficiency of crops while ensuring crop yield and soil fertility,
   appropriate P reduction combined with struvite as a P fertilizer could
   be sustainable in the rice-wheat rotation system in the long run.},

   strip mulching in the dryland wheat (<i>Triticum</i> <i>aestivum </i>L.)
   cropping system of Northwest China},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Surface mulching is an effective strategy to increase yields in rainfed
   agroecosystems. The plastic film residue and overuse of chemical
   fertilizer cause a serious non-point source pollution and high
   production input cost. With mulching, farmers typically attempt to
   maintain the balance of soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer use while
   ensuring high yields. Straw strip mulching (SM) is a new mulching
   technique, but the effects on nutrient uptake have not been studied yet.
   Therefore, 19 field comparative experiments were conducted in four
   growth seasons of winter wheat with three mulching treatments: (1) straw
   strip mulch (SM), a partial ground mulching using whole corn stalks that
   alternate with planting strips without mulch; (2) full-field plastic
   film mulching (PM); and (3) no mulching with wheat sown in rows, as a
   control (CK). Compared with CK, on average over all experiments, SM
   increased grain yield by 11.5\%, biomass by 19.0\%, the total
   aboveground uptakes of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by
   16.1\%, 18.4\% and 22.9\%. There were no significant differences between
   SM and CK in N and P requirements, the N, P and K concentrations in
   grain. The increased total aboveground uptake of each nutrient was
   closely associated with higher biomass, grain yield and straw yield (r =
   0.66-0.84, P < 0.01). Relative to CK, SM significantly decreased the
   total accumulation of residual NO3-N in the top 100 cm at maturity stage
   by 32.3\% (22.7 kg ha(-1)) in typical fertilization (N, 120 kg ha(-1);
   P2O5, 90 kg ha(-1)) and by 33.8\% (45.8 kg ha(-1)) in high fertilization
   (N, 150 kg ha(-1); P2O5, 120 kg ha(-1)), and the leaching of NO3-N into
   the deep soil below 40 cm. When only grain nutrients exported from the
   field after harvest in typical fertilization, N balance in SM, PM and CK
   accounted for 43.8\%, 38.5\% and 48.6\% of N input, while P balance for
   74.8\%, 74.0\% and 78.4\% of P input, respectively, indicating possible
   saving potentials in fertilizer costs for all treatment, but the saving
   potential of P is much greater than that of N. Relative to PM, SM had
   similar the total aboveground nutrients uptake, similar to or slightly
   less grain yields, and higher economic benefit. SM is suitable for
   popularizing in a semiarid rainfed agroecosystem.},

Abstract = {The tree-based farming system is one of the finest options for crop
   diversification, ecological stabilisation and economic upliftment in the
   Indian Himalayan regions. Keeping this scenario in mind, an on-field
   experiment was conducted to assess the effect of Populus deltoides
   `G-48' tree spacings (S1:6 m x 4 m, S2:4 m x 4 m) with open-field
   condition (S0) and different nutrient sources {[}T1:Control; T2:100\%
   RDN (recommended dose of nitrogen); T3:75\% RDN + 25\% FYM (farmyard

   T7:100\% Vermicompost); T8:Jeevamrut (10\%), each replicated thrice] on
   agronomic performance of Curcuma longa at Solan, India during 2019-2021.
   The results revealed that C. longa grown under tree spacing S1 coupled
   with the application of T3 treatment showed marked enhancement in
   growth, quality attributes of C. longa and post-harvest soil nutrient
   status whereas, yield attributes were better in S0. The yield of C.
   longa was curtailed by 22.5 and 31.6\%, whereas curcumin content was
   enhanced by 13.4\% and 12.2\% under S1 and S2, respectively over S0. The
   vegetation carbon density (66.38 Mg ha-1), total ecosystem carbon
   density (119.04 Mg ha-1), and total carbon sequestered (436.47 Mg ha-1)
   was found to be higher under S1, whereas soil carbon density (55.68 Mg
   ha-1) was maximum under S2 being at par with S1. Maximum net returns
   (14,693 US\$ ha-1 yr-1) were realised under S1 tree spacing and T3
   treatment. Overall, the study concluded that in P. deltoids-C. longa
   system, application of 75\% RDN + 25\% FYM at 6 m x 4 m spacing of
   poplar have demonstrated efficacy in getting a better quality of
   turmeric, maintaining soil fertility, and combating climate change.},

Title = {Using SMOS soil moisture data combining CO<sub>2</sub> flask samples to
   constrain carbon fluxes during 2010-2015 within a Carbon Cycle Data
   Assimilation System (CCDAS)},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2020},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The terrestrial carbon cycle is an important component of the global
   carbon budget due to its large gross exchange fluxes with the atmosphere
   and their sensitivity to climate change. Terrestrial biosphere models
   show large uncertainties in simulating carbon fluxes, which impact
   global carbon budget assessments. The land surface carbon cycle is
   tightly controlled by soil moisture through plant physiological
   processes. Accurate soil moisture observations thereby have the
   potential to improve the modeling of carbon fluxes in a model-data
   fusion framework. We employ the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System
   (CCDAS) to assimilate six years of surface soil moisture provided by the
   SMOS satellite in combination with global-scale observations of
   atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that assimilation of SMOS soil
   moisture exhibits better performance on soil hydrology modeling at both
   global and site-level than only assimilating atmospheric CO2
   concentrations, and it improves the soil moisture simulation
   particularly in mid- to high-latitude regions where the plants suffer
   from water stress frequently. The optimized model also shows good
   agreements with inter-annual variability in simulated Net Primary
   Productivity (NEP) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) from an
   atmospheric inversion (Jena CarboScope) and the up-scaled eddy
   covariance flux product (FLUXNET-MTE), respectively. Correlation between
   SIF (Solar Induced Fluorescence) and optimized GPP also shows to be the
   highest when soil moisture and atmospheric CO2 are simultaneously
   assimilated. In general, CCDAS obtains smaller annual mean NEP values
   (1.8 PgC/yr) than the atmospheric inversion and an ensemble of Dynamic
   Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), but larger GPP values (167.8 PgC/yr)
   than the up-scaled eddy covariance dataset (FLUXNET-MTE) and the MODIS
   based GPP product for the years 2010 to 2015. This study demonstrates
   the high potential of constraining simulations of the terrestrial
   biosphere carbon cycle on inter-annual time scales using long-term
   microwave observations of soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Long-range weather forecasts provide predictions of atmospheric, ocean
   and land surface conditions that can potentially be used in land surface
   and hydrological models to predict the water and energy status of the
   land surface or in crop growth models to predict yield for water
   resources or agricultural planning. However, the coarse spatial and
   temporal resolutions of available forecast products have hindered their
   widespread use in such modelling applications, which usually require
   high-resolution input data. In this study, we applied sub-seasonal (up
   to 4 months) and seasonal (7 months) weather forecasts from the latest
   European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) seasonal
   forecasting system (SEAS5) in a land surface modelling approach using
   the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5). Simulations were conducted
   for 2017-2020 forced with sub-seasonal and seasonal weather forecasts
   over two different domains with contrasting climate and cropping
   conditions: the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (DE-NRW) and the
   Australian state of Victoria (AUS-VIC). We found that, after
   pre-processing of the forecast products (i.e. temporal downscaling of
   precipitation and incoming short-wave radiation), the simulations forced
   with seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts were able to provide a model
   output that was very close to the reference simulation results forced by
   reanalysis data (the mean annual crop yield showed maximum differences
   of 0.28 and 0.36 t ha(-1) for AUS-VIC and DE-NRW respectively).
   Differences between seasonal and sub-seasonal experiments were
   insignificant. The forecast experiments were able to satisfactorily
   capture recorded inter-annual variations of crop yield. In addition,
   they also reproduced the generally higher inter-annual differences in
   crop yield across the AUS-VIC domain (approximately 50\% inter-annual
   differences in recorded yields and up to 17\% inter-annual differences
   in simulated yields) compared to the DE-NRW domain (approximately 15\%
   inter-annual differences in recorded yields and up to 5\% in simulated
   yields). The high- and low-yield seasons (2020 and 2018) among the 4
   simulated years were clearly reproduced in the forecast simulation
   results. Furthermore, sub-seasonal and seasonal simulations reflected
   the early harvest in the drought year of 2018 in the DE-NRW domain.
   However, simulated inter-annual yield variability was lower in all
   simulations compared to the official statistics. While general soil
   moisture trends, such as the European drought in 2018, were captured by
   the seasonal experiments, we found systematic overestimations and
   underestimations in both the forecast and reference simulations compared
   to the Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 soil moisture product (SMAP
   L3) and the Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative Combined dataset
   from the European Space Agency (ESA CCI). These observed biases of soil
   moisture and the low inter-annual differences in simulated crop yield
   indicate the need to improve the representation of these variables in
   CLM5 to increase the model sensitivity to drought stress and other crop
   stressors.},

Title = {Estimation of Groundwater Recharge in a Volcanic Aquifer System Using

   Gilgel Gibe Catchment, Ethiopia},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Understanding the recharge-discharge system of a catchment is key to the
   efficient use and effective management of groundwater resources. The
   present study focused on the estimation of groundwater recharge using
   Soil Moisture Balance (SMB) and Baseflow Separation (BFS) methods in the
   Gilgel Gibe catchment where water demand for irrigation, domestic, and
   industrial purposes is dramatically increasing. The demand for
   groundwater and the existing ambitious plans to respond to this demand
   will put a strain on the groundwater resource in the catchment unless
   prompt intervention is undertaken to ensure its sustainability.
   Ground-based hydrometeorological 36-years data (1985 to 2020) from 17
   stations and satellite products from CHIRPS and NASA/POWER were used for
   the SMB method. Six BFS methods were applied through the Web-based
   Hydrograph Analysis Tool (WHAT), SepHydro, BFLOW, and Automated Computer
   Programming (PART) to sub-catchments and the main catchment to estimate
   the groundwater recharge. The streamflow data (discharge) obtained from
   the Ministry of Water and Energy were the main input data for the BFS
   methods. The average annual recharge of groundwater was estimated to be
   313 mm using SMB for the years 1985 to 2020 and 314 mm using BFS for the
   years 1986 to 2003. The results from the SMB method revealed
   geographical heterogeneity in annual groundwater recharge, varying from
   209 to 442 mm. Significant spatial variation is also observed in the
   estimated annual groundwater recharge using the BFS methods, which
   varies from 181 to 411 mm for sub-catchments. Hydrogeological conditions
   of the catchment were observed, and the yielding capacity of existing
   wells was assessed to evaluate the validity of the results. The recharge
   values estimated using SMB and BFS methods are comparable and
   hydrologically reasonable. The findings remarkably provide insightful
   information for decision-makers to develop effective groundwater
   management strategies and to prioritize the sub-catchments for immediate
   intervention to ensure the sustainability of groundwater.},

   increased sharply as N rates rose, but soil moisture storage decreased.
   Summer maize under the high N treatment suffered from increased NR
   levels and low soil water at the vegetative stage. The dry matter levels
   increased as the N supply rose during the wheat season. When the N
   application rate was below 210 and 172 kg N ha(-1)for wheat and maize,
   respectively, yield increased as the N application rose, but excessive N
   applications negatively affected maize and wheat grain yields. NUE
   decreased significantly as time progressed and N rates increased. The
   most appropriate N rates were 172 kg N ha(-1)for maize and 210 kg N
   ha(-1)for wheat, which led to relatively good soil moisture uptake and

Abstract = {Rain gauges are unevenly spaced around the world with extremely low
   gauge density over developing countries. For instance, in some regions
   in Africa the gauge density is often less than one station per 10 000
   km(2). The availability of rainfall data provided by gauges is also not
   always guaranteed in near real time or with a timeliness suited for
   agricultural and water resource management applications, as gauges are
   also subject to malfunctions and regulations imposed by national
   authorities. A potential alternative is satellite-based rainfall
   estimates, yet comparisons with in situ data suggest they are often not
   optimal.
   In this study, we developed a short-latency (i.e. 2-3 d) rainfall
   product derived from the combination of the Integrated Multi-Satellite
   Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) Early Run
   (IMERG-ER) with multiplesatellite soil-moisture-based rainfall products
   derived from ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer), SMOS (Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) L3 (Level 3)
   satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals. We tested the performance of
   this product over four regions characterized by high-quality
   ground-based rainfall datasets (India, the conterminous United States,
   Australia and Europe) and over data-scarce regions in Africa and South
   America by using triple-collocation (TC) analysis. We found that the
   integration of satellite SM observations with in situ rainfall
   observations is very beneficial with improvements of IMERG-ER up to 20\%
   and 40\% in terms of correlation and error, respectively, and a
   generalized enhancement in terms of categorical scores with the
   integrated product often outperforming reanalysis and ground-based
   long-latency datasets. We also found a relevant overestimation of the
   rainfall variability of GPM-based products (up to twice the reference
   value), which was significantly reduced after the integration with
   satellite soil-moisture-based rainfall estimates.
   Given the importance of a reliable and readily available rainfall
   product for water resource management and agricultural applications over
   data-scarce regions, the developed product can provide a valuable and
   unique source of rainfall information for these regions.},

Abstract = {Intensive agriculture relies mainly on the injudicious application of
   fertilizers. The importance of inherent soil fertility is often ignored
   owing to the complexity of the relationship between crop productivity
   and soil properties in the field with continuous fertilization. Here,
   our goal was to improve the understanding of long-term crop responses to
   soil nutrient availability. This study was one component of long-term
   nutrient management experiments conducted from 1993 to 2018. Field
   receiving standard fertilization before 2007 was divided into fertilized
   and non-fertilized plots. Fertilizer application was suspended in
   non-fertilized treatment since 2007 for 11 years, but control treatment
   continuously received standard fertilization (252-164-281 kg ha(-1)
   year(-1) of N-P-K) from 1993 to 2018. Crop biomass and N uptake
   decreased by 29-69\% and 28-76\% of standard fertilization in wheat and
   maize, respectively from 2008 to 2011, and then stabilized at 10-41\%
   and 31-73\% of standard fertilization in wheat and maize, respectively,
   from 2012 to 2018. Spatial analysis of crop growth and soil
   characteristics showed that grain yields of both species after cessation
   of fertilization were associated with total and available soil N (r =
   0.62-0.79). The large within-field yield variation (42-52\%) after 3
   years of suspended fertilization resulted from a slight (9\%) variation
   in soil N availability. Cessation of fertilizer affected vegetative
   growth of wheat and reproductive growth of maize and both species showed
   different determinants of the yield formation processes under low soil
   fertility.},

Abstract = {Traditional short-term diversification of annual crops for the purpose
   of improving soil fertility and food security is a common practice in
   Ethiopia. However, the best cropping systems have not been selected yet
   though field research. Experiments were conducted for two years with an
   objective of establishing sustained finger millet based short term
   cropping sequence in two major finger millet producing areas of
   Ethiopia. The experiments were laid out in a split-plot arrangement with
   six precursor crops (haricot bean, maize, sweet lupine, niger seed,
   wheat, and teff) as a main plot factor, where determined residues were
   retained in the main plot after harvesting and two nitrogen fertilizer
   levels (30 and 60 kg ha(-1)) applied for finger millet as sub-plots with
   three replications. Soil analysis result examined immediately after
   finger millet harvest showed a significant effect of precursor crops and
   nitrogen fertilizer rates on soil properties. Planting finger millet
   following lupine increased the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and
   cation exchange capacity by 17.37\%, 65.50\%, 26.15\%, respectively,
   over planting finger millet following teff. Use of different amount of
   nitrogen fertilizer likely contributed to observed differences in
   residual soil nutrients. Accordingly, finger millet following lupine
   with the addition of 60 kg ha(-1) nitrogen fertilizer gave significantly
   higher finger millet grain yield (3.24 tone ha(-1)) and relative
   production (22.37\%) and economic (40.7\%) efficiency. This system with
   their high sustainability and multiple benefits can be readily accepted
   by the farming community.},

Abstract = {Rhizosphere hypoxia severely inhibited plant growth, reducing the crop
   yield and water use efficiency (WUE) in greenhouse crops. Irrigation
   using nanobubbles (NBs) has been an efficient method to increase crop
   yield and WUE by ameliorating hypoxic conditions and promoting plant
   growth. However, the potential effects and mechanisms of different
   oxygen concentrations in water enriched in nanobubbles (NBW) remain
   unclear. Herein, this study examined the influence of different total
   oxygen concentrations (TOCs, ranged between 160 and 280 mg L-1) on
   tomato agronomic performance, soil fertility, and the bacterial
   community after a two-season of NBW irrigation. The results indicated
   that the tomato yield, WUE, soluble sugar, and vitamin C were
   significantly improved by NBs, showing the trends of rising to decrease
   with the corresponding oxygen concentration in irrigation water. The
   total C (TC), organic matter (OM), available N (AN) and K (AK) in soil
   tended to increase and then decrease with TOC in irrigation water. NB220
   obtained the highest soil OM and AN values, and NB250 obtained the
   highest TC and AK values. The soil bacterial community composition
   gradually differentiated with increasing oxygen concentration. There
   were significant differences in relative abundances of Proteobacteria
   and Nitrospirae across the six oxygen levels. The keystones in the
   co-occurrence network were dependent on oxygen levels. FAPROTAX results
   revealed that bacterial functions of methanol oxidation, N fixation,
   aerobic chemoheterotrophy, and cellulolysis were more abundant in NB220
   treated soils, consequently resulting in better crop yield, WUE, and
   soil fertility. Overall, the increased abundance of taxa participating
   in soil nutrient turnover contributed to improved soil fertility and
   crop agronomic performance. Our findings provided a significant
   opportunity to advance the understanding of oxygen threshold during
   aerated irrigation, with implications for green and efficient
   agricultural production.},

Abstract = {Long-term, high-resolution soil moisture (SM) is a vital variable for
   understanding the water-energy cycle and the impacts of climate change
   on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, most existing satellite SM
   data are only available at coarse scale (+/- 25 km) and suffer a lot
   from data gaps due to satellite orbit coverage and snow cover,
   especially on the QTP. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to
   downscale SM utilizing multiple soil moisture indices (SMIs) or diverse
   machine learning (ML) methods, the potentials of different SMIs and ML
   approaches in SM downscaling on the complex plateau remain unclear, and
   there is still a necessity to obtain an accurate, long-term,
   high-resolution and seamless SM data over the QTP. To address this
   issue, this study generated the long-term, high-accuracy and seamless
   soil moisture dataset (LHS-SM) over the QTP during 2001-2020 using a
   two-step downscaling method (first downscaling then merging). Firstly,
   the daily SM data from the Climate Change Initiative program of the
   European Space Agency (ESA CCI) was downscaled to 1 km utilizing five ML
   approaches. Then, a dynamic data merging method that considers
   spatiotemporal nonstationary error was applied to derive the final
   LHS-SM data. The performance of fifteen SMIs was also assessed and the
   optimal indexes for downscaling were identified. Results indicated that
   the shortwave infrared band-based indices had better performance than
   the near infrared band-based and energy-based indices. The generated
   LHS-SM data exhibited satisfying accuracy (mean R = 0.52, ubRMSE = 0.047
   m(3)/m(3)) and certain improvement to the ESA CCI SM data both at
   station and network scales. Compared with existing 1 km SM datasets, the
   LHS-SM data also showed the best performance (mean R = 0.62, ubRMSE =
   0.047 m(3)/m(3)), while existing datasets either failed to fully
   characterize the spatial details or had some data gaps and unreasonable
   distributions. Strong spatial heterogeneity was observed in the SM
   dynamics during 2001-2020 with the southwest and northeast showing a
   ``dry gets wetter{''} scheme and the southeast presenting a ``wet gets
   drier{''} trend. Overall, the LHS-SM dataset gained its added values by
   compensating the drawbacks of existing 1 km SM products over the QTP and
   was much valuable for many regional applications.},

Abstract = {Uneven soil moisture and nutrient distribution before and after
   intercropping limits apple cropping system productivity in the western
   Shanxi-Loess Plateau area. To address this issue, a field trial was
   conducted between 2020 and 2021 to study the effects of different water
   and fertilizer management practices on soil moisture, nutrients, and
   root distribution, as well as the overall effectiveness of the
   apple-maize and apple-soybean intercropping systems during crop
   replacement. The experiment involved two irrigation methods: drip (D)
   and flood (M) irrigation. Three irrigation levels included rain-fed
   without irrigation (W0), and 50\% (W1) and 80\% (W2) of field capacity
   (Fc). Three fertilizer treatments included no additional fertilizer
   application (F0), 375 kg center dot hm-2 (F1), and 750 kg center dot
   hm-2 (F2), in addition to a control (CK) without irrigation or
   fertilization. The soil water content (SWC) decreased after the crop
   replacement. Additionally, nitrate nitrogen (NN), ammonium nitrogen
   (AN), and organic matter (OM) content levels in all treatments
   increased, whereas total phosphorus (TP) content decreased. The soil
   layer with crop roots moved downward after crop replacement, and partial
   fertilizer productivity (PFP), irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE),
   and water use efficiency (WUE) were decreased under both irrigation
   treatments. Principal component analysis showed that the W2F2 treatment
   had the highest benefit from crop combination across both irrigation
   treatments during the crop replacement period. According to our results,
   to optimize the benefits of apple-crop intercropping, drip irrigation
   with complete water supply and flood irrigation with incomplete water
   supply are recommended during crop replacement. In addition, an upper
   irrigation limit of 80\% Fc with 750 kg center dot hm-2 fertilization is
   recommended for optimal water and fertilizer regulation.},

Abstract = {Estimation of soil moisture variables is very important in agriculture
   studies such as precision irrigation and its management, so knowledge of
   the variation would be highly beneficial. Effective irrigation is
   possible with regular monitoring of soil and plant water conditions and
   with the forecasting of future crop water requirement. This study
   explored the capability of indices for estimating soil moisture as an
   indicator of detection irrigation time in sugarcane farms located in the
   southwest of Iran. For this goal, Landsat 8 satellite images were got
   from May until September 2015. Concurrent with the satellite pass times,
   field measurements include soil moisture (SM) and canopy temperature was
   done at the predefined points in sugarcane farms. These farms were
   selected with different age and irrigation days. Various indices were
   calculated using the combination of optical and thermal infrared
   wavelengths, and their relationship to the amount of SM was studied.
   According to the results of this research, vegetation indices based on
   optical bands do not show a good coefficient of determination (R-2).
   Results showed that soil moisture computed by crop water stress index
   (CWSI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) have a similar
   trend, which showed that both indices can be used for irrigation
   scheduling, although they had some differences for computed soil
   moisture, TVDI had better correlation than to CWSI. TVDI indicated a
   good correlation with SM measurement data whichR(2)values range from
   0.35 to 0.66, as well as inharmonious with the spatial distribution of
   (SM). It showed (RMSE) less than 0.2. Comparing recorded irrigation and
   (SM) in the farms shows that (SM) can be classified into three classes:
   low soil moisture (0.1 < SM <= 0.15), medium soil moisture (0.15 < SM <=
   0.2) and high soil moisture (0.2 < SM <= 0.25). This classification can
   be utilized for precision irrigation scheduling in soils with heavy and
   semi-heavy texture (silty clay and silty clay loam). All of the results
   demonstrated that the TVDI can be utilized for assessment SM and
   determine irrigation time in agriculture lands, without each other in
   situ measurement of data.},

Abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a non-renewable source, requires in large amount for
   maintaining better crop growth and development. The excessive P
   fertilizer contributes to the accumulation of P in the soil and results
   in increased soil total P and Olsen P. However, the spatio-temporal
   variation of soil P remains unclear in pomelo orchard systems.
   Therefore, this study aimed to assess the temporal and spatial variation
   of soil P in pomelo orchards and future to predict P pool from 1985 to
   2100, based on the dynamic P pool simulator (DPPS) model. We found that
   an average of 282.23 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) accumulated in pomelo orchard
   soil, resulting in increased concentration of Olsen P (i.e., 5-212 mg
   kg(-1)) and total P (i.e., 80-1883 mg kg(-1)) in the topsoil. It showed
   that Olsen P and total P pools increased in topsoil about 42 and 25
   folds, respectively from 1985 to 2015. Soil P accumulation occurred not
   only in topsoil but also found in deeper soil horizon of pomelo orchard.
   Compared with the natural forest, the concentration of Olsen P and
   fractions (Al-P and Fe-P) in 20-year-old pomelo orchard increased
   significantly in soil depth of 0-120 cm, while Sol-P increased
   significantly in 0-60 cm soil depth. Scenario analyses from 1985 to 2100
   indicated that the P application rate at 31 kg P ha(-1) could maintain
   pomelo yield at its optimum level. These findings could provide the
   synthesized novel insight for understanding the soil P status and its
   sustainable management in the pomelo orchard systems.},

Abstract = {The excessive use of chemical phosphorus (P) fertilizer can lower grain
   yield and P use efficiency (PUE) by aggravating soil acidity.
   Substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer can alleviate the
   problem, although the long-term effect of organic manure incorporation
   is unknown. We conceptualized that substituting organic manure for
   chemical fertilizer may result in higher crop yields and PUE. Therefore,
   the impact of long-term fertilizer treatments: (i) CK (control), (ii) PK
   (phosphorus and potassium fertilizer), (iii) NP (nitrogen and P
   fertilizer), (iv) NK fertilizer, (v) NPK fertilizer, and (vi) NPKM (30\%
   NPK fertilizer plus 70\% manure) on rice yield, PUE, P uptake, and
   apparent balance (APB) was investigated. The results showed that rice
   yield under different fertilizer treatments ranged from 6.2 to 11.8 t
   ha(-1) (1984-1995), 7.9 to 12.7 t ha(-1) (1996-2007), and 6.6 to 12.8 t
   ha(-1) (2008-2018). The rice yield under NPKM was greatly improved
   compared to other treatments, except with that of NPK (1984-1995). Soil
   organic carbon (SOC), available P and phosphorus activation coefficient
   (PAC) under NPKM were significantly higher than other treatments during
   1984-2018. Soil pH (1984-2018) was greatly higher under CK and NPKM than
   under other treatments. Soil total P under PK, NP, NPK, and NPKM was
   significantly higher than under CK and NK (1984-2018). Compared to other
   treatments, P uptake was significantly higher under NPKM, except with
   that of NPK (1984-1995 and 2008-2018). The average PUE (1984-2018) was
   10.7, 20.2, 36.1, and 44.2 kg kg(-1) under PK, NP, NPK, and NPKM,
   respectively. The APB under NPKM was significantly lower as compared to
   PK, NP, and NPK treatments. Therefore, we conclude that in addition to
   improving soil organic carbon, cations inputs from organic manure can be
   a factor for the increase in soil pH, making organic manure substitution
   for chemical fertilizer a more efficient strategy for increasing PUE and
   crop yield.},

Abstract = {Excessive nitrogen (N) fertilization, low use efficiency, and heavy
   pollution are the dominant issues that exist in intensively cultivated
   double rice cropping systems in China. Two-year field and N-15
   microregion experiments were conducted to evaluate the N fate in a
   soil-rice system under a series of different N rate treatments from 2020
   to 2021. The economic N application rate that simultaneously improved
   rice yield and N use efficiency in the rotation system was also
   investigated. Results demonstrated that soil residues and mineralized N
   accounted for more than 58.0\% and 53.2\% of the total N input in the
   early and late rice seasons, respectively. Similarly, most of the total
   N input was absorbed by rice, ranging from 43.7\% to 55.6\% in early
   rice and from 36.8\% to 54.7\% in late rice. Rice N use efficiency
   significantly decreased with increasing N application, while rice grain
   yield and its N uptake increased when the N application rate was below
   150 kg ha(-1) in early rice and 200 kg ha(-1) in late rice. Exceeding
   this point limited rice N uptake and yield formation. The apparent N
   recovery rate, N residual rate, and N loss rate were 23.5-34.4\%,
   17.0-47.1\%, and 26.0-47.8\% for the early rice, and 32.8-37.3\%,
   74.2-87.0\%, and 71.5-92.1\% for the late rice. The linear plateau
   analysis further indicated that the recommended N application rate
   (118.5-152.8 kg ha(-1) for early rice and 169.9-186.2 kg ha(-1) for late
   rice) can not only maintain a relatively higher rice yield and N
   utilization but also significantly reduce soil N residue. Our results
   provide theoretical guidance for improving N management in
   double-cropping rice fields in southern China.},

Title = {Effect of different planting pattern arrangements on soil organic matter
   and soil nitrogen content under a maize/soybean strip relay
   intercropping system},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Assessing the spatial distribution of organic matter and total nitrogen
   in soil is essential for management and optimum utilization of
   fertilizers. Therefore, the present field experiment was conducted to
   evaluate the impact of different planting pattern arrangements on the
   spatial distribution of soil total nitrogen and organic matter content
   under a maize/soybean strip relay intercropping system. The planting was
   arranged in a manner such that soil sampling could be done from
   continuous maize/soybean relay strip intercropping (MS1), maize/soybean
   relay strip intercropping in rotation (MS2), traditional maize/soybean
   intercropping (MS3), sole maize (M), sole soybean (S), and fallow land
   (FL) from 2018 to 2020. The results showed significant variations for
   soil organic matter and total nitrogen content under different planting
   pattern arrangements of maize and soybean in the strip relay
   intercropping system. Across all systems, the highest soil organic
   matter (29.19 g/kg) and total nitrogen (10.19 g/kg) were recorded in
   MS2. In contrast, the lowest soil organic matter (1.69 g/kg) and total
   nitrogen (0.64 g/kg) were observed in FL. Soil organic matter and total
   nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when
   compared with FL. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen in MS2
   increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when compared with FL.
   Furthermore, under MS2, the spatial distribution of soil organic matter
   was higher in both maize and soybean crop rows as compared with other
   cropping patterns, whereas the soil total nitrogen was higher under
   soybean rows as compared with maize in all other treatment. However,
   correlation analysis of the treatments showed variations in organic
   matter content. It can be concluded that different planting patterns can
   have varying effects on soil organic matter and total nitrogen
   distribution under the strip relay intercropping system. Moreover, it is
   recommended from this study that MS2 is a better planting pattern for
   the strip relay intercropping system, which can increase the spatial
   distribution of soil organic matter and total nitrogen, thereby
   improving soil fertility, C:N ratio, and crop production. This study
   will serve as a foundation towards the scientific usage of chemical
   fertilizers in agricultural sector.},

Abstract = {Microbial diversities in the vicinity of root rhizosphere play a crucial
   role in promoting plant and soil ecosystem health and productivity. They
   have great potential as key indicators of soil health in agro-ecosystems
   enhancing the availability of nutrients. Therefore, a study was carried
   out during 2019-20 and 2020-21 at research farm of Chaudhary Charan
   Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, Haryana to investigate the
   rhizospheric microbial diversities under cotton (Gossypium spp.)-wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system as affected by land configuration
   and nutrient management. Experiment consisted of 5 nutrient treatments
   replicated thrice and two land configurations, viz. raised bed (RB) and
   flatbed (FB) planned in factorial randomized block design (RBD). The
   results of experiment under RB revealed that farmyard manure (FYM) and
   FYM with biofertilizer and cow urine formulation (FYM + Org) showed the
   highest bacterial, fungal, phosphate solubilizing bacteria, azotobacter
   and actinomycetes population (6.92 to 7.51, 24.63 to 26.80, 7.61 to
   7.68, 8.74 to 9.15,7.27 to 7.66 cfu/g soil, respectively). The decrease
   in microbial diversity was observed under inorganic fertilizer
   application through soil test crop response approach with targeted yield
   of 5.5 and 2.8 mg/ha (STCR5.5/2.8) and 6.0 and 3.2 mg/ha (STCR6.0/3.2)
   and control for cotton and wheat, respectively. Higher microbial
   population and soil organic carbon was found in RB compared to FB. The
   STCR5.5/2.8 and STCR6.0/3.2 recorded highest cotton and wheat yield
   followed by FYM and FYM+Org and least in control under cotton-wheat
   system. Thus, the study suggests that RB planting with an addition of
   manures along with biofertilizer and cow urine formulation could be a
   sustainable and feasible practice through enhanced microbial population
   raising soil fertility leading to increase the crop yields under
   semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {Citrus plants rely heavily on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) due to
   their lack of root hairs. Most experiments have been conducted with AMF
   inoculation under potted conditions, while field inoculation of AMF on
   citrus, especially a high economic hybrid tangor variety Beni-Madonna
   (Citrus nanko x C. amakusa), has been rarely recorded. This study aimed
   to analyze the effects of two AMF inoculations (a single Funneliformis
   mosseae and a mixture of F. mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, and
   Rhizophagus intraradices) on the internal and external fruit quality,
   leaf antioxidant defense system, and soil fertility and structure of
   top-worked Beni-Madonna tangor citrus trees. Three and a half years
   after AMF inoculations, soil hyphal length and root mycorrhizal
   colonization rate increased by 61.2-101.8\% and 15.85-29.6\% in
   inoculated plants, respectively. Inoculated trees had higher external
   fruit coloration value, fruit horizontal diameter, and fruit weight, and
   lower fruit rigidity than uninoculated trees. AMF-inoculated trees had
   higher glucose levels of fruit peels, fructose and sucrose levels of
   fruit fleshes, and the ratio of fruit soluble solids/titratable acids,
   as well as lower titratable acids concentrations than non-AMF-inoculated
   trees. AMF inoculation significantly increased leaf nitrogen balance
   index, chlorophyll index, peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase,
   and glutathione reductase activities, as well as reduced glutathione and
   oxidized glutathione concentrations, resulting in lower hydrogen
   peroxide and malondialdehyde levels when compared to the uninoculated
   treatment. In addition, inoculated trees presented higher soil nutrient
   levels, including organic carbon, available K, and Olsen-P as, well as
   soil aggregate stability (based on mean weight diameter) than
   uninoculated trees. This study concluded that field AMF inoculation
   improved fruit quality, enhanced leaf antioxidant defense system, and
   improved soil fertility of Beni-Madonna trees, with mixed AMF being
   prominent in improving fruit quality and F. mosseae being prominent in
   enhancing leaf antioxidant defense system and improving soil fertility.},

Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {The growing interest in low-frequency SAR for soil parameter retrieval
   has led to the development of new active L-band satellites, that will
   provide novel surface soil moisture products and retrieval
   possibilities; however, due to data unavailability so far, limited
   applications have investigated the use of change detection models using
   L-band satellite SAR data. Since July 2020, high revisit time,
   high-resolution acquisitions by the Satelite Argentino de Observacion
   COn Microondas (SAOCOM) Argentinian-Italian constellation have become
   accessible over Europe. Therefore, this research presents an
   investigation of the potential of multi-temporal L-band SAOCOM-1 for
   monitoring soil moisture variations underneath low and sparse
   agricultural vegetation. Moreover, it proposes a procedure for the
   mitigation of roughness contribution, by exploiting the entropy
   parameter derived from the dual-polarimetric decomposition. L-band
   sensitivity to soil moisture has been jointly evaluated in respect of
   Sentinel-1 C-band data by (1) comparing the temporal profiles of the
   backscattering coefficient, gamma(0), at VV and VH polarization, with
   the support of decomposition parameters (entropy and alpha), NDVI and
   precipitation data; (2) regression analysis with in situ soil moisture
   measurements, obtained by the REMEDHUS network in the Douro River basin
   (Spain); 3) evaluating the soil moisture retrievals obtained at C- and
   L- band using a change detection method. Finally, the effectiveness of
   the roughness normalization procedure for SAOCOM data has been validated
   using in situ data. L-band co-polarized gamma(0) has proved to be the
   best configuration for soil moisture inversion, being relatively
   insensitive to vegetation, as demonstrated by decomposition results and
   trend interpretation. Overall, regressions detected an R-2 22\% higher
   at L-band than C-band, with values up to 0.74 for VV ((R) over bar
   (2)=0.32) and up to 0.47 for the VH band ((R) over bar (2)=0.14).
   Co-polarized data obtained R-2 on average 62.1\% and 74.7\% higher for
   SAOCOM and Sentinel-1. The retrieval models show an ubRMSD of 7.1\% for
   SAOCOM data and 8.3\% for Sentinel-1. The application of the proposed
   roughness normalization procedure to SAOCOM led to an ubRMSD of 6.7\%
   improving the retrieved soil moisture trend by 7.9\%. This exploratory
   analysis demonstrated SAOCOM data potential for soil moisture mapping
   and would serve as a foundation for more advanced retrieval procedures.},

Abstract = {Most current optical/thermal-based surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval
   methods only utilize the instantaneous measurements made by onboard
   polar-orbit satellites, and they require soil texture as prior knowledge
   to obtain the volumetric SSM content. A recent study developed a diurnal
   land surface temperature (LST)-based SSM retrieval method to directly
   estimate the volumetric SSM content without the knowledge of soil
   texture. However, most subsequent studies have only examined the use of
   this method on bare soils. Therefore, the present study aims to
   investigate the feasibility of the method over vegetated regions with
   both experimental data and satellite observations. First, the impacts of
   vegetation on SSM retrieval were investigated through physics-based
   Common Land Model simulations and high accuracy with an overall root
   mean square error (RMSE) of 0.010 m(3)m(-3) was achieved when the
   underlying surface was covered by moderate fractional vegetation cover
   from 0 to 0.6 with a given soil texture. Based on the simulated results,
   the SSM was then estimated using data from an AmeriFlux site dominated
   by crops during the growing season in 2018; the results were further
   verified using in situ measurements, and this showed that the estimated
   SSM correlated well with in-situ measurements (with an RMSE of 0.078
   m(3)m(-3)). A further evaluation of the Meteosat Second Generation
   (MSG)-derived SSM at the pixel scale was made using the proposed method,
   and the results revealed an overall acceptable accuracy (RMSE of 0.074
   m(3)m(-3) and bias of 0.071 m(3)m(-3)) against the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SSM
   product at the same spatial resolution of 3 km.},

Abstract = {The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region has experienced more
   frequent and severe drought events in recent decades, leading to
   increasingly pressing concerns over already strained food and water
   security. An effective drought monitoring and early warning system is
   thus critical to support risk mitigation and management by countries in
   the region. Here we investigate the potential for assimilation of leaf
   area index (LAI) and soil moisture observations to improve the
   representation of the overall hydrological and carbon cycles and drought
   by an advanced land surface model. The results reveal that assimilating
   soil moisture does not meaningfully improve model representation of the
   hydrological and biospheric processes for this region, but instead it
   degrades the simulation of the interannual variation in
   evapotranspiration (ET) and carbon fluxes, mainly due to model
   weaknesses in representing prognostic phenology. However, assimilating
   LAI leads to greater improvement, especially for transpiration and
   carbon fluxes, by constraining the timing of simulated vegetation growth
   response to evolving climate conditions. LAI assimilation also helps to
   correct for the erroneous interaction between the prognostic phenology
   and irrigation during summertime, effectively reducing a large positive
   bias in ET and carbon fluxes. Independently assimilating LAI or soil
   moisture alters the categorization of drought, with the differences
   being greater for more severe drought categories. We highlight the
   vegetation representation in response to changing land use and
   hydroclimate as one of the key processes to be captured for building a
   successful drought early warning system for the MENA region.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion can affect the nature and distribution of soil carbon and
   nutrients, directly and indirectly influencing microbially facilitated
   processes of mineralization, ammoniation, and nitrification, thus
   affecting soil nutrients cycling. However, little is known about how
   soil erosion affects soil microorganisms. Since 2012, we conducted a
   modified soil erosion simulation experiment of topsoil removal method in
   an agricultural field to simulate erosion depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, and
   40 cm versus a control (0 cm). The results showed that Proteobacteria,
   Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and
   Firmicutes were the dominant soil microbial (here: Bacteria and Archaea)
   phyla, and Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter,
   and Actinospica were the dominant genera in all samples. The relative
   abundance of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria,
   Planctomycetes, Thaumarchaeota, Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter,
   Acidibacter, Bryobacter, Actinospica, and Rhodanobacter decreased with
   the increase of erosion depths, while Chloroflexi and Firmicutes
   increased with the increase of erosion depths. Soil microbial community
   structure was altered significantly at 30- and 40-cm soil erosion depth
   in comparison to control. Soil nutrient variability caused by soil
   erosion had a greater impact on soil microbial community composition
   than that of soil mechanical composition. Soil erosion indirectly
   affected microbial community composition through negative effects on
   soil available potassium, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and sand
   content. We thus highlight the importance of soil nutrients monitoring
   in different soil erosion levels to make the proper ecological
   restoration strategies to improve soil environment which soil
   microorganisms depend on.},

Title = {Nitrogen and rice straw incorporation impact nitrogen use efficiency,

Abstract = {The long-term sustainability of rice-wheat system (RWS) requires robust
   interventions such as recycling of rice straw (RS) to improve soil
   health and minimal impact on environment. Therefore, the dynamic
   adjustments in fertilizer-N application with RS incorporation that
   impacts crop productivity, N availability, N use efficiency (NUE) and
   soil enzymatic activity are required. We investigated the long-term
   impacts of four rates of RS incorporation (0, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 Mg
   ha(-1) year(-1); RS0, RS5.0, RS7.5 and RS10.0) and four rates of
   fertilizer-N (0, 90, 120 and 150 kg N ha(-1); N-0, N-90, N-120 and
   N-150) application in different combinations on N dynamics in soils,
   enzyme activity, crop yields and NUE. Results revealed that fertilizer-N
   application significantly (p<0.05) increased the grain yield, NUE and
   soil N pools in response to increasing RS incorporation rates.
   Fertilizer-N application combined with RS rates (RS5.0-RS7.5) resulted
   in a significantly higher mineral-N (NH4+-N + NO3--N) concentration
   compared with no-straw and no-N application (N-0 RS0), which decreased
   with increased soil depth. The combined application of fertilizer-N and
   RS incorporation significantly increased soils' enzymatic activity
   (urease and L-asparaginase) and glomalin related soil protein (TG). The
   crop (rice and wheat) yields (grain and straw) were significantly higher
   with fertilizer-N application of 120 kg N ha(-1) along with RS
   incorporation of 7.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (N-120 RS7.5). The physiological
   efficiency of N (PEN) was significantly improved with fertilizer-N
   application and RS incorporation from 35.6 to 73.2 kg N kg(-1) in rice
   and 35.7-64.9 kg N kg(-1) in wheat. The reciprocal internal use
   efficiency of N (RIUEN) ranged from 14.8 to 19.5 kg Mg(-1)in rice and
   from 17.5 to 21.5 kg Mg-1 in wheat. Average net returns and the
   benefit-cost ratio for rice and wheat were significantly increased with
   N-120 RS7.5, compared with N-90 RS7.5 treatment. The higher rate of
   fertilizer-N application at similar RS incorporation rate (N-150 RS7.5)
   did not result in significant change in crop yields and economic
   indices, compared with N-120 RS7.5. Therefore, application of 120 kg N
   ha(-1) is the optimum rate with RS incorporation at 7.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1)
   for increased productivity, NUE and economic returns, while avoiding
   environmental implications associated to open field straw burning in
   north-western India.},

Abstract = {IntroductionGreater amounts of fertilizer are applied every year to meet
   the growing demand for food. Sugarcane is one of the important food
   sources for human beings. MethodsHere, we evaluated the effects of a
   sugarcane-Dictyophora indusiata (DI) intercropping system on soil health
   by conducting an experiment with three different treatments: (1) bagasse
   application (BAS process), (2) bagasse + DI (DIS process), and (3) the
   control (CK). We then analyzed soil chemistry, the diversity of soil
   bacteria and fungi, and the composition of metabolites to clarify the
   mechanism underlying the effects of this intercropping system on soil
   properties. Results and discussionSoil chemistry analyses revealed that
   the content of several soil nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and
   phosphorus (P) was higher in the BAS process than in the CK. In the DIS
   process, a large amount of soil P was consumed by DI. At the same time,
   the urease activity was inhibited, thus slowing down the loss of soil in
   the DI process, while the activity of other enzymes such as
   beta-glucosidase and laccase was increased. It was also noticed that the
   content of lanthanum and calcium was higher in the BAS process than in
   the other treatments, and DI did not significantly alter the
   concentrations of these soil metal ions. Bacterial diversity was higher
   in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and fungal diversity
   was lower in the DIS process than in the other treatments. The soil
   metabolome analysis revealed that the abundance of carbohydrate
   metabolites was significantly lower in the BAS process than in the CK
   and the DIS process. The abundance of D(+)-talose was correlated with
   the content of soil nutrients. Path analysis revealed that the content
   of soil nutrients in the DIS process was mainly affected by fungi,
   bacteria, the soil metabolome, and soil enzyme activity. Our findings
   indicate that the sugarcane-DIS intercropping system can enhance soil
   health.},

Title = {Soil nitrogen availability and microbial carbon use efficiency are
   dependent more on chemical fertilization than winter drought in a
   maize-soybean rotation system},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {MAR 14},
Abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) availability is one of the limiting factors of crop
   productivity, and it is strongly influenced by global change and
   agricultural management practices. However, very few studies have
   assessed how the winter drought affected soil N availability during the
   subsequent growing season under chemical fertilization. We conducted a
   field investigation involving snow removal to simulate winter drought
   conditions in a Mollisol cropland in Northeast China as part of a 6-year
   fertilization experiment, and we examined soil physicochemical
   properties, microbial characteristics, and N availability. Our results
   demonstrated that chemical fertilization significantly increased soil
   ammonium and total N availability by 42.9 and 90.3\%, respectively; a
   combined winter drought and fertilization treatment exhibited the
   highest soil N availability at the end of the growing season. As the
   growing season continued, the variation in soil N availability was
   explained more by fertilization than by winter drought. The Mantel test
   further indicated that soil Olsen-P content and microbial carbon use
   efficiency (CUE) were significantly related to soil ammonium
   availability. A microbial community structure explained the largest
   fraction of the variation in soil nitrate availability. Microbial CUE
   showed the strongest correlation with soil N availability, followed by
   soil available C:P and bacteria:fungi ratios under winter drought and
   chemical fertilization conditions. Overall, we clarified that, despite
   the weak effect of the winter drought on soil N availability, it cannot
   be ignored. Our study also identified the important role of soil
   microorganisms in soil N transformations, even in seasonally
   snow-covered northern croplands.},

Title = {Supplementing Nitrogen in Combination with Rhizobium Inoculation and
   Soil Mulch in Peanut (<i>Arachis hypogaea</i> L.) Production System:
   Part I. Effects on Productivity, Soil Moisture, and Nutrient Dynamics},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea L.) are the world's fourth-most important
   source of edible oil and the third-most valuable source of high-quality
   vegetable protein; they also contain carbohydrates, fatty acids,
   vitamins, and minerals essential for good human nutrition. Peanuts area
   particularly valuable crop in tropical and subtropical regions. While
   the demand for peanuts is increasing globally, there is a significant
   gap in nitrogen supply and demand in peanut production systems. To
   alleviate this, nitrogen fertilizers are often applied indiscriminately;
   this practice leads to the deterioration of indigenous soil fertility
   and to a long-term decline in crop productivity. Considering these
   aspects of soil health, a field study was conducted over two consecutive
   winter (November-March) seasons in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 at the
   research farm of the agricultural university Bidhan Chandra Krishi
   Viswavidyalaya in West Bengal, India. This study examined supplementing
   different levels of nitrogen fertilizer with rhizobium and soil mulch in
   an irrigated peanut crop. The effects of these management interventions
   were evaluated in terms of crop productivity, nutrient dynamics, soil
   moisture, and the soil microbial activity. Peanuts grown with the 100\%
   recommended dose of nitrogen, which was applied with rhizobium and grown
   under polythene mulching, recorded the highest average pod yield (3.87
   and 3.96 t ha(-1) in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017) and average kernel yield
   (2.88 and 2.99 t ha(-1)) in both growing seasons. This treatment also
   resulted in the greatest accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorous, and
   potassium by the peanut plants. In contrast, the maximum soil moisture
   distribution and the greatest total root zone moisture content were
   observed in the treatment with only rhizobium under the polythene mulch
   (i.e., no nitrogen was applied). The populations of soil bacteria and
   rhizobia were highest in the treatment where nitrogen fertilizer was
   applied to the crop at 75\% of the recommended rate combined with
   rhizobium and under polythene mulch. After two cropping seasons, the
   peanut crop grown under polythene mulch with rhizobium and with nitrogen
   fertilizer applied at either the full recommended rate or 75\% of this
   rate performed best in terms of crop productivity, soil nutrient
   dynamics, and soil moisture.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2020},

Abstract = {Pre-planting soil moisture plays an important role in regulating plant
   emergence rate and yield, yet there is a paucity of studies on the
   response of cotton growth and yield to pre-planting soil moisture in
   arid regions. In this study, the CROPGRO-Cotton model was used to
   simulate cotton growth and yield in a mulched drip irrigation system,
   with the interaction of different pre-planting soil water contents and
   irrigation levels during the cotton growing season. This was undertaken
   to determine the optimal pre-planting soil water contents and irrigation
   levels that would produce the highest cotton yield and biomass values in
   the model simulations. Experimental data of cotton phenology, and the
   biomass and yield at the maturing stage in 2017 and 2018 was used to
   calibrate and verify the DSSAT-CROPGRO-Cotton model outputs. Based on
   the calibrated CROPGRO-Cotton model, scenario simulation was performed
   using three irrigation levels (24 mm, 30 mm, 36 mm) and eight
   pre-planting soil water contents {[}1.2 theta(FC), 1.1 theta(FC),
   theta(FC) (field water holding capacity), 0.9 theta(FC), 0.8 theta(FC),
   0.7 theta(FC,) 0.6 theta(FC), and 0.5 theta(FC)]. The results showed
   that the simulated cotton phenology and seed cotton yield produced by
   the calibrated CROPGRO-Cotton model showed good fits with the observed
   values, thus, satisfying the accuracy requirement for large-scale,
   mulched, drip irrigated cotton field simulations. However, large
   deviations were observed between simulated and observed biomass values.
   According to the simulations, the maximum seed cotton yield and biomass
   can be obtained from a pre-planting soil water content of 0.8 theta(FC)
   - theta(FC), and the maintenance of irrigation levels at 30-36 mm during
   the cotton growing season. These simulation results may serve as
   reference data for cotton crop production and irrigation management in
   the Tarim Basin.},

   Change with Fertilizer Management in Northeast China Based on the
   Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer Model},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},

Abstract = {The risks of climate change and soil degradation for the agricultural
   environment and crop production are increasingly prominent. Based on the
   limitations of land resources, it is important to explore a sustainable
   and effective fertilization strategy to reduce risks and ensure there is
   a high yield of grain and sustainable development of agriculture. Soil
   fertility underpins cultivated land, which is the most important
   resource of agricultural production, and is also the key for maintaining
   agricultural sustainability. The central elements of soil fertility are
   soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (SN). This study applied the
   Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System
   Model (DSSAT-CSM) and the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate the
   trends of crop yields, SN storages and SOC storages until the end of
   this century under different climate change circumstances, based on a
   36-year long-term experiment established at Shenyang site, China. Four
   fertilizer practices were applied: control (CK), combined chemical
   fertilizer of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), NPK with manure
   (MNPK), and NPK fertilizers plus a high application rate of manure
   (hMNPK). The outcomes indicated that the DSSAT model can fully simulate
   the yields of maize and soybean as well as the dynamic stocks of the SN
   and SOC. Three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5,
   RCP 8.5) for future development were chosen from the fifth assessment
   report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
   (IPCC). Moreover, a baseline was installed. Crop yields, SN, and SOC
   storages from 2016 to 2100 were estimated under four climate scenarios
   (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and Baseline). The RCP scenarios in some
   treatments reduced SN and SOC stocks and maize yield, and had no effect
   on soybean yield. However, the application of NPK with manure could
   improve crop yields, while it increased SN and SOC storages
   substantially. To some extent, the negative effects of climate scenarios
   could be mitigated by applying manure. In the RCP 4.5, maize yields of
   NPK, MNPK, and hMNPK treatments declined by 14.8\%, 7.7\%, and 6.2\%,
   respectively, compared with that of NPK under Baseline. The NPK
   fertilizers plus manure treatments could cut the reduction of maize
   yield caused by climate change in half. Additionally, the SOC storage
   and SN of chemical fertilizers plus manure treatments under RCP
   scenarios increased by 20.2\%-33.5\% and 13.7\%-21.7\% compared with
   that of NPK under baseline, respectively. It was concluded that a
   rational combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer applications is
   a sustainable and effective agricultural measure to maintain food
   security and relieve environmental stresses.},

Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted to explore the possibilities of
   sustainable crop intensification in the fallow-Eruca sativa Mill. system
   in arid ecology by replacing fallow with short-duration sorghum-legume
   intercropping. The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design with
   two planting systems (bed and conventional) in main plots and a
   factorial combination of crop duration (50 and 60 days) and cropping
   systems (sole sorghum, sorghum + cowpea, sorghum + Sesbania in 2:2
   ratio) in sub-plots. In the succeeding Eruca sativa crop, residuals and
   two gypsum levels (0 and 250 kg ha(-1)) were tested. Bed planting
   practiced during both seasons did not improve the system productivity to
   significant levels. Extending the duration of fallow replacement crops
   from 50 to 60 days significantly increased their forage yield, overall
   system productivity by 25-34\%, and system net returns by 15.9-21.5\%.
   Amongst the intercropping systems, the sorghum + Sesbania system added
   10-13 tonnes ha-1 Sesbania biomass to the soil, resulting in higher soil
   organic carbon, available nitrogen, dehydrogenase activity, and residual
   soil moisture, which increased the yield of the succeeding Eruca sativa
   crop by 8.8-15\% compared to the residual of sole sorghum. However, it
   could not compensate for the yield loss due to the utilization of 50\%
   of the area for growing the green manure crop. The sorghum + cowpea
   intercropping-Eruca sativa system was found to be the optimum
   combination with a system productivity of 1.27-1.87 Mg ha(-1)Eruca
   sativa seed equivalent. The productivity of Eruca sativa further
   improved by 9.5-23.7\% due to the soil application of gypsum @ 250 kg
   ha-1. When averaged over treatments, fallow replacement during the rainy
   season reduced the available soil moisture at the sowing of Eruca sativa
   by 8.3-22.8\% and subsequently its yield by 16.5-30.4\% compared to the
   fallow-Eruca sativa system. However, with this production penalty, an
   additional rainy-season fodder crop was successfully grown, which
   improved the system productivity by 57.7-82.8\%, net returns by
   31.2-57.3\%, and rainfall use efficiency from 0.21 to 36 USD/mm(-1)
   ha(-1). Hence, it may be concluded that short-duration fodder crops may
   be taken as fallow replacement crops for higher system productivity and
   rainfall use efficiency.},

Abstract = {The soil moisture from the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route
   Project is assessed in this study. Complex and variable geological
   conditions complicate the prediction of soil moisture in the study area.
   To achieve this aim, we carried out research on soil moisture inversion
   methods for channel slopes in the study area using massive monitoring
   data from multiple GNSS observatories on channel slopes, incorporating
   GNSS-R techniques and deep learning algorithms. To address the issue of
   low accuracy in linear inversion when using a single satellite, this
   study proposes a multi-satellite and multi-frequency data fusion
   technique. Furthermore, three soil moisture inversion models, namely,
   the linear model, BP neural network model, and GA-BP neural network
   model, are established by incorporating deep learning techniques. In
   comparison with single-satellite data inversion, with the data fusion
   technique proposed in this study, the correlation is improved by 12.7\%,
   the root mean square error is reduced by 0.217, the mean square error is
   decreased by 0.884, and the mean absolute error is decreased by 0.243
   with the linear model. With the BP neural network model, the correlation
   is increased by 15.4\%, the root mean square error is decreased by
   0.395, the mean square error is decreased by 0.465, and the mean
   absolute error is reduced by 0.353. Moreover, with the GA-BP neural
   network model, the correlation is improved by 6.3\%, the root mean
   square error is decreased by 1.207, the mean square error is decreased
   by 0.196, and the mean absolute error is reduced by 0.155. The results
   indicate that performing data fusion by using multiple satellites and
   multi-frequency bands is a feasible approach for improving the accuracy
   of soil moisture inversion. These research findings provide new
   technical means for the risk analysis of deformation disasters in the
   expansive soil channel slopes of the South-to-North Water Diversion
   Middle Route Project.},

   PGPR with affinity to wheat, was isolated from a wheat rhizosphere via
   wheat germ agglutinin. A pTR102 plasmid harboring the luciferase luxAB
   gene was transferred into P34. The labeled strain (P34-L) was then used
   to track the temporal and spatial characteristics of rhizosphere
   colonization and examine the effects of colonization on wheat
   development. The transcript levels of the phosphate transporter gene
   TaPT4, a phosphorus deficiency indicator, in wheat roots were monitored
   by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The results
   indicated that P34-L could survive within the wheat rhizosphere for a
   long time and colonize new spaces in the wheat rhizosphere following the
   elongation of wheat roots. Compared with uninoculated wheat plants,
   plants inoculated with P34-L exhibited significantly increased
   phosphorus accumulation in the leaves; seedling and root weight; total
   root length; root projection area; root surface area; and number of root
   tips, forks, and crossings, thus demonstrating the great value of
   applying this strain in wheat production by promoting root growth and
   dry matter accumulation. The downregulation of TaPT4 transcript levels
   in the wheat roots also suggested that a high-phosphorus environment was
   established by P34-L. These results lay a foundation for further
   research on the relationships between PGPR and their host plants.
   Moreover, a potentially ideal biofertilizer-producing strain for use in
   sustainable agriculture was developed.},

Abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is a nonrenewable resource and a critical element for
   plant growth that plays an important role in improving crop yield.
   Excessive P fertilizer application is widespread in agricultural
   production, which not only wastes phosphate resources but also causes P
   accumulation and groundwater pollution. Here, we hypothesized that the
   apparent P balance of a crop system could be used as an indicator for
   identifying the critical P input in order to obtain a high yield with
   high phosphorus use efficiency (PUE). A 12-year field experiment with P
   fertilization rates of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, and 225 kg P2O5 ha-1 was
   conducted to determine the crop yield, PUE, and soil Olsen-P value
   response to P balance, and to optimize the P input. Annual yield
   stagnation occurred when the P fertilizer application exceeded a certain
   level, and high yield and PUE levels were achieved with annual P
   fertilizer application rates of 90-135 kg P2O5 ha-1. A critical P
   balance range of 2.15-4.45 kg P ha-1 was recommended to achieve optimum
   yield with minimal environmental risk. The critical P input range
   estimated from the P balance was 95.7-101 kg P2O5 ha-1, which improved
   relative yield (>90\%) and PUE (90.0-94.9\%). In addition, the P
   input-output balance helps in assessing future changes in Olsen-P
   values, which increased by 4.07 mg kg-1 of P for every 100 kg of P
   surplus. Overall, the P balance can be used as a critical indicator for
   P management in agriculture, providing a robust reference for limiting P
   excess and developing a more productive, efficient and environmentally
   friendly P fertilizer management strategy.},

   Understanding of the complex responses of soil microbial communities and

   of K fertilizer. Two field experiment sites (JY, loam soil with high pH
   and K fertility; GD, silty loam soil with low pH and K fertility) were
   selected to study the effects of K fertilizer management on enzyme
   activities and bacterial communities under soil K balance condition. K
   fertilizer treatments included no K fertilizer (K0), straw return
   combined with K fertilizer (SRK), and inorganic K fertilizer only (IK).
   Soil bacterial communities were examined using MiSeq sequencing. Wheat
   yield, soil nutrient contents, and enzyme activities were higher in the
   SRK than in the IK and K0 treatments. Available K was the most important
   factor affecting wheat yield. The SRK and IK treatments significantly
   altered bacterial communities and enzyme activities, which in turn
   affected the cycling of soil nutrients. The positive effect of the SRK
   treatment on wheat yield, enzyme activities, and potential bacterial
   functions in silty loam soil was greater than that in loam soil, which
   was closely related to soil texture, pH, and K fertility. The SRK
   measure is a promising approach to maintain crop yield and soil

Abstract = {Excessive fertilization combined with unreasonable irrigation in
   farmland of the Hetao Irrigation Area (HIR), China, has resulted in a
   large amount of nitrogen (N) losses and agricultural non-point source
   pollution. Application of soil amendments has become one of the
   important strategies for reducing N losses of farmland. However, there
   is still no systematic study on the effects of various soil amendments
   on N losses in the HIR. In this study, three types of soil amendments
   (biochar, bentonite and polyacrylamide) were applied in a maize-wheat
   rotation system in the HIR during 2015-2017. Yields of maize and wheat,
   soil NH3 volatilization, N2O emission and NO3- leaching were determined
   and soil N balance was estimated. The results showed that applications
   of biochar, bentonite and polyacrylamide significantly increased yields
   of maize by 9.2\%, 14.3\% and 13.3\%, respectively, and wheat by 9.2\%,
   16.6\% and 12.3\%, respectively, compared with the control
   (fertilization alone). Applications of biochar, bentonite and
   polyacrylamide significantly reduced soil N leaching by 23.1\%, 35.5\%
   and 27.1\%, soil NH3-N volatilization by 34.8\%, 52.7\% and 37.8\%, and
   soil N surplus by 23.9\%, 37.4\% and 30.6\%, respectively. Applications
   of bentonite and polyacrylamide significantly reduced N2O-N emissions
   from soil by 37.3\% and 35.8\%, respectively, compared with the control.
   Compared with application of biochar, applications of bentonite and
   polyacrylamide increased yields of maize and wheat by 5.1\% and 3.5\%,
   respectively. Our results suggest that soil amendments (bentonite and
   polyacrylamide) can play important roles in reducing N losses and
   increasing yield for the maize-wheat rotation system in the HIR, China.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilizer application has revolutionized agricultural
   productivity, but excessive N fertilizer application has resulted in low
   N use efficiency (NUE) and high N accumulation, increasing the risk of N
   losses. Here, we hypothesize that the apparent N balance can be used as
   an indicator to identify the N input for obtaining high yield with a
   high NUE. Thus, a 12-year field experiment involving seven N treatments
   (0, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600, and 720 kg N ha-1 per year) in a typical
   winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in North China was conducted
   to investigate the response of crop yield and NUE to the N balance under
   different N application rates and to identify the N input-output
   framework. The annual yield increased in a linear-platform and NUE
   decreased with increasing N fertilizer application. The N balance and
   yield are strongly correlated to predict changes in yield, and a
   critical N balance of 44.4-64.9 kg N ha-1 per year was recommended for
   optimal yield with minimal risk of N loss. The N balance and NUE can be
   presented in the framework of N input-output, and the critical N input
   estimated from the N balance of 217-252 kg N ha-1 could obtain high
   productivity with high NUE (74.3-79.6 \%). Overall, the apparent N

Abstract = {The uneven rainfall distribution, limited soil nutrients, and continuous
   cropping effect in the Loess Plateau restrict the sustainable
   development of fruit tree/crop (soybean and maize) intercropping
   systems. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the
   effects of different water and fertilizer regimes on the soil nutrients
   and growth of intercropping systems during the crop replacement period.
   The experiment involved three irrigation levels (0\% (I0), 50\% (I1),
   and 80\% (I2) of field capacity), two irrigation methods (drip
   irrigation (DI) and flood irrigation (FI)), and three fertilizer
   application rates (0 (F0), 375 (F1), and 750 (F2) kg/hm2). The results
   showed that in 2020 and 2021, the soil water contents increased with
   increasing irrigation and fertilization. The soil ammonium nitrogen,
   nitrate nitrogen, and soil organic matter contents in 2021 were
   21.0\%-68.4\% higher than those in 2020. Increasing the fertilizer
   application rate improved the photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate
   of apples and maize in 2020 but had a reverse U-shape effect on soybeans
   in 2021. Irrigation and fertilization increased soybean and maize yields
   by 2.9\%-30.5\% compared with the I0F0 treatment. The maize root
   indicators generally showed an increasing trend followed by a decreasing
   trend with increasing fertilizer application in 2020, while soybean
   exhibited an opposite pattern in 2021. The FI1F1 and DI2F2 treatments
   yielded the optimal economic benefit in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
   Therefore, from an economic standpoint, FI and DI would have been
   recommended in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Factor analysis suggested
   that the DI2F2 treatments had the highest comprehensive benefits over
   the two years studied. Therefore, we recommend using DI combined with
   80\% field capacity irrigation and 750 kg/hm2 fertilization to maximize
   the comprehensive benefits of intercropping systems during the crop
   replacement period.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is one of the critical variables in maintaining the global
   water cycle balance. Moreover, it plays a vital role in climate change,
   crop growth, and environmental disaster event monitoring, and it is
   important to monitor soil moisture continuously. Recently, Global
   Navigation Satellite System interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR)
   technology has become essential for monitoring soil moisture. However,
   the sparse distribution of GNSS-IR soil moisture sites has hindered the
   application of soil moisture products. In this paper, we propose a
   multi-data fusion soil moisture inversion algorithm based on machine
   learning. The method uses the Genetic Algorithm Back-Propagation (GA-BP)
   neural network model, by combining GNSS-IR site data with other surface
   environmental parameters around the site. In turn, soil moisture is
   obtained by inversion, and we finally obtain a soil moisture product
   with a high spatial and temporal resolution of 500 m per day. The
   multi-surface environmental data include latitude and longitude
   information, rainfall, air temperature, land cover type, normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), and four topographic factors
   (elevation, slope, slope direction, and shading). To maximize the
   spatial and temporal resolution of the GNSS-IR technique within a
   machine learning framework, we obtained satisfactory results with a
   cross-validated R-value of 0.8660 and an ubRMSE of 0.0354. This
   indicates that the machine learning approach learns the complex
   nonlinear relationships between soil moisture and the input
   multi-surface environmental data. The soil moisture products were
   analyzed compared to the contemporaneous rainfall and National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s soil moisture products.
   The results show that the spatial distribution of the GA-BP inversion
   soil moisture products is more consistent with rainfall and NASA
   products, which verifies the feasibility of using this experimental
   model to generate 500 m per day the GA-BP inversion soil moisture
   products.},

Abstract = {Understanding the impacts of plant age on bamboo growth, soil nutrient
   and functional microorganism can assist in the development of management
   practices to maximize the benefits of nutrients and functional
   endophytic and soil microbes in moso bamboo plantations. In this study,
   moso bamboos of different ages (0.5, 2.5, 4.5 and 6.5 years) were
   selected. The above-ground biomass, soil properties and endophytic
   microbes of above-ground tissue and stump root of different age bamboos
   were quantified, and their interactive relationships were also examined.
   There were negligible differences in the heights and above-ground fresh
   biomass among the bamboo plants of different ages, but net nitrogen (N)
   mineralization and potential nitrification rates of soils were
   significantly affected by the bamboo ages. The soil nprA gene abundances
   decreased with the bamboo ages, and soil AOB amoA gene abundances of the
   0.5-yr bamboo were significantly higher than those of the other older
   plants. Average soil urease activities of the 2.5-yr, 4.5-yr and 6.5-yr
   bamboos were 81.4\%, 81.1\% and 88.2\% lower than those of the 0.5-yr
   bamboo, respectively. Bacterial diversity indices and richness
   estimators in the soils were significantly higher than those in the
   above-ground tissues. Endophytic microbial community structures were
   more sensitive to the bamboo ages than the soil counterparts, and
   endophytic microbial community diversities and structures in the
   above-ground tissues were significantly changed with the bamboo ages.
   Bacterial and fungal community structures in the above-ground tissues
   were significantly different from those in the soils. Bamboo ages
   significantly affected the N transformations in the soils and endophytic
   community structures, but niche differentiations among the above-ground
   tissue, stump root and soil outweighed the plant ages in shaping the
   whole microbial communities of plant-soil system.},

Abstract = {The long-term continuous mono-cropping and application of large amount
   of chemical fertilizers have led to a dramatic degradation of soil
   quality in the intensive vegetable production system. It is important to
   develop more sustainable, environmentally friendly and high-efficiency
   agroecosystems for vegetable production in plastic shed systems. Field
   experiments were performed to explore the impacts of Bacillus megaterium
   application on cucumber yields, the bioavailability of soil phosphorus
   (P) and potassium (K), properties of soil microbial communities in a
   plastic shed production system with cucumber mono-cropped for more than
   15 years. The field trails were set up with four treatments of
   conventional fertilization as control (CON), conventional fertilization
   with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM), conventional fertilization reduced
   by 10 \% P and 10 \% (or 5 \%) K from chemical fertilizer with Bacillus
   megaterium (CON + BM PK1), conventional fertilization reduced by 20 \% P
   and 20 \% (or 10 \%) K from chemical fertilizer with Bacillus megaterium
   (CON + BM PK2). Results illustrated that CON + BM treatment
   significantly increased the cucumber yields by 11.8 \%-15.2 \% and P and
   K accumulation in cucumber fruits and roots by 27.5 \%-46.1 \% and 17.8
   \%-45.1 \%, respectively. The treatments of CON + BM PK1 and CON + BM
   PK2 did not decrease the yields and quality of cucumber, and the
   bioavailability of soil P and K compared with CON + BM. Moreover, the
   strain of Bacillus megaterium can efficiently colonize the soil at the
   early stage of inoculation and improved the richness of soil bacterial
   and fungal communities significantly. High-throughput sequencing
   identified that the application of Bacillus megaterium did not change
   the compositions of the predominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria,
   Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and predominant fungal phylum
   Ascomycota in soil, but increased the relative abundances of the
   beneficial bacterial genera and fungal orders and suppressed the
   development of pathogenic bacterial genus significantly. Principal
   coordinate analysis revealed that the structures of soil bacterial and
   fungal communities in the CON + BM treatment were dramatically separated
   from CON at the early stage of inoculation. Moreover, soil pH, available
   K (AK), total P (TP), and total K (TK) were dramatically related to the
   changes of soil bacterial community structure, while soil AK and TK were
   dramatically linked to the variations of soil fungal community
   structure. The findings indicated that the application of Bacillus
   megaterium might contribute to the development of a more sustainable
   production system of vegetables in plastic shed via improving the
   properties of soil microbial community and the bioavailability of soil P
   and K.},

   evaluated the effects of long -term organic substitution on soil P
   availability and microbial activity in greenhouse vegetable fields. A
   10-year (2009-2019) field experiment was carried out to investigate the
   impacts of organic fertilizer substitution on soil P pools, phosphatase
   activities and the microbial community, and identify factors that
   regulate these soil P transformation characteristics. Four treatments
   included 100\% chemical N fertilizer (4CN), 50\% substitution of
   chemical N by manure (2CN+2MN), straw (2CN+2SN), and combined manure
   with straw (2CN+1MN+1SN). Compared with the 4CN treatment, organic
   substitution treatments increased celery and tomato yields by 6.9-13.8\%
   and 8.6-18.1\%, respectively, with the highest yields being in the
   2CN+1MN+1SN treatment. After 10 years of fertilization, organic
   substitution treatments reduced total P and inorganic P accumulation,
   increased the concentrations of available P, organic P, and microbial
   biomass P, and promoted phosphatase activities (alkaline and acid
   phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, and phytase) and microbial
   growth in comparison with the 4CN treatment. Further, organic
   substitution treatments significantly increased soil C/P, and the
   partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed that the soil C/P
   ratio directly and significantly affected phosphatase activities and the
   microbial biomass and positively influenced soil P pools and vegetable
   yield. Partial least squares (PLS) regression demonstrated that
   arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi positively affected phosphatase activities.
   Our results suggest that organic fertilizer substitution can promote
   soil P transformation and availability. Combining manure with straw was
   more effective than applying these materials separately for developing
   sustainable P management practices.},

Title = {Development of a data-assimilation system to forecast agricultural
   systems: A case study of constraining soil water and soil nitrogen
   dynamics in the APSIM model},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {As we face today's large-scale agricultural issues, the need for robust
   methods of agricultural forecasting has never been clearer. Yet, the
   accuracy and precision of our forecasts remains limited by current tools
   and methods. To overcome the limitations of process-based models and
   observed data, we iteratively designed and tested a generalizable and
   robust data-assimilation system that systematically constrains state
   variables in the APSIM model to improve forecast accuracy and precision.
   Our final novel system utilizes the Ensemble Kalman Filter to constrain
   model states and update model parameters at observed time steps and
   incorporates an algorithm that improves system performance through the
   joint estimation of system error matrices. We tested this system at the
   Energy Farm, a well-monitored research site in central Illinois, where
   we assimilated observed in situ soil moisture at daily time steps for
   two years and evaluated how assimilation impacted model forecasts of
   soil moisture, yield, leaf area index, tile flow, and nitrate leaching
   by comparing estimates with in situ observations. The system improved
   the accuracy and precision of soil moisture estimates for the
   assimilation layers by an average of 42\% and 48\%, respectively, when
   compared to the free model. Such improvements led to changes in the
   model's soil water and nitrogen processes and, on average, increased
   accuracy in forecasts of annual tile flow by 43\% and annual nitrate
   loads by 10\%. Forecasts of aboveground measures did not dramatically
   change with assimilation, a fact which highlights the limited potential
   of soil moisture as a constraint for a site with no water stress.
   Extending the scope of previous work, our results demonstrate the power
   of data assimilation to constrain important model estimates beyond the
   assimilated state variable, such as nitrate leaching. Replication of
   this study is necessary to further define the limitations and
   opportunities of the developed system.},

Title = {Impacts of Different Long-Term Fertilizer Management Regimes on Soil
   Nitrogen Mineralization and Its Enzyme Activities under a

Abstract = {Soil extracellular enzyme activities play an important role in
   regulating the soil nitrogen (N) mineralization process in paddy fields.
   However, there is still a need to further study how N mineralization
   responds to different fertilizer management techniques and the soil
   extracellular enzyme activities for N mineralization in paddy fields.
   Therefore, the influence of different long-term (35 years) fertilizer
   regimes on soil N mineralization, hydrolysable N fractions-such as
   hydrolyzed unknown nitrogen (HUN), amino acid nitrogen (AAN), amino
   sugar nitrogen (ASN), ammonia nitrogen (AN), and total acid-hydrolyzed
   nitrogen (TAN)-and their extracellular enzyme activities (soil urease,
   L-glutaminase, \& beta;-glucosidase, arylamidase, and \&
   beta;-glucosaminidase) in a double-cropping rice field in southern China
   were investigated in this study. The field experiment included the
   following fertilizer regimes: rice straw and inorganic fertilizer (RF),
   30\% organic manure and 70\% inorganic fertilizer (OM), inorganic
   fertilizer alone (MF), and no application of inorganic fertilizer as a
   control (CK). The results show that the soil ammonium N, amino sugar N,
   hydrolysable unidentified N, and amino acid N contents in the paddy
   field with RF treatment increased by 30.56\%, 5.51\%, and 62.74\%
   compared with the CK treatment. The results show that the soil aerobic
   and anaerobic N mineralization rates in the paddy fields with OM and RF
   treatments increased by 22.92\% and 18.27\% compared with those with MF
   treatment. Moreover, soil extracellular enzyme activities under RF and
   OM treatments significantly increased, which indicated that the main
   substrate of microbial activity was effective. Correlation analysis
   indicated that the soil L-glutaminase activity, amino sugar N, amino
   acid N, and total acid-hydrolysable N contents were positively
   correlated with soil aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization rates in
   paddy fields. However, there was a negative correlation between the soil
   N mineralization rate and soil \& beta;-glucosaminidase activity in
   paddy fields. This finding shows that the yields of early rice and late
   rice under the RF and OM treatments were significantly higher than those
   under the MF and CK treatments. Compared with the MF treatment, the
   yields of double-cropping rice with RF and OM treatments increased by
   9.84\% and 11.37\%, respectively. As a result, the application of straw
   or organic manure and inorganic fertilizer was effective for improving
   soil N mineralization, the soil acid-hydrolyzed N content, and
   extracellular enzyme activities in double-cropping rice fields.},

   Nutrient Concentrations and Relationships with Yield from Planting

Abstract = {The impact of various production systems on leaf nutrient concentration
   and soil organic matter, pH, and nutrient status was evaluated from the
   first growing season (2007) through maturity (2016) in a certified
   organic planting of northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum
   L.). Treatments included planting method (on raised beds or flat
   ground), fertilizer source (granular feather meal or fish solubles) and
   rate ({''}low'' and ``high'' rates of 29 and 57 kg.ha(-1) N,
   respectively, during establishment, increased incrementally as the
   planting matured to 73 and 140 kg.ha(-1) N, respectively), mulch
   {[}sawdust, yard-debris compost topped with sawdust (compost + sawdust),
   or black, woven polyethylene groundcover (weed mat)], and cultivar (Duke
   or Liberty). Mulches were replenished, as needed, and weeds were
   controlled throughout the study. The impacts of year, planting method,
   fertilizer, mulch, and cultivar on leaf and soil nutrient levels over
   this 10-year study were complex with many interactions among treatments.
   Soil pH remained within the recommended range for all treatments. Plants
   fertilized with fish solubles had higher leaf N, P, and K concentrations
   than those fertilized with feather meal, particularly at the high N rate
   in both cultivars. By contrast, fertilization with feather meal
   increased leaf Ca. Compost + sawdust added a cumulative (2007-16) total
   of 2274, 400, 961, and 2744 kg.ha(-1) of N, P, K, and Ca, respectively,
   over the use of sawdust alone, and increased the concentration of P, K
   (as much as 90\%), Ca, and Mg in the soil relative to other mulches.
   Soil organic matter content averaged 4.1\% under compost + sawdust,
   3.3\% under sawdust, and 2.9\% under weed mat, averaged over the last 5
   years. Mulching with weed mat or compost + sawdust increased leaf K
   compared with sawdust in both cultivars, regardless of fertilizer
   treatment. Leaf Ca, on the other hand, was highest with sawdust and
   tended to be lowest with weed mat in both cultivars. Soil nutrient
   levels were not consistently correlated with leaf nutrient
   concentrations, other than between soil NO3-N and leaf N (5 years) and
   between soil and leaf K (4 years). On average, raised beds resulted in
   higher concentrations of N, P, K, Fe, and Al and lower concentrations of
   Ca, Mg, and B in the leaves than planting on flat ground. Furthermore,
   concentrations of N and Ca in recent fully-expanded leaves at standard
   sampling time was higher in young plants than in mature plants in both
   cultivars, whereas the opposite was found for leaf P. In `Duke', yield
   was positively correlated with leaf Ca in 8 out of 9 years and
   negatively correlated with leaf K and P in 5 and 6 years, respectively.
   Leaf Ca and Mg were also negatively correlated with leaf K in most years
   for both cultivars, as was leaf N. Although leaf N concentration was
   higher with added compost, regardless of fertilizer source in `Duke',
   and when fertilized with feather meal in `Liberty', this was not
   correlated with yield. High N rates increased leaf N concentration, but
   did not result in greater yield. While soil and leaf tissue testing are
   important to help manage fertilizer programs, the lack of a consistent
   relationship between soil and plant nutrient status and yield was a
   reflection of the complicated interactions that occurred among nutrients
   in these organic production systems.
   Soil nutrient imbalances and changes in leaf nutrient concentrations
   associated with extended use of compost + sawdust mulch and fish
   solubles may lead to growth and yield problems in longer-lived
   plantings. In addition, the loss of organic matter under weed mat would
   need to be addressed in long-term plantings for sustainable production.},

Title = {Variation of soil moisture and fine roots distribution adopts rainwater
   collection, infiltration promoting and soil anti-seepage system

Abstract = {Improving the utilization efficiency of rainwater resources was a key
   issue for apple orchards in semi-arid areas. The RCIP-SA system combined
   rainwater collection systems, infiltration promoting tube and soil
   anti-seepage layer to gather limited rainwater resources into the soil
   layer where the roots of apple tree were concentrated. To evaluate the
   effect of the RCIP-SA system on soil moisture change and fine root
   distribution, a field experiment was completed in a hilly apple orchard
   on the Loess Plateau of China from 2017 to 2019. The results showed that
   the soil moisture of the RCIP-SA system was 24.0-43.9\% higher than CK
   in the 0-60 cm soil layer in the rainwater collection ditch, and
   generated a larger area with higher moisture content near the
   impermeable layer during the apple tree growth period. The RCIP-SA
   system also expanded the dense distribution zone of apple tree roots.
   The dry fine root densities of apple trees in the RCIP-SA system in the
   0-200 cm soil layer was 11.7-59.6\% and 18.2-30.3\% higher than CK under
   the plastic film (60 cm from the trunk) and edge of the rainwater
   collection ditch (100 cm from the trunk), respectively. Soil moisture
   and root distribution of apple trees were significantly different under
   different impermeable layers, and compacted red clay as the impermeable
   layer was the best anti-seepage strategy in RCIP-SA systems. The RCIP-SA
   system brought higher economic benefits; the average yield per tree was
   recorded for red clay compaction treatment (38.1 kg.tree(-1)), equating
   to a production level of 22 800 kg.ha(-1), and a difference of 9.6
   kg.tree(-1) with CK treatment, equating to 5700 kg.ha(-1). This strategy
   should be recommended as an agricultural measurement for apple
   production on the Loess Plateau of China.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces an ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) in the
   context of jointly assimilating observations of surface soil moisture
   (SSM) and the leaf area index (LAI) in the Land Data Assimilation System
   LDAS-Monde. By ingesting those satellite-derived products, LDAS-Monde
   constrains the Interaction between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA)
   land surface model (LSM), coupled with the CNRM (Centre National de
   Recherches Meteorologiques) version of the Total Runoff Integrating
   Pathways (CTRIP) model to improve the reanalysis of land surface
   variables (LSVs). To evaluate its ability to produce improved LSVs
   reanalyses, the EnSRF is compared with the simplified extended Kalman
   filter (SEKF), which has been well studied within the LDAS-Monde
   framework. The comparison is carried out over the Euro-Mediterranean
   region at a 0.25 degrees spatial resolution between 2008 and 2017. Both
   data assimilation approaches provide a positive impact on SSM and LAI
   estimates with respect to the model alone, putting them closer to
   assimilated observations. The SEKF and the EnSRF have a similar
   behaviour for LAI showing performance levels that are influenced by the
   vegetation type. For SSM, EnSRF estimates tend to be closer to
   observations than SEKF values. The comparison between the two data
   assimilation approaches is also carried out on unobserved soil moisture
   in the other layers of soil. Unobserved control variables are updated in
   the EnSRF through covariances and correlations sampled from the ensemble
   linking them to observed control variables. In our context, a strong
   correlation between SSM and soil moisture in deeper soil layers is
   found, as expected, showing seasonal patterns that vary geographically.
   Moderate correlation and anti-correlations are also noticed between LAI
   and soil moisture, varying in space and time. Their absolute value,
   reaching their maximum in summer and their minimum in winter, tends to
   be larger for soil moisture in root-zone areas, showing that
   assimilating LAI can have an influence on soil moisture. Finally an
   independent evaluation of both assimilation approaches is conducted
   using satellite estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary
   production (GPP) as well as measures of river discharges from gauging
   stations. The EnSRF shows a systematic albeit moderate improvement of
   root mean square differences (RMSDs) and correlations for ET and GPP
   products, but its main improvement is observed on river discharges with
   a high positive impact on Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency scores. Compared to
   the EnSRF, the SEKF displays a more contrasting performance.},

Abstract = {Accurately simulating the soil nitrogen (N) cycle is crucial for
   assessing food security and resource utilization efficiency. The
   accuracy of model predictions relies heavily on model parameterization.
   The sensitivity and uncertainty of the simulations of soil N cycle of
   winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP)
   to the parameters were analyzed. First, the N module in the Vegetation
   Interface Processes (VIP) model was expanded to capture the dynamics of
   soil N cycle calibrated with field measurements in three ecological
   stations from 2000 to 2015. Second, the Morris and Sobol' algorithms
   were adopted to identify the sensitive parameters that impact soil
   nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate.
   Finally, the shuffled complex evolution developed at the University of
   Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to optimize the selected sensitive
   parameters to improve prediction accuracy. The results showed that the
   sensitive parameters related to soil nitrate stock included the
   potential nitrification rate, Michaelis constant, microbial C/N ratio,
   and slow humus C/N ratio, the sensitive parameters related to
   denitrification rate were the potential denitrification rate, Michaelis
   constant, and N2O production rate, and the sensitive parameters related
   to ammonia volatilization rate included the coefficient of ammonia
   volatilization exchange and potential nitrification rate. Based on the
   optimized parameters, prediction efficiency was notably increased with
   the highest coefficient of determination being approximately 0.8.
   Moreover, the average relative interval length at the 95\% confidence
   level for soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia
   volatilization rate were 11.92, 0.008, and 4.26, respectively, and the
   percentages of coverage of the measured values in the 95\% confidence
   interval were 68\%, 86\%, and 92\%, respectively. By identifying
   sensitive parameters related to soil N, the expanded VIP model optimized
   by the SCE-UA algorithm can effectively simulate the dynamics of soil
   nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate in
   the NCP.},
