Abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) measurements are important for numerous
   applications including climate and weather prediction, agriculture and
   irrigation activities, and monitoring the progress of reclamation on
   land disturbed by mining or other industrial activities. We assessed the
   SWC measurement accuracy of a cosmic-ray soil moisture probe (CRP) and
   explored the possibility of downscaling the CRP measurement to the plot
   scale. The experiments were conducted at a highly heterogeneous
   reclamation site in the Alberta Oil Sands near Fort McMurray, Alberta,
   Canada. The study site is unique because it consists of 36 one hectare
   plots composed of 12 different reclamation covers made up of various
   layering schemes of peat and coarse-textured soil. The one-hectare plots
   also contain different vegetation (species and density). A CRP was
   installed in the center of the reclamation study site and calibrated
   using soil core samples. CRP-measured SWC was compared to weighted
   average SWC measured from soil cores and a network of soil moisture
   probes within the CRP footprint over two summers. The CRP responded
   clearly to precipitation events with peaks in the measured SWC and the
   CRP estimates of SWC were very close to SWC estimated with soil cores
   and in-situ soil moisture probes with a RMSE of 0.027 cm(3) cm(-3) and
   0.027 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively, over the two summers. We also
   attempted to downscale the CRP measurements from the 2014 season to the
   plot scale using HYDRUS-1D modeling and the known soil texture in order
   to unweight the CRP-measured SWC. The modeled SWC (optimized with the
   CRP measurements) within the CRP footprint was relatively close to the
   CRP-measured SWC with a RMSE of 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3). Overall, the CRP
   provided accurate average SWC measurements at the reclamation site
   despite the soil and vegetation heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {A Multiprobe Heat Pulse Sensor for Soil Moisture Measurement Based on

Abstract = {Heat dissipation sensors operate based on the temperature dependence of
   the transient heat conduction within the soil, which is a function of
   the soil characteristics and its water content. After a heat pulse with
   controlled energy is applied to a heater, it is possible to show that
   the maximum temperature rise Delta T-M measured in the temperature
   sensing element can be related to the volumetric water content of the
   soil theta(v) {[}m(3) m(-3)]. The design and fabrication of a low-cost
   soil moisture multiprobe heat pulse sensor system using conventional
   printed circuit boards and surface-mount devices is presented. The
   proposed sensor is free of the needles' deflection problem present in
   conventional multiprobe sensors and is manufactured using conventional
   off-the-shelf electronic components. A precision low-power electronic
   signal conditioning circuit, using an instrumentation switched-capacitor
   building block, was developed and successfully used in the prototype.
   Due to an energy-efficient topology for the sensor and a low-power
   signal conditioning circuit, the average current consumption of the
   system (with one measurement per day) is only 3 mu A. To demonstrate the
   feasibility of the concept, a prototype of the sensor was tested in
   soils with volumetric humidity in the range from theta(v) = 0.05 m(3)
   m(-3) to theta(v) = 0.41 m(3) m(-3) and, with a very low heating energy
   pulse (3 J), showed a sensitivity, normalized by the total energy
   applied, Gamma = 211 x 10(-3) degrees C m(3) m(-3) J(-1). Compared with
   a button heat pulse probe sensor which has Gamma = 192 x 10(-3) degrees
   C m(3) m(-3) J(-1), the developed sensor shows a higher normalized
   sensitivity.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray soil moisture sensors have the advantage of a large
   measurement footprint (approximately 700m in diameter) and are able to
   operate continuously to provide area-averaged near-surface (top 10-20cm)
   volumetric soil moisture content at the field scale. This paper presents
   the application of this technique at four sites in southern England over
   almost 3years. Results show the soil moisture response to contrasting
   climatic conditions during 2011-2014 and are the first such field-scale
   measurements made in the UK. These four sites are prototype stations for
   a UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System, and particular
   consideration is given to sensor operating conditions in the UK.
   Comparison of these soil water content observations with the Joint UK
   Land Environment Simulator 10-cm soil moisture layer shows that these
   data can be used to test and diagnose model performance and indicate the
   potential for assimilation of these data into hydro-meteorological
   models. The application of these large-area soil water content
   measurements to evaluate remotely sensed soil moisture products is also
   demonstrated. Numerous applications and the future development of a
   national COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System network are
   discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a sensor-based platform that travels through an
   underground pipeline system and monitors the soil water content in real
   time. It consists of a modified commercial soil water sensor (Diviner
   2000), which is placed on two circular articulated wheeled bases, each
   of them driven by a small wheeled electric motor. An electronic module
   allows the user to control the platform by sending commands (move one
   step forward or backwards) from the ground station. Experiments were
   carried out in laboratory conditions in an artificial tank 10 m long by
   0.6 m wide, and with a depth of 0.4 m (total volume 2.4 m(3)). The PVC
   pipelines were placed horizontally at depths of 0.1 m and 0.3 m under
   the soil surface. The sensor-based platform demonstrated very good
   mobility and produced records of the soil water content in the different
   horizons. The recorded values were then plotted as volumetric water
   content (m(3) m(-3)) versus time. The application to a border irrigation
   case study provided the spatial variability of the water content, so
   that precise information about the soil environment was gathered. Also,
   in a drip irrigation case study, the sensor-based platform gave
   important information about the technical stage of the drip irrigation
   system. Thus, the measurement of soil water using the proposed method is
   more effective than measuring the soil water status at a single point
   and assuming soil homogeneity. (C) 2012 IAgrE. Published by Elsevier

Title = {Effect of sensor installation on the accurate measurement of soil water
   content},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOIL SCIENCE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {68},
Number = {6},
Pages = {817-828},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {We evaluated the effects of different methods of installing a
   capacitance soil moisture sensor on the sensor's output with six soil
   types and three methods of sensor installation. For Method 1, the sensor
   was first placed in a container and then buried. For Method 2, the
   entire sensor (including prongs and circuitry) was inserted into a
   prepacked soil sample. For Method 3, the sensor prongs were installed
   directly into a prepacked soil sample, and then soil was placed around
   the circuitry. The sensor outputs of Method 1 were significantly smaller
   for the volumetric soil water content () of most of the soil types
   compared with the sensor outputs of the other two methods. Large
   differences in sensor outputs were observed in relation to the
   installation method, which resulted in a large estimation error when
   using a soil moisture sensor. For example, the difference in values
   calculated by the calibration equation obtained by Methods 1 and 2 was
   0.076 m(3) m(-3), a maximum for the Andisol sample. We observed a
   significant linear relation between the maximum differences in (which
   might result from the different sensor installation methods) and the
   coarse pore volume determined from soil water characteristic curves.
   Compaction around the sensor induced by sensor installation, which might
   be considerable for soil with many coarse pores, was considered the main
   reason for an increase in the soil moisture sensor's output value. For
   the sensor installed by Methods 2 or 3, a second-order polynomial
   equation could be used to translate sensor output to accurately except
   for soils with > 40\% clay content or very low bulk density.
   Highlights
   An appropriate calibration equation is important to monitor soil water
   content precisely. Effects of different sensor installation methods on
   calibration equations have not been determined. Method of installation
   considerably affected output values of a capacitance sensor. Soil
   compaction by sensor installation increases the sensor output: more so
   in coarse pore soil.},

   profile using heated carbon fibers},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {175-184},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil moisture variation with respect to depth directly affects the
   engineering properties of soil and the health state of plants. At the
   present, there are few techniques that can satisfactorily quantify the
   vertical moisture profile within the soil medium. In this paper, a fiber
   optic sensor-based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technique is
   introduced for soil moisture profile mapping. In this technique, a
   carbon fiber heated sensing-tube (CFHST) is integrated into conventional
   fiber optic sensing cable to improve the sensitivity, accuracy and
   spatial resolution of the measurement of soil moisture profile. The
   CFHST consists of three parts: the inner tubing, the carbon fiber heated
   cable (CFHC) tightly wrapped on inner tubing, and the interface screws
   installed on both ends of the inner tubing. The length of a unit CFHST
   is adjustable according to the actual demand of a specified application.
   The power supply model and installation method in field are introduced.
   Laboratory tests were conducted to establish the relationship between
   soil moisture and thermal response of CFHST. A foundation pit dewatering
   test was also carried out to validate the field performance of this
   monitoring technique. The test results show that the borehole-embedded
   sensor monitored and recorded the continuous change of soil moisture
   profile accurately (RMSE = 0.046 m(3)/m(3)). This technique can
   effectively capture the distribution profile of soil moisture along the
   depth direction, which provides a new approach to investigate the
   physical and hydrological properties of soils.},

   Remote Sensing and Linear Mixed Effects},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor
   temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed
   imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on
   dates outside the time series through statistically independent
   validation. A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were
   collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over
   one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear
   Mixed Effects models (LMEs). A single-date airborne Light Detection and
   Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with
   temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since
   Last Rain, Day of Year). LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted
   for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences
   associated with peatland classes. Covariates provided a large amount of
   explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a
   moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R-2 = 0.07;
   conditional R-2 = 0.7, independently validated R-2 = 0.36). The use of
   LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a
   function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement
   dates on model strength and predictive power. For intensively monitored
   peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class
   (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the
   spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a
   ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and
   temporal resolution to fit the LME models.},

Abstract = {We report the use of the microwave remote sensing as a technique with
   great potential for the mapping of subsurface properties including the
   monitoring of soil water conditions. Remote sensing experiments with
   microwave instrumentation were conducted in the Negev desert in Israel.

   and an ERS-2 C-band (5.3 cm, 5.7 GHz) SAR ( synthetic aperture radar)
   along with the collection of ground truth data such as volumetric and
   gravimetric soil water-content, surface roughness and dielectric
   measurements. Corner reflectors in the field were used for calibration
   and geo-rectification of the SAR data. The results of the microwave
   experiments are in a good agreement with the developed theoretical
   models that take into account the effects of the random surface
   roughness. The optical modelling of microwave processes is presented as
   a tool for developing the physical basis for empirical studies. This
   practice simplifies testing theoretical predictions and reduces the
   immense cost of running field and laboratory measurements in the

Abstract = {GNSS-Reflectometry is an efficient tool for remote sensing and plays a
   key role in several applications. The estimation of soil moisture and
   vegetation in the land field is attracting widespread interest in
   hydrology, climatology and carbon cycles. In order to investigate the
   scattering polarization properties from different types of surface
   environments, an airborne measurement was performed, equipped with a new
   4-channel prototype for collecting the direct, reflected left-hand
   circular polarization (LHCP) and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP)
   signals. Both the reflected LHCP and RHCP signals were acquired at the
   same time by a dual polarization antenna. A data averaging procedure was
   used to reduce the incoherent part of the received power and two
   reflected signals were normalized by direct signals obtained from each
   front-end (FE). Then three polarimetric observables were used to analyze
   vegetation biomass and soil moisture fluctuations. It was concluded that
   the polarimetric ratio (PR) is sensitive to soil moisture content (SMC)
   and considerably independent of roughness and vegetation biomass. The
   trunk component is confirmed to be the most important factor affecting
   the amplitude of scattering polarizations. Furthermore, the measurement
   results showed that the PR variation between different elevation angles
   was affected by roughness and biomass. The PR variation in forests with
   big biomass shows the least amount of changes when compared to other
   geographical environments. The results show another possibility of
   further geophysical parameter evaluations employing polarimetric

Abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) was built and deployed in three fields
   to monitor soil moisture status and collect weather, data for irrigation
   scheduling. The WSN consists of soil moisture sensors, weather sensors,
   wireless data loggers, and a wireless modem. Soil moisture sensors were
   installed at three depths below the ground surface in various locations
   across the fields. Weather sensors were mounted on a 3-m instrument
   tower. An antenna mount was designed and fabricated for use in the WSN.
   When field equipment such as a fertilizer or chemical applicator
   impacted the mount, the mount was capable of protecting the antenna from
   damage by the equipment. In the WSN, received radio signal strength of
   Em50R data logger decreased as the distance from the data logger to the
   receiver increased. It also decreased as the distance between the top of
   the plant canopy and the logger's antenna above the plant canopy
   decreased. The antenna of the Em50R logger required replacement above
   the plant canopy for effective data communication. The Em50G data logger
   was capable of transferring data as its antenna was inside the plant
   canopy. Using the WSN system, soil moisture and weather conditions
   including precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity were
   measured every minute and the hourly averages were reported and stored
   at 1-h interval. The soil moisture data and weather data were
   automatically and wirelessly transmitted to the internet making the data
   available online. Data collected by the WSN have been used in irrigation
   scheduling research in cotton, corn and soybean crops.},

Title = {In-Situ Soil Moisture Sensing: Optimal Sensor Placement and Field
   Estimation},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {4},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {We study the problem of optimal sensor placement in the context of soil
   moisture sensing. We show that the soil moisture data possesses some
   unique features that can be used together with the commonly used
   Gaussian assumption to construct more scalable, robust, and better
   performing placement algorithms. Specifically, there exists a
   coarse-grained monotonic ordering of locations in their soil moisture
   level over time, both in terms of its first and second moments, a
   feature much more stable than the soil moisture process itself at these
   locations. This motivates a clustered sensor placement scheme, where
   locations are classified into clusters based on the ordering of the
   mean, with the number of sensors placed in each cluster determined by
   the ordering of the variances. We show that under idealized conditions
   the greedy mutual information maximization algorithm applied globally is
   equivalent to that applied cluster by cluster, but the latter has the
   advantage of being more scalable. Extensive numerical experiments are
   performed on a set of three-dimensional soil moisture data generated by
   a state-of-the-art soil moisture simulator. Our results show that our
   clustering approach outperforms applying the same algorithms globally,
   and is very robust to lack of training and errors in training data.},

Title = {Two Solutions of Soil Moisture Sensing with RFID for Landslide
   Monitoring},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Two solutions for UHF RFID tags for soil moisture sensing were designed
   and are described in this paper. In the first, two conventional tags
   (standard transponders) are employed: one, placed close to the soil
   surface, is the sensor tag, while the other, separated from the soil, is
   the reference for system calibration. By transmission power ramps, the
   tag's turn-on power levels are measured and correlated with soil
   condition (dry or wet). In the second solution, the SL900A chip, which
   supports up to two external sensors and an internal temperature sensor,
   is used. An interdigital capacitive sensor was connected to the
   transponder chip and used for soil moisture measurement. In a novel
   design for an UHF RFID tag the sensor is placed below the soil surface,
   while the transponder and antenna are above the soil to improve
   communication. Both solutions are evaluated practically and results show
   the presence of water in soil can be remotely detected allowing for
   their application in landslide monitoring.},

   PROXIES},
Journal = {FIRE ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Pages = {71-87},
Abstract = {Live fuel moisture (LFM) is an important fuel property controlling fuel
   ignition and fire propagation. LFM varies seasonally, and is controlled
   by precipitation, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and plant
   physiology. LFM is typically sampled manually in the field, which leads
   to sparse measurements in space and time. Use of LFM proxies could
   reduce the need for field sampling while potentially improving spatial
   and temporal sampling density. This study compares soil moisture and
   remote sensing data to field-sampled LFM for Gambel oak (Quercus
   gambelii Nutt) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt) in northern
   Utah. Bivariate linear regression models were constructed between LFM
   and four independent variables. Soil moisture was more strongly
   correlated with LFM than remote sensing measurements, and produced the
   lowest mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted LFM values at most of the
   sites. When sites were pooled, canopy water content (CWC) had stronger
   correlations with LFM than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   or normalized difference water index (NDWI). MAE values for all proxies
   were frequently above 20 \% LFM at individual sites. Despite this
   relatively large error, remote sensing and soil moisture data may still
   be useful for improving understanding of spatial and temporal trends in
   LFM.},

Abstract = {The availability of high sensitivity temperature sensors (0.001 K
   sensitivity platinum resistors), which can be positioned at intervals of
   a few centimeters along a vertical profile in the unsaturated zone,
   allows short-term in situ determinations-one day or even less-of the
   thermal diffusivity. The development of high data storage capabilities
   also makes this possible over long periods and the relative variations
   in thermal diffusivity allow the monitoring of the variations in water
   content. The processing of temperature measurements recorded at
   different depths is achieved by solving the heat equation, using the
   finite elements method, with both conductive and convective heat
   transfers. A first set of measurements has allowed this approach to be
   validated. Water content variations derived from thermal diffusivity
   values are in excellent agreement with TDR measurements carried out on
   the experimental site at Boissy-le-Chatel (Seine et Marne, France).},

Title = {A Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse Sensor with Rigid Probes for Improved Soil Water
   Content Measurement},
Journal = {SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {79},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1059-1072},
Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {The dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method is attractive for measuring soil
   thermal properties and volumetric water content. The purpose of this
   study was to develop and test a DPHP sensor having rigid probes made
   from thick-walled stainless steel tubing (2.38-mm outside diameter). The
   probes of this sensor are much more resistant to deflection than those
   of conventional DPHP sensors, decreasing measurement error caused by
   probe deflection during insertion into the soil. Laboratory experiments
   were conducted across a wide range of saturation levels with glass beads
   and three soils of different textures. For inferring soil properties
   from the proposed sensor, we applied the recently developed identical
   cylindrical perfect conductors (ICPC) model instead of the infinite line
   source (ILS) model that is typically used. The ICPC model improves
   solution for heat transport through the probe-soil system by accounting
   for the heat capacity and radius of the probes. Our results show a root
   mean square error of 1.4\% volumetric water content and elimination of
   the measurement bias typically encountered with DPHP measurements. We
   conclude that the improved sensor, in combination with the ICPC model,
   provides a general, soil-independent water content estimate that is
   especially suitable for field soil water content monitoring because of
   its robust design with rigid probes. Because of its simplicity and
   measurements independent of soil type, we propose the presented DPHP
   method as an excellent alternative to other available measurement
   techniques for soil water content.},

Abstract = {The field deployment of a heated distributed temperature sensor (DTS)
   for over three years has revealed two obstacles to estimating soil
   moisture () that may hamper subsurface DTS applications as well as use
   of other subsurface thermal probes. The first observed obstacle was a
   hysteretic response of the DTS sensor. The relationship between and the
   temperature response (T) within the cable was not only dependent on of
   the soil, but also on the previous wetting and drying cycles leading to
   that state. The second observed obstacle was soil structure healing.
   Soil structure healing causes the relationship between T and to evolve
   through time; this calibration curve becomes flatter, or less sensitive,
   as the surrounding soil makes better contact with the cable. Effects of
   the hysteretic response of the instrument and soil structure healing are
   largely the result of small gaps between the cable and soil. These small
   gaps can be approximated by a contact resistance between the cable and
   soil. In this article we characterize the occurrence of hysteretic and
   soil structure healing effects from field data and parameterize contact
   resistance by simulating heat transfer using a numerical modelling

Abstract = {Current methods to assess soil moisture extremes rely primarily on
   point-based in situ meteorological stations which typically provide
   precipitation and temperature rather than direct measurements of soil
   moisture. Microwave remote sensing offers the possibility of quantifying
   surface soil moisture conditions over large spatial extents. Capturing
   soil moisture anomalies normally requires a long temporal record of
   data, which most operating satellites do not have. This research
   examines the use of surface soil moisture from the AMSR-E passive
   microwave satellite to derive surface soil moisture anomalies by
   exploiting spatial resolution to compensate for the shorter temporal
   record of the satellite sensor. Four methods were used to spatially
   aggregate information to develop a surface soil moisture anomaly (SMA).
   Two of these methods used soil survey and climatological zones to define
   regions of homogeneity, based on the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) and
   the EcoDistrict nested hierarchy. The second two methods (ObShp3 and
   ObShp5) used zones defined by a data driven segmentation of the
   satellite soil moisture data. The level of sensitivity of the calculated
   SMA decreased as the number of pixels used in the spatial aggregation
   increased, with the average error reducing to less than 5\% when more
   than 15 pixels are used. All methods of spatial aggregation showed
   somewhat weak but consistent relationship to in situ soil moisture
   anomalies and meteorological drought indices. The size of the regions
   used for aggregation was more important than the method used to create
   the regions. Based on the error and the relationship to the in situ and
   ancillary data sets, the EcoDistrict or ObShp3 scale appears to provide
   the lowest error in calculating the SMA baseline. This research
   demonstrates that the use of spatial aggregation can provide useful
   information on soil moisture anomalies where satellite records of data
   are temporally short. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The Alabama Black Belt area is widespread of Vertisols that are
   generally unsuitable for conventional septic systems; nonetheless,
   systems of this type have been widely used in this region for decades.
   In order to explore alternatives for these conventional septic systems,
   a real-time soil moisture-controlled subsurface drip irrigation
   wastewater disposal system was integrated and field tested in a Houston
   Vertisol for 1 year. This automated disposal system effectively limited
   wastewater disposal during unfavorably wet drain field conditions.
   However, the resulting nutrient supply into the drain field was observed
   to be in surplus to crop growth requirements. Soil cores taken at the
   conclusion of the 1-year study indicated evidence of nitrate and
   phosphorus leaching. Available nitrates in the top 100 cm of soil showed
   a decreasing trend but were higher than all other parallel controls.
   Soil crop-available phosphorous in the soil increased below the drip
   line, as result that may be ascribed to soil cracking that was not
   properly controlled at the test site. Despite the demonstrated
   deficiencies, integrating timing of wastewater disposal with soil
   moisture conditions can supplement existing municipal or decentralized

Title = {In-situ Soil Moisture Sensing: Measurement Scheduling and Estimation
   Using Sparse Sampling},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a
   wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and
   prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements
   and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (the temporal
   evolution of soil moisture). In this article, we explore the use of
   results from the theory of sparse sampling, including Compressive
   Sensing (CS) and Matrix Completion (MC), in this application context. We
   first consider the problem of reconstructing the soil moisture process
   at a single location using CS. Our physical constraint leads to very
   sparse measurement matrices, which makes finding a suitable
   representation basis very challenging: it needs to make the underlying
   signal sufficiently sparse while at the same time being sufficiently
   incoherent with the measurement matrix, two common preconditions for CS
   techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by
   exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution and show that this
   basis attains a very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the
   signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent
   with our physical constraints. We next consider the problem of jointly
   reconstructing soil moisture processes at multiple locations, assuming
   sparse measurements can be taken at each location. We show that the
   spatial soil moisture process enjoys a low-rank property, a priority for
   MC. Accordingly, we introduce a spatiotemporal measurement matrix and
   apply the MC framework to reconstruct the soil moisture field. Extensive
   numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil
   moisture data and simulated data and through comparison with a
   closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that, for a
   single location, a uniform measurement scheduling followed by CS
   recovery results in a very nice tradeoff between estimation accuracy,
   sampling rate, flexibility, and feasibility in implementation. When
   multiple locations are available, our results show that joint
   reconstruction using MC in general produces better estimation accuracy
   than using a single location alone, but it requires the use of
   independent and random measurement schedules across locations. We also
   show that these sparse sampling techniques can be augmented so as to be
   robust against sporadic data outliers/corruption caused by, for example,
   intermittent sensor faults.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture
   evolution using a wireless network of in situ sensors. Continuously
   sampling moisture levels with these sensors incurs high-maintenance and
   energy consumption costs, which are particularly undesirable for
   wireless networks. Our main hypothesis is that a sparser set of
   measurements can meet the monitoring objectives in an energy-efficient
   manner. The underlying idea is that we can trade off some inaccuracy in
   estimating soil moisture evolution for a significant reduction in energy
   consumption. We investigate how to dynamically schedule the sensor
   measurements so as to balance this tradeoff. Unlike many prior studies
   on sensor scheduling that make generic assumptions on the statistics of
   the observed phenomenon, we obtain statistics of soil moisture evolution
   from a physical model. We formulate the optimal measurement scheduling
   and estimation problem as a partially observable Markov decision problem
   (POMDP). We then utilize special features of the problem to approximate
   the POMDP by a computationally simpler finite-state Markov decision
   problem (MDP). The result is a scalable, implementable technology that
   we have tested and validated numerically and in the field.},

Abstract = {Scouting to determine soil water status throughout a golf course or
   large athletic field complex is quite time consuming and requires
   numerous observations to characterize variability across the site. The
   objective of this research was to evaluate the use of a ground-based
   remote sensing system to predict soil water content through partial
   least squares regression analysis of canopy reflectance data collected
   from perennial ryegrass, (Lolium perenne L.) maintained at 12.7 mm and
   creeping bentgrass (Agrostis stolonifera L.) maintained at 6.3 mm during
   2002 and 2003 on a Coland silty clay loam. Volumetric soil water at a 5
   cm depth was measured by time domain reflectometry and was collected in
   conjunction with spectral radiance measurements obtained using a fiber
   optic spectrometer. Volumetric soil water content was best predicted
   with partial least squares regression analysis of creeping bentgrass
   canopy reflectance data with a maximum r(2) of 0.64 (P < 0.001) 1 d
   before development of drought stress symptoms. Similar results were
   observed for canopy reflectance data collected from perennial ryegrass
   plots, indicating that this technology and method of data analysis may
   be useful in the development of automated turfgrass irrigation
   management systems.},

Abstract = {The irrigation management based on the monitoring of the soil water
   content allows for the minimization of the amount of water applied,
   making its use more efficient. Taking into account these aspects, in
   this work, a sensor for measuring the soil water content was developed
   to allow real time automation of irrigation systems. This way, problems
   affecting crop yielding such as irregularities in the time to turn on or
   turn off the pump, and excess or deficit of water can be solved. To
   develop the sensors were used stainless steel rods, resin, and
   insulating varnish. The sensors measuring circuit was based on a
   microcontroller, which gives its output signal in the digital format.
   The sensors were calibrated using soil of the type ``Quartzarenic
   Neosoil{''}. A third order polynomial model was fitted to the
   experimental data between the values of water content corresponding to
   the field capacity and the wilting point to correlate the soil water
   content obtained by the oven standard method with those measured by the
   electronic circuit, with a coefficient of determination of 93.17\%, and
   an accuracy in the measures of +/- 0.010 kg kg(-1). Based on the
   results, it was concluded that the sensor and its implemented measuring
   circuit can be used in the automation process of irrigation systems.},

Abstract = {Advances in sensor technology continue to provide new and significant
   benefits to agriculture. An innovative approach for observing soil water
   dynamics in the subsurface is introduced using a mobile electromagnetic
   sensor prototype traveling through a horizontal PVC access tube. A
   series of tests for evaluating the prototype were designed and conducted
   to (i) determine the sensor's area of sensitivity (AOS), (ii) measure
   varied levels of soil water content along the tube and (iii) track
   temporal changes in soil water content under; (a) two drippers on a
   horizontal- and (b) multiple drippers on a sloped-soil surface (i.e., 6
   degrees slope). The AOS experiment suggested the sensor's fringing field
   extends to a radius of 5.5 cm from the pipe wall yielding an AOS of
   181.3 cm(2). Measured step-wise changes in soil water content along the
   tube were highly correlated to those of extracted core samples (R-2 =
   0.99 and RMSE = 0.012 cm(3) cm(-3)). The drip emitter tests illustrated
   spatial hydrodynamics of water infiltration around the access tube.
   These results illustrate potential applications for this sensing
   approach, yielding one-dimensional monitoring of soil water along a
   horizontal line in the root zone or deeper subsurface. Future
   developments should explore performance in longer and potentially
   curvilinear pipes for environmental and engineering applications. (C)

Title = {Monitoring Shallow Soil Water Content Under Natural Field Conditions
   Using the Early-Time GPR Signal Technique},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {It has been recently demonstrated that the early-time portion of the
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signal, consisting of the direct air and
   ground wave events, is dependent on the shallow subsurface bulk
   electromagnetic properties of the material; these properties are
   strongly controlled by the water content in this material. While several
   controlled experiments have been conducted to study the effects of water
   content variations on the antenna-material coupling, they considered a
   limited range of moisture variations and soil textures. Furthermore,
   those previous experiments did not consider highly dynamic shallow
   moisture responses that would be encountered under natural field
   conditions. For these reasons, general acceptance of this method
   requires that it be tested in real-life applications. Our paper
   evaluates the early-time GPR technique under natural field conditions
   where surface roughness, lithology, lateral heterogeneities, vegetation
   and water content dynamics are not controlled. We assess the capacity of
   the early-time amplitude technique over the complete annual cycle of
   soil moisture conditions at three textural sites. To evaluate the
   sensitivity of the early-time amplitudes to subsurface water content
   variations, we compare the early-time results acquired using the
   enveloped amplitude of the first part of GPR signals with the bulk
   dielectric permittivity obtained from concurrently collected
   common-midpoint direct ground wave velocity and gravimetric water
   content measurements. Our results demonstrate that the early-time method
   can yield near-surface permittivity information that is consistent with
   that obtained from direct ground wave velocity measurements, and
   accurate predictions of shallow soil moisture conditions.},

Abstract = {Regional soil moisture distributions and changes are critical for
   agricultural production and environmental modeling. Currently, hundreds
   of satellite sensors exist with different soil moisture observation
   capabilities. However, multi-sensor collaborative observation mechanisms
   for improving regional soil moisture monitoring capabilities are
   lacking. In this study, a Spatial pattern and Temporal variation
   law-based Multi-sensor Collaboration (STMC) method is proposed to solve
   this problem. The first component of the STMC method deduces the
   regional soil moisture distribution and variation patterns based on time
   stability theory and long-term statistical analyses. The second
   component of the STMC method detects potential anomalous soil moisture
   events and immediately triggers the high spatial resolution sensor with
   the soonest pass-over time. In the detection phase, an anomalous soil
   moisture judgment (ASMJ) algorithm and high temporal resolution sensors
   (the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2)) were utilized.
   Experiments conducted in Hubei province, China, demonstrated that the
   proposed STMC method was capable of accurately identifying of anomalous
   soil moisture conditions caused by waterlogging and drought events.
   Additionally, we observed that the STMC method combined the advantages
   of different long-term observation, high temporal, and high spatial
   resolution sensors synergistically for monitoring purposes.},

Abstract = {Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) is an inexpensive and attractive
   methodology for repeated measurements of soil water content (theta).
   Although there are some known measurement limitations for dry soil and
   sand, a fixed-frequency method is commonly used with commercially
   available FDR probes. The purpose of our study was to determine if the
   soil dielectric spectrum could be used to measure changes in theta. A
   multifrequency FDR probe was constructed with a 6-mm diameter, and a
   soil dielectric spectrum was obtained. Using the dielectric spectrum,
   the dielectric dispersion frequency (f(d)) was determined. It was
   discovered that changes in f(d) were highly correlated with changes in
   theta, and a third-order polynomial equation (R-2 = 0.96) was developed
   describing the relationship. The effectiveness of f(d) for theta
   measurement was evaluated for three soils and a sand across a range of
   theta. The effects of soil temperature and soil salinity were also
   evaluated. Accurate measurements of theta were obtained even in dry soil
   and sand. The root mean square error of the theta estimated by the f(d)
   measurement was 0.021. The soil temperature and soil salinity had no
   measureable effects on q determination. The use of f(d) for theta
   determination should be an effective and accurate methodology,
   especially when dry soils, soil temperature, and/or soil salinity could
   potentially cause problems with the theta measurements.},

Abstract = {A soil sensor to measure moisture content in soil is fabricated and
   described. The sensor is based on graphene quantum dots (GQDs) and is
   highly sensitive. The simplicity of the process and use of an
   inexpensive material GQDs make it an affordable low cost sensing unit in
   comparison to existing soil moisture sensing units. It is a resistive
   micro-sensor with interdigitated electrodes (IDE) where MEMS fabrication
   process is used and GQDs serve as the channel material between IDEs. The
   sensor is tested in two different soil environments viz. white clay
   (passive soil) and bentonite clay (an active soil). The conductance of
   IDE structure with GQDs changes from 0.06 x 10(-6) 1/Omega to 0.68 x
   10(-6) 1/Omega in white clay as the gravimetric moisture content changes
   from 4 to 45\%. For bentonite soil, the conductance of the sensor
   changes from 0.06 x 10(-6) 1/Omega to 0.48 x 10(-6) 1/Omega across the
   gravimetric moisture range of 11 to 90\%. The sensor shows higher
   sensitivity at higher moisture content which can be attributed to
   Grotthuss chain reaction and ionic conductivity. Response time of the
   fabricated micro-sensor is found to be 2-3 min which is the lowest
   response time reported for a resistive based soil moisture sensor. The
   sensitivity of sensor towards gravimetric moisture contents is 0.014 x
   10(-6) 1/Omega per percent increase in moisture content (1/Omega/1\%)

Abstract = {Drought is a complex natural disaster that occurs frequently. Soil
   moisture has been the main issue in remote monitoring of drought events
   as the most direct and important variable describing the drought.
   Spatio-temporal distribution and variation of soil moisture evidently
   affect surface evapotranspiration, agricultural water demand, etc. In
   this paper, a new simple method for soil moisture monitoring is
   developed using near-infrared versus red (NIR-red) spectral reflectance
   space. First, NIR-red spectral reflectance space is established using
   atmospheric and geometric corrected ETM+ data, which is manifested by a
   triangle shape, in which different surface covers have similar spatial
   distribution rules. Next, the model of soil moisture monitoring by
   remote sensing (SMMRS) is developed on the basis of the distribution
   characteristics of soil moisture in the NIR-red spectral reflectance
   space. Then, the SMMRS model is validated by comparison with field
   measured soil moisture data at different depths. The results showed that
   satellite estimated soil moisture by SMMRS is highly accordant with
   field measured data at 5 cm soil depth and average soil moisture at 0-20
   cm soil depths, correlation coefficients are 0.80 and 0.87,
   respectively. This paper concludes that, being simple and effective, the
   SMMRS model has great potential to estimate surface moisture conditions.},

   Microbial Fuel Cells},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Green roofs have many benefits, but in countries with semiarid climates
   the amount of water needed for irrigation is a limiting factor for their
   maintenance. The use of drought-tolerant plants such as Sedum species,
   reduces the water requirements in the dry season, but, even so, in
   semiarid environments these can reach up to 60 L m(-2) per day.
   Continuous substrate/soil water content monitoring would facilitate the
   efficient use of this critical resource. In this context, the use of
   plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs) emerges as a suitable and more
   sustainable alternative for monitoring water content in green roofs in
   semiarid climates. In this study, bench and pilot-scale experiments
   using seven Sedum species showed a positive relationship between current
   generation and water content in the substrate. PMFC reactors with higher
   water content (around 27\% vs. 17.5\% v/v) showed larger power density
   (114.6 and 82.3 mu W m(-2) vs. 32.5 mu W m(-2)). Moreover, a correlation
   coefficient of 0.95 (+/- 0.01) between current density and water content
   was observed. The results of this research represent the first effort of
   using PMFCs as low-cost water content biosensors for green roofs.},

Abstract = {Despite considerable interest in the application of land surface data
   assimilation systems (LDASs) for agricultural drought applications,
   relatively little is known about the large-scale performance of such
   systems and, thus, the optimal methodological approach for implementing
   them. To address this need, this paper evaluates an LDAS for
   agricultural drought monitoring by benchmarking individual components of
   the system (i.e., a satellite soil moisture retrieval algorithm, a soil
   water balance model, and a sequential data assimilation filter) against
   a series of linear models that perform the same function (i.e., have the
   same basic input/output structure) as the full system component.
   Benchmarking is based on the calculation of the lagged rank cross
   correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)
   and soil moisture estimates acquired for various components of the
   system. Lagged soil moisture/NDVI correlations obtained using individual
   LDAS components versus their linear analogs reveal the degree to which
   nonlinearities and/or complexities contained within each component
   actually contribute to the performance of the LDAS system as a whole.
   Here, a particular system based on surface soil moisture retrievals from
   the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), a two-layer Palmer soil water
   balance model, and an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is benchmarked.
   Results suggest significant room for improvement in each component of
   the system.},

Abstract = {Two types of Soil Vegetation Atmosphere Transfer (SVAT) modeling
   approaches can be applied to monitor root-zone soil moisture in
   agricultural landscapes. Water and Energy Balance (WEB) SVAT modeling is
   based on forcing a prognostic root-zone water balance model with
   observed rainfall and predicted evapotranspiration. In contrast, thermal
   Remote Sensing (RS) observations of surface radiometric temperature
   (T-R) are integrated into purely diagnostic RS-SVAT models to predict
   the onset of vegetation water stress. While RS-SVAT models do not
   explicitly monitor soil moisture, they can be used in the calculation of
   thermal-based proxy variables for the availability of soil water in the
   root zone. Using four growing seasons (2001 to 2004) of profile soil
   moisture, micro-meteorology, and surface radiometric temperature
   measurements at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA)
   Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancements
   (OPE3) study site in Beltsville, MD, prospects for improving WEB-SVAT
   root-zone soil water predictions via the assimilation of diagnostic
   RS-SVAT soil moisture proxy information are examined. Results illustrate
   the potential advantages of such an assimilation approach relative to
   the competing approach of directly assimilating T-R measurements. Since
   T-R measurements used in the analysis are tower-based (and not obtained
   from a remote platform), a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the
   potential impact of remote sensing limitations on the value of the
   RS-SVAT proxy. Overall, results support a potential role for RS-SVAT
   modeling strategies in improving WEB-SVAT model characterization of
   root-zone soil moisture. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Monitoring Citrus Soil Moisture and Nutrients Using an IoT Based System},
Journal = {SENSORS},

Abstract = {Chongqing mountain citrus orchard is one of the main origins of Chinese
   citrus. Its planting terrain is complex and soil parent material is
   diverse. Currently, the citrus fertilization, irrigation and other
   management processes still have great blindness. They usually use the
   same pattern and the same formula rather than considering the orchard
   terrain features, soil differences, species characteristics and the
   state of tree growth. With the help of the ZigBee technology, artificial
   intelligence and decision support technology, this paper has developed
   the research on the application technology of agricultural Internet of
   Things for real-time monitoring of citrus soil moisture and nutrients as
   well as the research on the integration of fertilization and irrigation
   decision support system. Some achievements were obtained including
   single-point multi-layer citrus soil temperature and humidity detection
   wireless sensor nodes and citrus precision fertilization and irrigation
   management decision support system. They were applied in citrus base in
   the Three Gorges Reservoir Area. The results showed that the system
   could help the grower to scientifically fertilize or irrigate, improve
   the precision operation level of citrus production, reduce the labor
   cost and reduce the pollution caused by chemical fertilizer.},

Abstract = {Passive microwave soil moisture datasets can be used as an input to
   provide an integrated assessment of climate variability as it relates to
   agricultural production. The objective of this research was to examine
   three passive microwave derived soil moisture datasets over multiple
   growing seasons in contrasting Canadian agricultural environments.
   Absolute and relative soil moisture was evaluated from two globally
   available datasets from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for
   EOS (AMSR-E) sensor using different retrieval algorithms, as well as
   relative soil wetness at a weekly scale from the Special Sensor
   Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensor. At a daily scale, the Land Parameter
   Retrieval Model (LPRM) provides a better estimate of surface soil
   moisture conditions than the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC)
   dataset, with root mean squared errors ranging from 5 to 10\% for LPRM
   and 12 to 18\% for NSIDC soil moisture when a temporal smoothing is
   applied to the dataset. Both datasets provided better estimates of soil
   moisture over the temperate site near Elora, Ontario than the prairie
   site near Davidson, Saskatchewan. The LPRM dataset tends to overestimate
   soil moisture conditions at both sites, where the NSIDC dataset tends to
   underestimate absolute soil moisture. These differences in retrieval
   methods were independent of radiometric frequency used. At weekly
   scales, the LPRM dataset provides a better relative estimate of wetness
   conditions when compared to the NSIDC and the Basist Wetness Index (BWI)
   from SSM/I data, but the SSM/I dataset did provide a reasonably good
   relative indicator of moisture conditions. The high variability in
   accuracy of soil moisture estimation related to retrieval algorithms
   indicates that consistency is needed in these datasets if they are to be
   integrated in long term studies for yield estimation or data
   assimilation.},

Title = {Soil water content monitoring for irrigation management: A
   geostatistical analysis},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {188},
Pages = {36-49},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {With the increasing attention to site-specific or variable rate
   irrigation management, it is helpful to reconsider the quantity and
   placement of soil water monitoring locations in this context. Volumetric
   soil water content (theta(v)) was monitored using a neutron probe (NP)
   at 72 locations in a center pivot irrigated field in eastern Nebraska.
   Variance reduction and temporal stability analyses were performed on
   theta(v) from shallow (similar to top 46 cm) and full profile (similar
   to 122 cm) readings for four monitoring cycles in the 2015 growing
   season and 2016 preseason. Eleven additional cycles were included for a
   subset of the data for the temporal stability analysis. The spatial
   correlation scale for theta(v) was found to be less than the closest
   spacing of monitoring locations in the study (i.e. <37 m). For this
   field site, approximately three neutron probe monitoring locations were
   required to determine mean soil water depletion (+/- 2 cm) for the field
   or for a management zone. Little economy would be gained in variance
   reduction for areal mean theta(v) from using a stratified network for
   management areas of reasonable size in a center pivot irrigated field.
   Temporally stable monitoring locations were identified. However,
   relatively low-cost spatial predictor variables, including elevation,
   deviation from mean elevation, apparent electrical conductivity, and
   mean relative difference of interpolated cosmic ray neutron probe
   surveys, were not consistent predictors of NP mean relative difference.
   The small range of variability of theta(v) within the study field is
   thought to be a contributing factor. It is possible that for fields with
   similar variability, or for site-specific irrigation where zones have
   been selected to reduce within-zone variance, that sensor quantity is
   more important than sensor placement in quantifying the areal mean
   theta(v) for irrigation management. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Drought is generally associated with the persistence of low
   precipitation amount, decreased soil moisture and water availability
   relative to the normal levels in a designated area. The effects of
   drought, range from the morphological to molecular levels, and are
   evident at all phenological stages of the plant growth, at whatever
   stage the water deficit occurs. Determination of the surface water
   demands for irrigation purposes comes out from the assumption of
   hydrologic processes stationarity. This paper shows our research
   prerequisite that water stress participates in an important part on the
   volume changes of over ground parts, which is predictive for the
   irrigation demand. Malus domestica var. Yellow Transparent was chosen
   for the measurement of volume changes of the surface plant parts. Our
   measurements were realised by the Diameter dendrometer small (DD-S) from
   24.08. to 13.09.2017. One tree was irrigated by the dose of 50 mm. We
   compared the dendrometric changes to soil moisture and rainfall on both
   irrigated and non-irrigated trees. The experiment showed the differences
   between the irrigated apple tree (the diameters of the branches
   fluctuated between 11.9 and 12.1 mm) and the non-irrigated apple tree
   (the diameter of the branches increased after three-day rain from 8.35
   to 8.61 mm), in order to determine the water stress of plants based on
   dendrometric changes and optimize irrigation during the drought period.},

Abstract = {For many years a soil water content sensor with low cost, reliability
   and sufficient accuracy has been desirable. Thus, an improved
   measurement method based on the frequency domain (FD) principle for
   determining soil water content was considered. Unlike other measurement
   principles, a new measurable index, eta, which was independent of the
   output impedance and the amplitude of the oscillator while relying on
   the electrical impedance of a multi-pin probe, was proposed. Moreover, a
   model for processing the impedance of the multi-pin soil probe was
   developed, and several important electrical parameters for establishing
   their operating ranges applicable to this probe were evaluated. In order
   to confirm the theoretical analysis, an experiment was conducted with a
   4-pin probe. Using the developed model, the relationship between the
   proposed index eta and soil volumetric water content was shown to be
   linear (R-2 = 0.9921). Thus, as the measurable index, eta seemed
   satisfactory.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of vertical distribution of the soil water content in the root

   frequency modulated continuous-wave P-band ( = 68 cm) scatterometer (SC)
   and the gamma-ray radiometer (GR) for the range of 50-3000 keV, both low
   in sensitivity to soil surface roughness and vegetation, was proposed.
   This combination allowed the determination of W at the three depth
   ranges: 0-5, 0-30, and 5-30 cm. This considerably specified the vertical
   distribution of W. Both instruments were developed as an integrated
   remote-sensing system that was installed onboard a light aircraft and
   tested on an irrigated agricultural region of the Negev desert, Israel.
   For processing and analysing the results, analytical models for both
   reflection coefficient () and intensity of the natural gamma radiation
   () were developed for various types of soils and vertical distributions
   of W. Using these models, the problem of the inverse retrieval of W was
   solved, and the depth of sampling z was evaluated. SC allowed the
   measurement of average W for the depth of 0.5-5.0 cm depending on W and
   dW/dz at the soil surface. For GR, the sampling depth varied from 20 to
   30 cm depending on the mean value of W in the top soil layer. Field
   experiments showed that W retrieved by the developed system was in good
   agreement (r(2) 0.9) with ground measurements, thus indicating
   sufficient accuracy of both instruments.},

   has been designed, built, and tested. It is shown that, with the desired

Abstract = {This paper presents the development and testing of an integrated
   low-power and low-cost dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) soil-moisture sensor
   in view of the electrical power consumed and affordability in developing
   countries. A DPHP sensor has two probes: a heater and a temperature
   sensor probe spaced 3 mm apart from the heater probe. Supply voltage of
   3.3V is given to the heater-coil having resistance of 33 Omega power
   consumption of 330 mW, which is among the lowest in this category of
   sensors. The heater probe is 40 mm long with 2 mm diameter and hence is
   stiff enough to be inserted into the soil. The parametric finite element
   simulation study was performed to ensure that the maximum temperature
   rise is between 1 degrees C and 5 degrees C for wet and dry soils,
   respectively. The discrepancy between the simulation and experiment is
   less than 3.2\%. The sensor was validated with white clay and tested
   with red soil samples to detect volumetric water-content ranging from
   0\% to 30\%. The sensor element is integrated with low-power electronics
   for amplifying the output from thermocouple sensor and TelosB mote for
   wireless communication. A 3.7V lithium ion battery with capacity of 1150
   mAh is used to power the system. The battery is charged by a 6V and 300
   mA solar cell array. Readings were taken in 30 min intervals. The
   life-time of DPHP sensor node is around 3.6 days. The sensor, encased in
   30 mm x 20 mm x 10 mm sized box, and integrated with electronics was
   tested independently in two separate laboratories for validating as well
   as investigating the dependence of the measurement of soil-moisture on
   the density of the soil. The difference in the readings while repeating
   the experiments was found out to be less than 0.01\%. Furthermore, the
   effect of ambient temperature on the measurement of soil-moisture is
   studied experimentally and computationally. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

   available soil moisture in the rooting zone of crops determine to a
   large extent the agricultural production potential of wetlands. Various
   methods exist to assess soil moisture dynamics with Frequency Domain
   Reflectometry (FDR) being among the most prominent. However, the
   suitability of FOR sensors for assessing plant available soil moisture
   has to date not been confirmed for wetland soils in the region. We
   monitored the seasonal and spatial dynamics of water availability for
   crop growth in an inland valley wetland of the Kenyan highlands using a
   FOR sensor which was site-specifically calibrated. Access tubes were
   installed within different wetland use types and hydrological situations
   along valley transects and soil properties affecting soil moisture
   (organic C, texture, and bulk density) were investigated. There was
   little variation in soil attributes between physical positions in the
   valley, and also between topsoil and subsoil attributes with the
   exception of organic C contents. With a root mean squared error of 0.073
   m(3)/m(3), the developed calibration function of the FDR sensor allows
   for reasonably accurate soil moisture prediction for both within-site
   comparisons and the monitoring of temporal soil moisture variations.
   Applying the calibration equation to a time series of profile probe
   readings over a period of one year illustrated not only the temporal
   variation of soil moisture, but also effects of land use. (C) 2013

Abstract = {Many methods have been proposed to select sites for grid-scale soil
   moisture monitoring networks; however, calibration/validation activities
   also require information about where to place grid representative
   monitoring sites. In order to design a soil moisture network for this
   task in the Great Lakes Basin (522 000 km(2)), the dual-entropy
   multiobjective optimization algorithm was used to maximize the
   information content and minimize the redundancy of information in a
   potential soil moisture monitoring network. Soil moisture retrieved from
   the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission during the
   frost-free periods of 2010-2013 were filtered for data quality and then
   used in a multiobjective search to find Pareto optimum network designs
   based on the joint entropy and total correlation measures of information
   content and information redundancy, respectively. Differences in the
   information content of SMOS ascending and descending overpasses resulted
   in distinctly different network designs. Entropy from the SMOS ascending
   overpass was found to be spatially consistent, whereas descending
   overpass entropy had many peaks that coincided with areas of high
   subgrid heterogeneity. A combination of both ascending and descending
   overpasses produced network designs that incorporated aspects of
   information from each overpass. Initial networks were designed to
   include 15 monitoring sites, but the addition of network cost as an
   objective demonstrated that a network with similar information content
   could be achieved with fewer monitoring stations.},

   extremum. Tube radius has the largest impact of any geometrical
   parameter on sampling area with increases in radius causing increases in
   sampling area. Increasing electrode separation angle increases the

   soil water content, tube dielectric, and tube radius: where increasing

Abstract = {Precision agriculture is drawing widespread attention and increasing
   interest in the use of on-the-go sensors to extract soil and plant
   information. This new trend is evident from an increased number of
   (tillage) studies concerning the development of sensors for measuring
   physical soil properties. In this study, a new dielectric-based
   horizontal sensor was designed and stationary calibrated in pots for
   measurement of volumetric soil water content. Subsequently, the sensor
   was combined with a load cell and installed on a tine with thickness of
   25 mm, and its dynamic performance was assessed. The load cell behind
   the tine measures horizontal soil mechanical resistance. In order to
   evaluate the on-the-go performance of this combined sensor, two
   experiments were carried out in a soil bin, with the purpose of (i)
   measuring soil water content along a transect of longitudinally variable
   water contents, (ii) investigating the difference in horizontal
   resistance force measured by either the combined (horizontal force and
   water content) or a single sensor (horizontal force only). The
   stationary calibration results showed that quadratic equations with
   coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.989 and 0.918 could be fitted
   to the data points obtained from measurements in soil bulk densities of
   1.5 and 1.2 g cm(-3), respectively. The results of the soil bin
   experiments indicated that the response of the dielectric sensor to soil
   water content variations was reasonable, but that the output voltage of
   the sensor should be amplified for a better sensitivity and resolution.
   The presented combined sensor can provide useful information on soil
   physical properties towards site specific applications in soils. (C)

Title = {Field and Laboratory Evaluation of the CS655 Soil Water Content Sensor},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {17},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 14},
Abstract = {Soil moisture sensors infer volumetric soil water content (SWC) from
   other properties of the bulk porous media. The CS655 water content
   reflectometer is a relatively new, low-frequency electromagnetic sensor
   that determines relative permittivity (K-a) using the two-way travel
   period and voltage attenuation of the applied signal along two 12-cm
   rods. This measured attenuation is quadratically related to bulk
   electrical conductivity (EC). Along with an onboard thermistor, the
   CS655 allows a more robust correction of propagation time and K-a, which
   its predecessors, the CS615 and CS616, lacked. However, with new sensors
   it is necessary to quantify their practical accuracy in the field. Here,
   we present an overview of the CS655 sensor and an evaluation under both
   laboratory and field conditions, using five surface soils (0-10-cm
   depth) in the laboratory and gravimetric samples collected in the field.
   Overall, a site-specific calibration using a two-term linearization of
   the SWC-K-a function reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of the
   factory-derived SWC of 0.073 and 0.043 m(3) m(-3) during batch and
   infiltration experiments, respectively, to 0.025 and 0.028 m(3) m(-3).
   Results further indicate that a soil-specific calibration additionally
   reduced the RMSE to <0.02 m(3) m(-3). Field evaluation across the Texas
   Soil Observation Network found that calibration reduced the variance
   across the network but did not affect the arithmetic mean or the RMSE
   against gravimetric sampling, which remained similar to 0.05 m(3) m(-3)
   regardless of the SWC-K-a-EC function applied. At the regional scale, a
   global calibration is sufficient.},

Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1002-1013},

Abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) plays a key role in partitioning water and
   energy fluxes at the land surface and in controlling hydrologic fluxes
   such as groundwater recharge. Despite the importance of SWC, it is not
   yet measured in an operational way at larger scales. The aim of this
   study was to investigate the potential of wireless sensor network
   technology for the near-real-time monitoring of SWC at the field and
   headwater catchment scales using the recently developed wireless sensor
   network SoilNet. The forest catchment Wustebach (similar to 27 ha) was
   instrumented with 150 end devices and 600 EC-5 SWC sensors from the
   ECH2O series by Decagon Devices. In the period between August and
   November 2009, more than six million SWC measurements were obtained. The
   observed spatial variability corresponded well with results from
   previous studies. The very low scattering in the plots of mean SWC
   against SWC variance indicates that the sensor network data provide a
   more accurate estimate of SWC variance than discontinuous data from
   measurement campaigns, due, e. g., to fixed sampling locations and
   permanently installed sensors. The spatial variability in SWC at the
   50-cm depth was significantly lower than at 5 cm, indicating that the
   longer travel time to this depth reduced the spatial variability of SWC.
   Topographic features showed the strongest correlation with SWC during
   dry periods, indicating that the control of topography on the SWC
   pattern depended on the soil water status. Interpolation results
   indicated that the high sampling density allowed capture of the key
   patterns of SWC variation.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture measurements are essential to understand land
   surface-atmosphere interactions. In this paper we evaluate the
   performance of the low-cost 10HS capacitance sensor (Decagon Devices,
   United States) using laboratory and field measurements. Measurements
   with 10HS sensors of volumetric water content (VWC, Vol.\%), integrated
   absolute soil moisture (millimeters) over the measured soil column, and
   the loss of soil moisture (millimeters) for rainless days are compared
   with corresponding measurements from gravimetric samples and time domain
   reflectometry (TDR) sensors. The field measurements were performed at
   two sites with different soil texture in Switzerland, and they cover
   more than a year of parallel measurements in several depths down to 120
   cm. For low VWC, both sensor types present good agreement for laboratory
   and field measurements. Nevertheless, the measurement accuracy of the
   10HS sensor reading (millivolts) considerably decreases with increasing
   VWC: the 10HS sensors tend to become insensitive to variations of VWC
   above 40 Vol.\%. The field measurements reveal a soil type dependency of
   the 10HS sensor performance, and thus limited applicability of
   laboratory calibrations. However, with site-specific exponential
   calibration functions derived from parallel 10HS and TDR measurements,
   the error of the 10HS compared to the TDR measurements can be decreased
   for soil moisture contents up to 30 Vol.\%, and the day-to-day
   variability of soil moisture is captured. We conclude that the 10HS
   sensor is appropriate for setting up dense soil moisture networks when
   focusing on medium to low VWC and using an established site-specific
   calibration function. This measurement range is appropriate for several
   applications in climate research, but the identified performance
   limitations should be considered in investigations focusing on humid
   conditions and absolute soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Drought is a complex phenomenon that varies in intensity over space and
   time. Due to the spatial and temporal variabilities of drought, better
   tools are required to assess its severity and spatial extent at any
   point. Because agricultural drought is influenced by several factors
   such as rainfall, soil characteristics, and crop type, we propose an
   analysis method using the soil moisture index to assess drought
   conditions. Effective drought management can be achieved using drought
   monitoring if the current conditions can be assessed and future drought
   development predicted, and decision-makers have required drought
   response operations that should be available and accessible for use in a
   short period of time and need to be updated on the latest drought
   situation. In this study, we developed a web-based geographic
   information system technology that can broadcast drought conditions in
   real-time over the Internet and can assist drought management to improve
   the quality of their decision-making and increase efficiency and
   effectiveness due to the demand for interaction between decision-makers
   in the drought management, particularly during drought response. The
   primary objective of a real-time online drought broadcast system is to
   provide real-time drought data accessibility and analysis by permitting
   access to drought's intensity, duration, patterns, and clearly
   illustrating the spatial extent of drought through the Web, and to
   contribute to better policy and decision making for drought management.
   Users can access the www graphical user interface and be able to readily
   access for current drought condition, respond to drought events more
   effectively, and provide comparisons of the current drought event to
   past events. In addition, users can obtain a daily soil moisture index
   map and evaluate the severity of the agricultural drought based on soil
   moisture changes. Our system can be used by decision-makers to assess
   current drought conditions, thereby allowing for informed drought
   management decisions. Our real time web-based drought broadcasting
   system is accessible over the web at the following URL:

Abstract = {The TRIME-FM3 (Imko GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) handheld instrument combined with the T3 access tube probe is a
   commercial soil water content (SWC) profiling system. The main purpose
   of this study was to evaluate its performance under real field
   conditions. The evaluation was performed on four sites in Tunisia and
   France where several measuring campaigns were organized between 2000 and
   2002. Reference SWC measurements also taken systematically. Direct
   comparisons of the corresponding data showed that a linear correction
   was generally sufficient to locally calibrate the TRIME (time domain
   reflectometry with intelligent microelements) measurements.
   Nevertheless, because of the influence of other interfering factors, a
   significant error (0.01 < RMSE < 0.07) still remained after this
   correction. As a possible alternative, the internal standard TRIME-FM3
   calibration was also examined. On the basis of our large set of data,
   new calibration coefficients were to convert the TRIME-FM3 internal
   measurement (a so-called pseudo transit time) into the displayed SWC.
   However, its general validity should be tested with other independent
   data. Several laboratory experiments were also performed: TRIME-tube
   measurements were taken on reference media and on a 10-L sample of soil
   that was monitored twice during drying from total water saturation to an
   equilibrium dry state. It was thus possible to quantify the sensitivity
   of the TRIME-tube measurement to the surrounding medium permittivity. An
   empirical formula was also established for inferring the soil
   permittivity from the TRIME tube measured pseudo transit time.},

Abstract = {In agricultural production, there is contradiction between the cost and
   accuracy of detection during the course of acquiring soil water content
   (theta) online. This conflict is one of the core issues of automatic
   water-saving irrigation technology in agriculture. At the same time,
   capacitive soil moisture sensor (CSMS) has received considerable
   attention, for it can acquire Nwith low cost and high precision, and
   meet the application requirements of wireless sensor network (WSN). But
   CSMS is vulnerable to the soil temperature (TO and salinity (S-s) in the
   measurement process. Therefore, this study took EC-5 sensor for example
   to establish water detection calibration models of soil temperature and
   salinity for single sensor, using Least Squares Support Vector Machines
   on MatLAB(LS-SVMlab) as the tool. On this basis, we explored the spatial
   variability of T-s and S-s, and then a method, which could be used to
   calibrate the output signals of sensors in multi-point network, was
   proposed based on the information-sharing (T-s or S-s) technology of
   WSN. Through laboratory experiment, we effectively reduced the impact of
   soil temperature and salinity on the single sensor. In example analysis,
   we investigated the detection precision and costs under different
   information-sharing radiuses (r). And the results indicated that the
   method we proposed based on the information-sharing technology of WSN
   could successfully calibrate the influence of soil temperature and
   salinity on sensors in multi-point network, and it was an efficacious
   approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy of
   moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. For
   example, while the calibration precision of soil temperature and
   salinity is respectively 1\%, the costs can be reduced by 30\%. (C) 2011

Abstract = {Precise and region-wide information about soil moisture with a high
   spatial resolution is required for river flood plains to fulfil
   statutory provisions from the EU Water Framework Directive. Influenced
   by constraints like precipitation and vegetation cover, this complex
   parameter is often measured point-by-point. Continuous soil moisture
   products derived from remote sensing are currently available only at
   coarse spatial resolutions. In this context, plants are of special
   interest, as their growth and distribution is determined by soil
   properties. Plant characteristics can be utilized as indicators or
   proxies of mean soil moisture. This study focuses on the derivation of
   top soil layer moisture content based on these indicator values by
   synergistically utilizing different methods and active as well as
   passive sensors. Subsequently, a joint model was developed to derive a
   high spatial resolution soil moisture product for the investigated
   wetlands. This model reached a coefficient of determination of 0.93. The
   result is valuable to many different user groups like water or nature
   conservation authorities of all administrative levels. The
   implementation is mainly based on Sentinel-1 and -2 along with Landsat
   data sets. The high repetition rate of the Sentinel sensors can increase
   the classification accuracy of the bio-indicators by a precise mapping
   of the phenological stages. The results indicate that the method is
   transferable to other riparian areas to a certain degree. In addition, a
   time series analysis covering a period of 16 years based on a soil
   moisture index derived from Landsat data sets was realized. Changes in
   soil moisture, following restoration measures, emerge clearly and thus
   allow for a remote sensing-based monitoring of restoration success.},

Abstract = {The ground-based University of Florida L-band Automated Radar System
   (UF-LARS) was developed to obtain observations of normalized radar
   backscatter (sigma(0)) at high temporal resolution for soil moisture
   applications. The system was mounted on a 25 m manlift with capabilities
   of antenna positioning for multi-angle data acquisition and ranging. The
   RF subsystem of UF-LARS was based upon the established designs for
   ground-based scatterometers employing a vector network analyzer with
   simultaneous acquisition of V-and H-polarized returns. System
   integration and automated data acquisition were enabled using a software
   control system. Fifteen-minute observations of sigma(0) collected over a
   growing season of sweet-corn and bare soil conditions in North Central
   Florida, were used to study the sensitivity of sigma(0) to growing
   vegetation and near-surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture (SM0-5). On average,
   sigma(0)(VV) were observed to be 23\% higher than sigma(0)(HH) during
   the mid-and late-stages of crop growth due to the vertical structure of
   stems. The correlation between 3-day observations of SM0-5 and s(VV)(0)
   reduced by 55\% compared to those obtained for <= 30-min observations.
   These findings suggested that data set at high temporal frequencies can
   be used to develop more realistic and robust forward backscattering
   models.},

Abstract = {In this study, a soil monitoring system for a hillslope with steep
   relief and shallow soil depth was designed and installed to represent
   efficiently the spatial and temporal features of soil moisture. The
   study was conducted on a mountainous hillslope of the Sulmachun
   catchment (northeastern South Korea). The positions of soil moisture
   sensors were determined through a sequential procedure including
   intensive geomorphologic surveying of the study area, surface and
   subsurface terrain analysis, and inverse surveying. Using 26 sensors,
   soil moisture data from 11 locations were measured and recorded at
   hourly intervals over 380 h from 6 to 22 November 2003. Soil moisture
   response patterns were captured for a few consecutive rainfall events.
   The monitoring results are discussed in the context of soil moisture
   variations with terrain attributes. The immediate recharge and fast
   recession after a peak are the primary features of soil moisture in the
   upper zone. Stability and significant storage increase are distinct
   characteristics of soil moisture in the buffer zone and the flow path
   zone respectively. Spatial distribution of temporal soil moisture
   variations can be characterized in terms of recession, stability and
   recharge depending upon the topographic classification of a hillslope
   for this approach. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In various agricultural activities, such as irrigation scheduling,
   tillage operation and nutrient management, soil water content is
   regarded as an essential parameter. For the demand of monitoring soil
   water dynamics at field scale, this study presents a solar-powered
   wireless cell that contained a water content sensor, two temperature
   sensors, an optical sensor, a communication module and a data-logger. To
   evaluate its feasibility in the field, three cells were independently
   installed in a bare plot, a maize plot and a sugarbeet plot in the
   summer of 2008. By a heavy rain event (20 mm, 6 h) during the
   experimental period, different responses of soil water content sensors
   were dynamically recorded and then analyzed under each canopy condition.
   In addition, to explore the possibility of reducing the dimensions of
   the cell under the condition of sufficient energy supply, various sizes
   of the solar panel were tested. The experimental results showed that the
   cell is promising to become a node of wireless network in the field. (c)

Abstract = {The volumetric soil water content (theta) is fundamental to agriculture
   because its spatiotemporal variation in soil affects the growth of
   plants. Unfortunately, the universally accepted thermogravimetric method
   for estimating volumetric soil water content is very labour intensive
   and time-consuming for use in field-scale monitoring. Electromagnetic
   (EM) induction instruments have proven to be useful in mapping the
   spatiotemporal variation of theta. However, depth-specific variation in
   theta, which is important for irrigation management, has been little
   explored. The objective of this study was to develop a relationship
   between theta and estimates of true electrical conductivity (sigma) and
   to use this relationship to develop time-lapse images of soil theta
   beneath a centre-pivot irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop in
   San Jacinto, California, USA. We first measured the bulk apparent
   electrical conductivity (ECa - mS/m) using a DUALEM-421 over a period of
   12 days after an irrigation event (i.e. days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12).
   We used EM4Soil to generate EM conductivity images (EMCIs). We used a
   physical model to estimate theta from sigma, accounting for soil
   tortuosity and pore water salinity, with a cross-validation RMSE of 0.04
   cm(3)/cm(3). Testing the scenario where no soil information is
   available, we used a three-parameter exponential model to relate theta
   to sigma and then to map theta along the transect on different days. The
   results allowed us to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of theta
   across the surveyed area, over the 12-day period. In this regard, we
   were able to map the soil close to field capacity (0.27 cm(3)/cm(3)) and
   approaching permanent wilting point (0.03 cm(3)/cm(3)). The time-lapse
   theta monitoring approach, developed using EMCI, has implications for
   soil and water use and management and will potentially allow farmers and
   consultants to identify inefficiencies in water application rates and
   use. It can also be used as a research tool to potentially assist
   precision irrigation practices and to test the efficacy of different
   methods of irrigation in terms of water delivery and efficiency in water
   use in near real time.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role for many hydrological
   applications including water resources, drought analysis, agriculture,
   and climate variability and extremes. SM is not measured in most parts
   of Iran and limited measurements do not meet sufficient temporal and
   spatial resolution. Hence, due to ease of operation, their global
   coverage and demonstrated accuracy, use of remote sensing SM products is
   almost the only way for deriving SM information in Iran. In the present
   research, surface SM (SSM) datasets at six subregions of Iran with
   different climate conditions were extracted from two satellite based
   passive (SMOSL3) and active + passive (ESA CCI SM) microwave
   observations, and two reanalysis (ERA-Interim and ERA-Interim/Land)
   products. Time series of averaged monthly mean SSM products and in situ
   ground precipitation and temperature measurements were derived for each
   subregion. Results revealed that, generally, all SSM products were in
   good agreement with each other with correlation coefficients higher than
   0.5. The better agreement was found in the Northeast and Southwest
   region with average correlation values equal to 0.88 and 0.91,
   respectively. It should be noted that the SSM datasets are characterized
   by different periods and lengths. Hence, results should be assessed with
   cautious. Moreover, most SSM products have strong correlations with
   maximum, minimum and average temperature as well as with total monthly
   precipitation. Also, trend analysis showed no trend for time series of
   monthly SSM over all subregions in the two periods 1980-1999 and
   2000-2014. The only exceptions were the Southeast subregion for
   ERA-Interim and Center and Northwest subregions for the ESA CCI SM for
   which a negative trend was detected for the period 2000-2014. Finally,
   the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) calculated from ERA-Interim,
   ERA-I/Land and ESA CCI SM datasets showed that the Center and Southeast
   regions suffered from the most severe and longest-lasting drought events
   in the last decade. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This paper quantifies the relationship between forward scattered L-band
   Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals, recorded by the
   Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation and
   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture (SM). Although
   designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing, the CYGNSS receivers
   also record GNSS reflections over land. The CYGNSS observations of
   reflection power are compared to SMAP SM between March 2017 and February
   2018. A strong, positive linear relationship exists between changes in
   CYGNSS reflectivity and changes in SMAP SM, but not between the absolute
   magnitudes of the two observations. The sensitivity of CYGNSS
   reflectivity to SM varies spatially and can be used to convert
   reflectivity to estimates of SM. The unbiased root-mean-square
   difference between daily averaged CYGNSS-derived SM and SMAP SM is
   0.045cm(3)/cm(3) and is similarly low between CYGNSS and in situ SM.
   These results show that CYGNSS, and future GNSS reflection missions,
   could provide global SM observations.},

Abstract = {Soil spatial heterogeneity poses a challenge to accurate soil moisture
   determination. Remote sensing, in particular, using sensors that acquire
   data at microwave frequencies, is being used to overcome this challenge.
   In situ soil moisture monitoring can be used to validate remotely sensed
   surface soil moisture estimates and as inputs for agronomic and
   hydrologic models. Nine in situ soil moisture stations were established
   in Manitoba (Canada) and instrumented with Stevens Hydra Probes. The
   sensors were installed in triplicate with vertical orientation at the
   surface and with horizontal orientation at the 5-, 20-, 50-, and 100-cm
   depths. To ensure accuracy of the measured soil moisture, both
   laboratory and field calibrations were conducted. These calibrated soil
   moisture values were compared with the probe default values and those
   generated using published calibrations. Overall, the results showed that
   the field calibration was superior (coefficient of determination r(2) of
   0.95) to the laboratory calibration (r(2) of 0.89). In addition,
   coarse-textured sites generally performed better than the fine-textured,
   high cation exchange capacity (CEC) sites. At the Kelburn site with high
   clay and CEC, the use of field calibration reduced the root mean square
   error from 0.188 to 0.026 m(3) m(-3). However, at the low clay and CEC
   Treherne site, gains in accuracy were minimal, about 0.005 m(3) m(-3).
   The laboratory calibration consistently underestimated soil moisture at
   all the evaluation sites, whereas both Topp and Logsdon calibrations
   overestimated soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Sensor-based feedback control irrigation systems have been increasingly
   explored for greenhouse applications. However, the relationships between
   microclimate variation, plant water usage, and growth are not well
   understood. A series of trials were conducted to investigate the
   microclimate variations in different greenhouses and whether a soil
   moisture sensor-based system can be used in monitoring and controlling
   irrigation in greenhouse crop productions. Ocimum basilicum `Genovese
   Gigante' basil and Campanula portenschlagiana `Get Mee' bellflowers were
   monitored using soil moisture sensors for an entire crop cycle at two
   commercial greenhouses. Significant variations in greenhouse
   microclimates were observed within the two commercial greenhouses and
   within an older research greenhouse. Evaporation rates were measured and
   used as an integrated indicator of greenhouse microclimate conditions.
   Evaporation rates varied within all three greenhouses and were almost
   double the lowest rates within one of the greenhouses, suggesting
   microclimates within a range of greenhouses. Although these microclimate
   variations caused large variations in the growing substrate water
   contents of containers within the greenhouses, the growth and quality of
   the plants were unaffected. For example, no significant correlations
   were observed between the growth of bellflower plants and the average
   volumetric water content (VWC), minimum VWC, or maximum VWC of the
   growing substrate. The change in VWC at each irrigation (DVWC), however,
   was positively correlated with the fresh weight, dry weight, and growth
   index (GI) of the bellflowers. For basil, no significant correlations
   were observed between plant growth and DVWC. This suggests that
   sensor-based feedback irrigation systems can be used for greenhouse crop
   production when considerations are given to factors such as the
   magnitude of microclimate variation, crop species and its sensitivity to
   water stress, and growing substrate.},

Year = {2007},
Volume = {45},

Abstract = {An understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of soil water
   extraction by trees in agroforestry systems has long been seen as an
   important step towards understanding their functioning. Traditional
   methods of soil moisture monitoring have been employed with some success
   but limitations in utilising them efficiently across both time and space
   have led to restrictions in their use. An electromagnetic induction
   (EMI) technique has been evaluated and used to study the patterns of
   soil water extraction from a Grey Vertosol in fallow or cropped fields
   alongside a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak near Warra, Qld (26.93
   degrees S, 150.93 degrees E). This technique provides methods for
   minimising error caused by seasonal variations in temperature and the
   vertical distributions of both soil water and temperature. The
   calibration developed in this study was successful in describing the
   observed variations in total soil moisture in the surface 0.9m of the
   soil pro. le (R-2 = 0.93, s.e.= 15.3 mm). We conclude that EMI

Title = {A critical review of soil moisture measurement},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Soil moisture content has paramount importance in dictating engineering,
   agronomic, geological, ecological, biological and hydrological
   characteristics of the soil mass. Though earlier researchers have
   employed various techniques of moisture content determination of soils,
   both in laboratory and in situ conditions, ascertaining the
   applicability of these techniques to soils of entirely different
   characteristics and the `types of moisture content', which they can
   measure, is still a point of debate. As such, a critical review of all
   the established and emerging soil moisture measurement techniques with
   respect to their merits and demerits becomes necessary. With this in
   view, efforts have been made in this paper to critically evaluate all
   the soil moisture measurement techniques, limitations associated with
   them and the influence of various soil-specific parameters (viz.,
   mineralogy, salinity, porosity, ambient temperature, presence of the
   organic matter and matrix structure of the soil) on the measured soil
   moisture content. This paper also highlights the importance of various
   innovations based on Micro Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) and
   nano-sensors that are emerging in this context. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {A moisture microsensor based on
   poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene-poly(styrene-sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS)
   conductive polymer is developed and presented in this paper. The change
   in electrical characteristics of the PEDOT-PSS polymer film is used to
   determine its sensitivity and working mechanism when exposed to
   different levels of moisture content. The output characteristics, the
   change in electrical sheet resistance of the PEDOT-PSS film versus the
   percentage change in relative humidity (\%RH), show that the
   conductivity of the film decreases when it is exposed to increasing
   levels of moisture content. The moisture sensors thus fabricated based
   on the PEDOT-PSS thin film were used to detect the gravimetric water
   content present in highly plastic (CH) soil samples (Buckshot Clay) for
   geological and geotechnical engineering applications. The Fourier
   transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) study of the PEDOT-PSS film on a
   glass substrate showed the incorporation of OH molecules in the film
   when it was exposed to moisture environment. This incorporation of OH
   molecules caused the change in resistance of the PEDOT-PSS film when
   exposed to moisture content. The change in the output resistance of the
   sensor device was observed to be from 2.5 to 4.0 M ohm when exposed to
   soil samples with 15-35\% change in gravimetric water content. (C) 2007

   Measuring Soil Water Content},
Journal = {SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {76},
Number = {6},
Pages = {1929-1937},

Abstract = {Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established electromagnetic
   technique used to measure soil water content. Time domain reflectometry
   sensors have been combined with heat pulse sensors to produce thermo-TDR
   sensors. Thermo-TDR sensors are restricted to having relatively short
   needles to accurately measure soil thermal properties. Short needle
   lengths, however, can limit the accuracy of the TDR measurement of soil
   water content. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors are an
   alternative to TDR sensors that can provide an inexpensive measurement
   of soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine
   whether short FDR sensors can accurately measure soil water content. We
   designed and constructed a short FDR sensor. For four soil types across
   a range of water contents, temperatures, and salt contents, we measured
   soil dielectric spectra with the short FDR sensor. A vector network
   analyzer was used to obtain soil dielectric spectra in the 1-MHz to
   3-GHz frequency range. The ideal frequency of a short FDR sensor is the
   frequency at which the permittivity is not altered by changing
   temperature or salt content. The 47- to 200-MHz range was an ideal
   frequency range for measuring soil water content, and 70 MHz was the
   frequency least influenced by temperature and salt content. The short
   FDR sensor provided quick, continuous, stable, and cheap measurements of
   soil water content. Because of the promising performance of the short
   thermo-FDR sensor in laboratory studies, sensors should be evaluated in
   future field studies.},

Abstract = {Here we report the first potentiometric sensor for soil moisture
   analysis by bringing in the concept of Galvanic cells wherein the redox
   energies of Al and conducting polyaniline are exploited to design a
   battery type sensor. The sensor consists of only simple architectural
   components, and as such they are inexpensive and lightweight, making it
   suitable for on-site analysis. The sensing mechanism is proved to be
   identical to a battery type discharge, reaction wherein polyaniline
   redox energy changes from the conducting to the nonconducting state with
   a resulting voltage shift in the presence of soil moisture. Unlike the
   state of the art soil moisture sensors, a signal derived from the
   proposed moisture sensor is probe size independent, as it is
   potentiometric in nature and, hence, can be fabricated in any shape or
   size and can provide a consistent output signal under the strong
   aberration conditions often encountered in soil moisture analysis. The
   sensor is regenerable by treating with 1 M HCl and can be used for
   multiple analysis with little read out hysteresis, Further, a portable
   sensor is fabricated which can provide warning signals to the end user
   when the moisture levels in the kill go below critically low levels,
   thereby functioning as a smart device. As the sensor is inexpensive,
   portable, potentiometric, it opens up avenues for developing effective
   and energy efficient irrigation strategies, understanding the heat and
   water transfer at the atmosphere land interface, understanding soil
   mechanics, forecasting the risk of natural calamities, and so on.},

Journal = {TRANSACTIONS OF THE ASABE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {62},
Number = {2},
Pages = {363-370},
Abstract = {One of the methods for irrigation scheduling is to use sensors to
   measure the soil moisture level in the plant root zone and apply water
   if there is a water shortage for the plants. The measurement accuracy
   and reliability of the soil moisture sensors are critical for
   sensor-based irrigation management. This study evaluated the measurement
   accuracy and repeatability of the EC-5 and 5TM soil volumetric water
   content (SVWC) sensors, the MPS-2 and 200SS soil water potential (SWP)
   sensors, and the 200TS soil temperature sensor. Six 183 cm x 183 cm x 71
   cm wooden compartments were built inside a greenhouse, and each
   compartment was filled with one type of soil from the Mississippi Delta.
   A total of 66 sensors with 18 data loggers were installed in the soil
   compartments to measure SVWC, SWP, and soil temperature. Soil samples
   were periodically collected from the compartments to determine SVWC
   using the gravimetric method. SVWC measured by the sensors was compared
   with that determined by the gravimetric method. The SVWC readings from
   the sensors had a linear regression relationship with the gravimetric
   SVWC (r(2) = 0.82). This relationship was used to calibrate the sensor
   readings. The SVWC and SWP sensors could detect the general trend of
   soil moisture changes. However, their measurements varied significantly
   among the sensors. To obtain accurate absolute soil moisture
   measurements, the sensors require individual and soil-specific
   calibration. The 5TM, MPS-2, and 200TS sensors performed well in soil
   temperature measurement tests. Individual temperature readings from
   these sensors were very close to the mean of all sensor readings.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Studies show that the performance of soil water content monitoring
   (SWCM) sensors is affected by soil physical and chemical properties.
   However, the effect of organic matter on SWCM sensor responses remains
   less understood. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to (i)
   assess the effect of organic matter on the accuracy and precision of
   SWCM sensors using a commercially available soil water content
   monitoring sensor; and (ii) account for the organic matter effect on the
   sensor's accuracy. Sand columns with seven rates of oven-dried sawdust
   (2\%, 4\%, 6\%, 8\%, 10\%, 12\% and 18\% v/v, used as an organic matter
   amendment), thoroughly mixed with quartz sand, and a control without
   sawdust were prepared by packing quartz sand in two-liter glass
   containers. Sand was purposely chosen because of the absence of any
   organic matter or salinity, and also because sand has a relatively low
   cation exchange capacity that will not interfere with the treatment
   effect of the current work. Sensor readings (raw counts) were monitored
   at seven water content levels (0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.18, 0.24,
   and 0.30 cm(3) cm(-3)) by uniformly adding the corresponding volumes of
   deionized water in addition to the oven-dry one. Sensor readings were
   significantly (p < 0.05) affected by the organic matter level and water
   content. Sensor readings were strongly correlated with the organic
   matter level (R-2 = 0.92). In addition, the default calibration equation
   underestimated the water content readings at the lower water content
   range (<0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)), while it overestimated the water content at
   the higher water content range (>0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)). A new polynomial
   calibration equation that uses raw count and organic matter content as
   covariates improved the accuracy of the sensor (RMSE = 0.01 cm(3)
   cm(-3)). Overall, findings of this study highlight the need to account
   for the effect of soil organic matter content to improve the accuracy
   and precision of the tested sensor under different soils and
   environmental conditions.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Moisture content determination in agriculture and civil engineering is a
   common process which needs special sensors with high accuracy,
   durability and compatibility with the measurement environment. A new
   1.4-GHz soil moisture sensor using microstrip transmission line is
   presented. The proposed sensor consists of two separate parts: (1) A
   sensor head, which is a microstrip transmission line to be placed in the
   soil, and (2) an electronic transceiver which sends a sinusoidal wave
   into the sensor head at one end of the transmission line, and receives
   the traveled wave from the other end. Transmitter is basically a
   Colpitts oscillator, and the receiver is a phase detector that measures
   the phase shift due to velocity variation caused by the moisture content
   of soil. At a certain frequency, the velocity of a microwave traveling
   through a media depends on the permittivity of that media. The proposed
   sensor is implemented and tested on one sample of typical soil. The main
   advantages of the proposed sensor are its high accuracy, quickness of
   measurement, its low cost and ease of implementation. Since the sensor
   has low power consumption, it can be recommended for low-power
   applications such as wireless sensor network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All

Pages = {64-74},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The aim of this paper was to test the capability of thermal remote
   sensing in monitoring waterlogged areas in Ismailia governorate based on
   surface soil moisture retrieval. Three landsat satellite images 5, 7 and
   8 (TM, ETM + and TIRS) were used for this purpose during three different
   dates (1998, 2008 and 2015). Soil moisture index (SMI) was produced
   based on calculated Land surface temperature (LST). Fifty five soil
   profiles have been dug to measure the depth of water tables of the study
   area. SMI Validation was carried out in 2015 using surface soil samples
   from the upper 5 cm in which actual moisture content was estimated.
   Digital change detection techniques for SMI were applied in order to
   monitor the change in the surface soil moisture along two time periods
   (1998-2008), (2008-2015). The results indicated that the spatio-temporal
   variations of soil moisture content are associated with soil texture,
   landuse/landcover, soil elevation and water table levels. Correlation
   between actual and retrieved soil moisture revealed a moderate
   correlation relationship with R-2 = 0.61. Furthermore, an increase of
   water table eastern the study area. Also the results illustrated the
   increasing of water table is a direct relation with soil moisture. In
   addition, an increase in the surface soil moisture (SSM) recognized in
   22.06\% of the study area from 1998 to 2008 while, 40.55\% of the area
   showed an increased in the SSM from 2008 to 2015. This continuous
   increase in the SSM could be prone to the increasing agricultural
   expansion and water table levels which, led to conversion of sabkhas to
   water bodies and fish farms. SMI could be an effective tool in mapping
   waterlogged areas.},

Abstract = {Coal mining activity in the area of high ground-water level will lead to
   the destruction, such as ground water and surface slopes. Therefore,
   crop growth and resident life will be seriously affected by the unevenly
   soil moisture distribution in this area. It is of important realistic
   significance to monitor soil moisture in the mining subsidence area with
   high phreatic water level quickly and accurately at the large-scale.
   Learning from the experience of remote sensing monitoring of soil
   moisture, this article analyzes the variation relationship between the
   spectral data and soil moisture, which are measured in the field
   surveying and measured the same field-collected samples indoor
   respectively. The sensitive bands are found according to this
   relationship and a remote sensing inversion model of the soil moisture
   is established. Based on TM image, the S-curve optimal model is
   performed to acquire the soil moisture of the subsidence area. The
   results show that the spatial distribution of the soil moisture in
   mining subsidence area with high phreatic water level can be obtained
   quickly through remote sensing inversion by using this S-curve optimal

Journal = {NEAR SURFACE GEOPHYSICS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {6},
Number = {2},
Pages = {123-132},

Abstract = {We explore the viability of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to
   quantify soil water content in a full-scale dike model. While ERT is an
   established method to detect changes in soil water content, the
   retrieval of two-dimensional water content distributions from
   surface-based surveys is a much more challenging application. We
   conducted a series of experiments on a full-scale dike model comprising
   rainfall and flooding events. The dike was surveyed with an ERT line
   down the land-side slope and monitored with permanently installed
   spatial time-domain reflectometry (TDR) cables for comparison. Water
   content changes were calculated by applying Archie's equation and agreed
   well with comparison measurements from spatial TDR measurements. The
   saturation exponent in Archie's equation was estimated by combining
   spatial TDR and ERT measurements and agreed well with literature data of
   comparable sands. The choice of the inversion type, e.g., time-lapse
   inversion or least-squares versus robust constraint, as well as the
   influence of inversion parameters, such as regularization and the choice
   of convergence criterion, is discussed in the context of an apparent

Abstract = {Triple collocation (TC) is routinely used to resolve approximated linear
   relationships between different measurements (or representations) of a
   geophysical variable that are subject to errors. It has been utilized in
   the context of calibration, validation, bias correction, and error
   characterization to allow comparisons of diverse data records from
   various direct and indirect measurement techniques including in situ
   remote sensing and model-based approaches. However, successful
   applications of TC require sufficiently large numbers of coincident data
   points from three independent time series and, within the analysis
   period, homogeneity of their linear relationships and error structures.
   These conditions are difficult to realize in practice due to infrequent
   spatiotemporal sampling of satellite and ground-based sensors. TC can,
   however, be generalized within the framework of instrumental variable
   (IV) regression theory to address some of the conceptual constraints of
   TC. We review the theoretics of IV and consider one possible strategy to
   circumvent the three-data constraint by use of lagged variables (LV) as
   instruments. This particular implementation of IV is suitable for
   circumstances where multiple data records are limited and the
   geophysical variable of interest is sampled at time intervals shorter
   than its temporal correlation length. As a demonstration of utility, the
   LV method is applied to microwave satellite soil moisture data sets to
   recover their errors over Australia and to estimate temporal properties
   of their relationships with in situ and model data. These results are
   compared against standard two-data linear estimators and the TC
   estimator as benchmark.},

Abstract = {Soil spatial variability is a key point for the sustainable water
   management in agriculture. Fractal techniques provide proper tools to
   analyze soil spatial variability searching for statistical
   self-similarity patterns among different scales. Although they have been
   extensively applied to study the soil properties variability, its
   applicability for the soil water content (SWC) distribution is
   complicated because requires many data difficult to obtain with the
   typical point soil water sensors. Recently, a fiber optic distributed
   temperature sensor has been used to measure soil thermal properties
   which relate to SWC. These sensors provide large amount of data with
   high spatial and temporal resolution, thus filling the gap of point soil
   water sensors. In the present work, soil temperature was measured with a
   Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and SWC was estimated by different
   fitting functions which have been studied with focus on spatial
   variability.
   Temperature was measured in a 133 m fiber optic cable laid in a sandy
   soil field plot. A The Active Heat Fiber Optic (AHFO) method was used,
   with 12 cm sampling resolution, and heat pulses (19,4 W/m during 2 min)
   were applied. The temperature data were correlated to SWC, considering
   the integration of temperature during the heat pulse T-cum, and then the
   datasets Tcum-SWC were fitted to the best fit statistical function
   (exponential, potential and polynomial). The results showed that the
   T-cum distribution presented a non-Gaussian pattern. Additionally,
   highly anti-persistent patterns have been detected for the larger
   spatial scaling lags. The function's performance was different thus, the
   exponential function reproduced better the absolute moments of the
   temperature profile but it failed reproducing the non-Gaussian behavior.},

Abstract = {Despite numerous applications of time domain reflectometry (TDR),
   serious difficulties in estimating accurate soil water contents under
   field conditions remain, especially in fine-textured soils. A complex
   dielectric mixing model was calibrated for fine-textured soils (24-45\%
   clay) and its accuracy was evaluated and compared with empirical
   calibrations. The Ap and Bt horizons of two soils were packed into
   columns and adjusted to volumetric water contents (theta) ranging from
   air dry to near saturation. Travel time and bulk electrical conductivity
   (sigma(0)) were measured using TDR at temperatures (T) of 8, 22, and 40
   degrees C and using three coaxial cables to obtain a range of input
   spectrum bandwidths (omega(S)). Apparent permittivities (K-a) were
   predicted using the complex permittivity model with measured theta, T,
   sigma(0), omega(S), and soil bulk density, and fitted to measured K-a by
   optimizing specific surface area (A(s)), the power-law exponent (a), and
   an empirical polarization loss factor. Measured K-a was best
   approximated using the power-law dielectric mixing model with a
   semiempirical effective frequency estimate and a = 0.68. Predicted A(S)
   increased with increasing clay content, cation exchange capacity, and
   measured specific surface areas. The two-parameter power-law calibration
   removed temperature bias in theta estimates and reduced the RMSE in
   theta estimates by an average of 0.006 m(3) m(-3) compared with an
   empirical calibration. Empirical models predicted field theta with
   oscillations of up to 0.022 m(3) m(-3) in phase with soil temperatures
   resulting from permittivity temperature dependencies. In contrast, the
   calibrated dielectric mixing model removed or dampened in-phase theta
   fluctuations to <0.004 m(3) m(-3), which permitted the detection of more
   subtle changes (<0.02 m(3) m(-3)) in theta.},

Abstract = {Despite numerous applications of time-domain reflectometry (TDR),
   serious difficulties remain in estimating accurate soil water contents
   under field conditions, especially in fine-textured soils. We developed
   a physically based calibration model to predict the frequency- and
   temperature-dependent complex dielectric response of soils. The model
   was used to predict frequency-dependent attenuation and a single
   ``effective{''} frequency approximation of apparent permittivity of the
   soil. Effective frequency was predicted to decline from 450 to 160 MHz
   as water contents increased from air dry to saturation. Predicted
   frequency decline was small for an input bandwidth of 130 MHz,
   reflecting that modeled polarization mechanisms associated with
   relaxation frequencies above 100 MHz were responsible for most of the
   frequency-dependent attenuation. For specific surface areas ranging from
   150 to 300 m(2) g(-1), simulations indicate that ignoring dielectric and
   conductive losses or the associated decline in effective frequency
   results in a 5 to 22\% underestimation of the apparent permittivity.
   Both the power-law and de Loor-Dobson mixing models gave a reasonable
   approximation to the measured apparent permittivity for a silty clay
   loam (34\% clay) across the entire water content range. Moreover, the
   models were able to describe the behavior of apparent permittivity in
   response to temperature for two soils with contrasting bulk electrical
   conductivity contributions to losses. These results demonstrate that
   loss mechanisms and declines in effective frequency need to be
   considered to accurately predict the soil water content of fine-textured

Title = {Soil water content estimation using a remote sensing based hybrid
   evapotranspiration modeling approach},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {50},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET) has evolved over the last 20
   years with the development of more robust energy balance approaches and
   the availability of timely remotely sensed imagery from satellite
   sensors. This has allowed the use of remote sensing for near-real time
   water management in irrigated systems in the western United States. In
   this paper a hybrid ET approach is applied to irrigated and
   non-irrigated cotton fields at the BEAREX08 experimental site using
   airborne remote sensing inputs under highly advective conditions, taking
   advantage of the available root zone soil water content measurements for
   verification of model output. The modeling approach is based on coupling
   the Two-Source-Energy Balance (TSEB) and the reflectance-based crop
   coefficient models. The TSEB model provides estimates of real crop ET
   while the reflectance-based crop coefficient approach allows for
   updating the basal crop coefficient and the interpolation and
   extrapolation of ET between the dates of remote sensing inputs
   facilitating the maintenance of a soil water balance in the root zone of
   the crop. Actual ET estimates using the TSEB model were compared with
   measured ET using eddy covariance systems deployed in four cotton fields
   during the BEAREX08 experiment. Estimates of soil water content in the
   soil profile of both irrigated and rain fed cotton fields were compared
   with measurements at different depths using neutron probe observations.
   Data assimilation techniques were applied to update soil water content
   values using estimates based on actual ET from the TSEB model. Results
   indicate that the hybrid ET modeling approach using data assimilation
   produced reliable daily ET interpolated between remote sensing
   observations and significantly improved soil water content estimates
   throughout the root zone profile compared to applying the
   crop-coefficient technique in a water balance model without the actual
   ET inputs. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Airborne hyperspectral images provide high spatial and spectral
   resolution along with flexible temporal resolution that are ideally
   suited for precision agricultural applications. In this study, we have
   explored the potential of aerial visible/infrared (VIR) hyperspectral
   imagery for characterizing soil fertility factors in midwestern
   agricultural fields. Two fields (SW and NW) in Illinois and two fields
   (GV and FO) in Missouri were considered in this study. Field data
   included hyperspectral VIR images and soil fertility parameters
   including pH, organic matter (OM), Ca, Mg, P, K, and soil electrical
   conductivity. The VIR images were geo-registered and calibrated into
   apparent reflectance values. The FO field had the highest average
   reflectance, followed by SW, GV and NW. The Illinois fields (SW and NW)
   were high in soil minerals, OM, and soil electrical conductivity. The
   measured soil fertility characteristics were modeled on first
   derivatives of the reflectance data using partial least square
   regression (PLSR). The PLSR model on derivative spectra was able to
   explain 66\% of the overall variability in soil fertility variables
   considered in this study, with a predicted residual sum of square
   (PRESS) of 0.66. The model explained a higher degree of variability in
   some of the response variables, such as Ca (82\%), Mg (72\%), Veris
   shallow (86\%), Veris deep (67\%), and OM (66\%), compared to factors
   such as pH (48\%) and EM (50\%). Analysis of the parameter estimates for
   each response variable showed that some of the wavebands, such as 625,
   652, 658, 661, 754 and 784 nm, explained a high degree of variability in
   the model, whereas a large number of wavelengths had negligible
   contribution. In conclusion, this study showed that soil fertility
   factors important for precision agriculture applications can be
   successfully modeled on hyperspectral VIR remote sensing data with
   partial least square regression models.},

Abstract = {There is a need for low-cost, high-accuracy measurement of water content
   in various materials. This study assesses the performance of a new
   microwave swept frequency domain instrument (SFI) that has promise to
   provide a low-cost, high-accuracy alternative to the traditional and
   more expensive time domain reflectometry (TDR). The technique obtains
   permittivity measurements of soils in the frequency domain utilizing a
   through transmission configuration, transmissometry, which provides a
   frequency domain transmissometry measurement (FDT). The measurement is
   comparable to time domain transmissometry (TDT) with the added advantage
   of also being able to separately quantify the real and imaginary
   portions of the complex permittivity so that the measured bulk
   permittivity is more accurate that the measurement TDR provides where
   the apparent permittivity is impacted by the signal loss, which can be
   significant in heavier soils. The experimental SFI was compared with a
   high-end 12 GHz TDR/TDT system across a range of soils at varying soil
   water contents and densities. As propagation delay is the fundamental
   measurement of interest to the well-established TDR or TDT technique;
   the first set of tests utilized precision propagation delay lines to
   test the accuracy of the SFI instrument's ability to resolve propagation
   delays across the expected range of delays that a soil probe would
   present when subjected to the expected range of soil types and soil
   moisture typical to an agronomic cropping system. The results of the
   precision-delay line testing suggests the instrument is capable of
   predicting propagation delays with a RMSE of +/-105 ps across the range
   of delays ranging from 0 to 12,000 ps with a coefficient of
   determination of r(2) = 0.998. The second phase of tests noted the rich
   history of TDR for prediction of soil moisture and leveraged this
   history by utilizing TDT measured with a high-end Hewlett Packard
   TDR/TDT instrument to directly benchmark the SFI instrument over a range
   of soil types, at varying levels of moisture. This testing protocol was
   developed to provide the best possible comparison between SFI to TDT
   than would otherwise be possible by using soil moisture as the bench
   mark, due to variations in soil density between soil water content
   levels which are known to impact the calibration between TDR's estimate
   of soil water content from the measured propagation delay which is
   converted to an apparent permittivity measurement. This experimental
   decision, to compare propagation delay of TDT to FDT, effectively
   removes the errors due to variations in packing density from the
   evaluation and provides a direct comparison between the SFI instrument
   and the time domain technique of TDT. The tests utilized three soils (a
   sand, an Acuff loam and an Olton clay-loam) that were packed to varying
   bulk densities and prepared to provide a range of water contents and
   electrical conductivities by which to compare the performance of the SFI
   technology to TDT measurements of propagation delay. For each sample
   tested, the SFI instrument and the TDT both performed the measurements
   on the exact same probe, thereby both instruments were measuring the
   exact same soil/soil-probe response to ensure the most accurate means to
   compare the SFI instrument to a high-end TDT instrument. Test results
   provided an estimated instrumental accuracy for the SFI of +/-0.98\% of
   full scale, RMSE basis, for the precision delay lines and +/-1.32\% when
   the SFI was evaluated on loam and clay loam soils, in comparison to TDT
   as the bench-mark.
   Results from both experimnts provide evidence that the low-cost SFI
   approach is a viable alternative to conventional TDR/TDT for high
   accuracy applications.},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture dynamics from local to global scales is
   essential for a wide range of applications. The field of remote sensing
   of soil moisture has expanded greatly and the first dedicated soil
   moisture satellite missions (SMOS, SMAP) were launched, and new
   missions, such as SENTINEL-1 provide long-term perspectives for land
   surface monitoring. This special issue aims to summarize the recent
   advances in soil moisture estimation from remote sensing, including
   recent advances in retrieval algorithms, validation, and applications of
   satellite-based soil moisture products. Contributions in this special
   issue exploit the estimation of soil moisture from both microwave remote
   sensing data and thermal infrared information. The validation of
   satellite soil moisture products can be very challenging, due to the
   different spatial scales of in situ measurements and satellite data.
   Some papers present validation studies to quantify soil moisture
   uncertainties. On the other hand, soil moisture downscaling schemes and
   new methods for soil moisture retrieval from GPS are also addressed by
   some contributions. Soil moisture data are used in fields like
   agriculture, hydrology, and climate sciences. Several studies explore
   the use of soil moisture data for hydrological application such as
   runoff prediction.},

Abstract = {Large area integrated soil moisture measurement results are often
   required for meteorological studies as well as for geological,
   agricultural and natural disaster research. Commonly used sensors
   measure the soil moisture locally and exhibit a strong spatial
   variability due to the heterogeneity of most land surfaces.
   The new `Free Line Sensing' technology uses existing high-voltage power
   lines to detect variations in soil moisture below the lines. The
   electromagnetic field of an additional radio-frequency signal in the
   range of 50-500 kHz on the line is influenced by changes in the electric
   properties of the soil, e.g., after rainfall. This has been simulated
   using high-frequency software, the result being that variations of
   electrical conductivity or dielectric coefficient of the soil will lead
   to a measurable effect with power line sections extending over several
   kilometres.
   Measurements have been conducted on a 13 km long high-voltage power
   line. The resulting signal is evaluated with respect to amplitude and
   phase. Measurement data demonstrate the capability of the `Free Line
   Sensor' to monitor the integrated soil moisture of the Earth's surface
   and near subsurface over the area covered by the power line. The
   resulting signal of the `Free Line Sensor' strongly responds to
   precipitation events and the following drying of the soil. Comparison
   with soil moisture data obtained from gravimetric drying of soil samples
   reveals a good agreement.},

Abstract = {Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques have become increasingly
   attractive for soil moisture evaluation thanks to their adaptability,
   low cost, and measurement accuracy. Many different TDR-based approaches
   are currently available for deriving moisture content: empirical
   calibration curve, empirical dielectric models, frequency-dependent
   dielectric mixing models, etc. Generally, TDR soil moisture measurements
   resort to multiple-rod probes, which provide good adhesion to the soil
   and ease of insertion. However, the typical configuration of such probes
   does not allow performing a short-open-load (SOL) calibration procedure,
   which is definitely necessary for retrieving accurate dielectric
   characterization from TDR waveforms. To overcome the impracticability of
   the traditional SOL calibration, in this paper, an innovative
   triple-short calibration (TSC) procedure for commercially available
   three-rod probes is proposed. First, the robustness of the TSC procedure
   is validated on well-referenced liquids, demonstrating that its
   application to TDR measurements leads to a substantial enhancement of
   the final accuracy in the evaluation of the frequency-dependent
   reflection coefficient. Successively, the TSC procedure is applied to
   TDR measurements performed on moistened sand samples. In particular, it
   is demonstrated that the proposed TSC method, applied to traditional TDR
   measurements in combination with a dielectric mixing model, leads to an
   accurate and effective moisture evaluation procedure. This goal is
   reached through an efficient optimization algorithm that minimizes the
   difference between experimental and theoretical reflection coefficients.
   Results show that the proposed strategy is a suitable candidate for
   low-cost, highly accurate, and easy-to-perform moisture content
   estimation of soils.},

Abstract = {Landscape assessment of soil moisture is critical to understanding the
   hydrological cycle at the regional scale and in broad-scale studies of
   biophysical processes affected by global climate changes in temperature
   and precipitation. Traditional efforts to measure soil moisture have
   been principally restricted to in situ measurements, so remote sensing
   techniques are often employed. Hyperspectral sensors with finer spatial
   resolution and narrow band widths may offer an alternative to
   traditional multispectral analysis of soil moisture, particularly in
   landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity. This preliminary research
   evaluates the ability of remotely sensed hyperspectral data to quantify
   soil moisture for the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW),
   Georgia. An airborne hyperspectral instrument with a short-wavelength
   infrared (SWIR) sensor was flown in 2005 and 2007 and the results were
   correlated to in situ soil moisture values. A significant statistical
   correlation (R-2 value above 0.7 for both sampling dates) for the
   hyperspectral instrument data and the soil moisture probe data at 5.08
   cm (2 inches) was determined. While models for the 20.32 cm (8 inches)
   and 30.48 cm (12 inches) depths were tested, they were not able to

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in energy and water
   partitioning in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. A reliable and
   operational algorithm is much needed to retrieve regional surface SM at
   high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we provide an operational
   framework of estimating surface SM at fine spatial resolutions (using
   visible/thermal infrared images and concurrent meteorological data)
   based on a trapezoidal space defined by remotely sensed vegetation cover
   (F-c) and land surface temperature (LST). Theoretical solutions of the
   wet and dry edges were derived to achieve a more accurate and effective
   determination of the F-c/LST space. Subjectivity and uncertainty arising
   from visual examination of extreme boundaries can consequently be
   largely reduced. In addition, theoretical derivation of the extreme
   boundaries allows a per-pixel determination of the VI/LST space such
   that the assumption of uniform atmospheric forcing over the entire
   domain is no longer required. The developed approach was tested at the
   Tibetan Plateau Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network (SMTMN)
   site in central Tibet, China, from August 2010 to August 2011 using
   Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra images.
   Results indicate that the developed trapezoid model reproduced the
   spatial and temporal patterns of observed surface SM reasonably well,
   with showing a root-mean-square error of 0.06 m(3)center dot m(-3) at
   the site level and 0.03 m(3)center dot m(-3) at the regional scale. In
   addition, a case study on 2 September 2010 highlighted the importance of
   the theoretically calculated wet and dry edges, as they can effectively
   obviate subjectivity and uncertainties in determining the F-c/LST space
   arising from visual interpretation of satellite images. Compared with
   Land Surface Models (LSMs) in Global Land Data Assimilation System-1,
   the remote sensing-based trapezoid approach gave generally better
   surface SM estimates, whereas the LSMs showed systematic
   underestimation. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the trapezoid
   method is most sensitive to field capacity and temperature but less
   sensitive to other meteorological observations and parameters.},

   season of the year 2012 in Korean Peninsula. The `leave one out

   the composite soil moisture products in estimating the soil moisture in
   ungagged locations. The control variable for comparison was the soil
   moisture products obtained by spatially interpolating the in situ soil
   moisture data measured at eight gage locations using the Ordinary
   Kriging (KR) technique. The results show that the composite soil
   moisture products are more accurate than the in situ only soil moisture
   products in estimating the soil moisture for the following cases: (1)
   when the spatial correlation of in situ soil moisture data is low. Such
   case includes when there is little rainfall and where the altitude is
   high (mountainous area) and (2) where the gage density is low or the
   area located further away from the in situ gages. For both cases, the KR
   method cannot use enough information due to the low spatial correlation
   of the in situ measurement for interpolation, while the CM method can
   take advantage of the satellite soil moisture measurement not affected
   by the spatial correlation of the in situ data.},

Abstract = {Wireless sensor networks area promising new in situ measurement
   technology for monitoring soil water content changes with a high spatial
   and temporal resolution for large areas. However, to realise sensor
   networks at the small. basin scale (e.g. 500 sensors for an area of 25
   ha), the costs for a single sensor have to be minimised. Furthermore,
   the sensor technique should be robust and operate with a low energy
   consumption to achieve a long operation time of the network. This paper
   evaluates a tow-cost soil water content sensor (ECH2O probe model EC-5,
   Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA) using laboratory as well. as field
   experiments. The field experiment features a comparison of water content
   measurements of a forest soil at 5 cm depth using TDR and EC-5 sensors.
   The laboratory experiment is based on a standardized sensor
   characterisation methodology, which uses liquid standards with a known
   dielectric permittivity. The results of the laboratory experiment showed
   that the EC-5 sensor has good output voltage sensitivity below a
   permittivity of 40, but is less sensitive when permittivity is higher.
   The experiments also revealed a distinct dependence of the sensor
   reading on the applied supply voltage. Therefore, a function was
   obtained that allows the permittivity to be determined from the sensor
   reading and the supply voltage. Due to the higher frequency of the EC-5
   sensor, conductivity effects were less pronounced compared to the older
   EC-20 sensor (also Decagon Devices Inc.). However, the EC-5 sensor
   reading was significantly influenced by temperature changes. The field
   experiment showed distinct differences between TDR and EC-5 measurements
   that could be explained to a large degree with the correction functions
   derived from the laboratory measurements. Remaining errors are possibly
   due to soil variability and discrepancies between measurement volume and
   installation depth. Overall, we conclude that the EC-5 sensor is
   suitable for wireless network applications. However, the results of this
   paper also suggest that temperature and electric conductivity effects on
   the sensor reading have to be compensated using appropriate correction
   functions. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Capacitors are used as sensors in several applications. Typically, the
   quantity to be measured changes either the geometric properties of the
   structure used as a capacitive sensor or the physical properties of the
   dielectric between the electrodes of that structure. On the other hand,
   if the sensor geometry maximizes the capacitance due to fringing, then
   the possibilities are totally different. In this case, the electric
   field can be projected onto the test sample. This paper covers the usage
   of fringing field sensors to measure the water present in the soil. We
   examine how the geometry of the PCB-made interdigited electrode
   structure influences the characteristics of the sensor. However,
   fringing field sensors are difficult to be analytically modeled due to
   its intrinsic nonlinear characteristic. Therefore, our conclusions were
   mainly based on results of simulations, but we also tried to reproduce
   the results of the simulations experimentally. Also, we discuss a
   circuit that converts the changes in the sensor's capacitance into
   variations in the width of a pulse signal. Finally, the proposed
   solution has been experimentally compared with the standard gravimetric
   method to quantify the water content in the soil. The results were
   encouraging since the proposed sensor's measurements fit to the
   experimental data with a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.94.},

Abstract = {Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water
   content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase
   in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need
   for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content
   measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to
   make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations
   across a continental-scale network in a production framework that
   incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil
   blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United
   States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for
   a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturer's nominal
   calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types.
   This resulted in negative (91\% of samples) and positive (5\% of
   samples) biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm(3)
   cm(-3) (1 sigma) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived
   soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturer's
   nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to
   +/- 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3) (+/- 1 sigma). A logistic calibration function
   further reduced the mean RMSE to +/- 0.016 cm(3) cm(-3) (+/- 1 sigma)
   and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration
   applied by 18\% compared with the manufacturer's function. However, the
   uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (+/- 0.022 cm(3)
   cm(-3)), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the
   combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content
   values increased to +/- 0.028 cm(3) cm(-3) regardless of the calibration
   function used.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a significant role in both water and energy cycles.
   It is important to manage and analyze in situ sensor observations of
   soil moisture due to its impacts on agricultural and hydrological
   processes. Google Fusion Tables (GFT) is a cloud computing database that
   provides a service on the Web for data management and integration. Using
   GFT for managing soil moisture sensor observations, it is possible to
   take advantages of GFT for collaborative management, on-the-fly
   visualization, and flexible integration and analysis. The Open
   Geospatial Consortium (OGC) sensor observation service (SOS) can provide
   real-time or near-real-time observations in an interoperable way.
   Combing SOS and GFT together can take the best of both. The paper
   investigates how GFT could be employed for managing, visualizing, and
   analyzing soil moisture sensor observations. It describes the design and
   implementation of a cloud-based SOS for managing soil moisture data
   using cloud computing databases. By storing sensor observations in GFT,
   the SOS service is scalable, and observations can be visualized and
   analyzed on demand. Challenges and approaches on the integration of GFT
   and SOS are discussed. A prototype service on sharing and managing soil
   moisture sensor observations is developed to demonstrate the

Abstract = {As we know, soil dielectric property varies along with soil volumetric
   water content variation. In this paper, the high-frequency resonance
   measurements method is used to design the soil moisture sensor. Firstly,
   the high-frequency equivalent electronic model is built by soil and
   sensor circuit. The relationship between the soil volumetric water
   content and resonant frequency is established by means of the
   high-frequency equivalent electronic model analysis. Then, with the
   comparison test on red soil, moisture soil and paddy soil, the
   high-frequency resonance measurements method is proved to be effective
   in soil moisture detection. Finally, the influence of resonant frequency
   and ambient temperature on the relationship is analyzed. The calibration
   method of soil moisture sensor is given. The ideally measuring result of
   soil volumetric water content is obtained. To the best of our knowledge,
   this paper is the first study on soil moisture sensor design based on
   soil dielectric property, which covers circuit theory, hardware
   simulation, resonance frequency selection and temperature compensation.
   The hardware circuit which is used in soil moisture sensor has
   advantages of simple structure, efficient practicability. The experiment
   results show that the soil moisture sensor works well and suits for
   building large-scale agriculture wireless sensor networks.},

Title = {Soil moisture sensor calibration for organic soil surface layers},
Journal = {GEOSCIENTIFIC INSTRUMENTATION METHODS AND DATA SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {5},
Number = {1},
Pages = {109-125},
Abstract = {This paper's objective is to present generic calibration functions for
   organic surface layers derived for the soil moisture sensors Decagon
   ECH2O 5TE and Delta-T ThetaProbe ML2x, using material from northern
   regions, mainly from the Finnish Meteorological Institute's Arctic
   Research Center in Sodankyla and the study area of the Danish Center for
   Hydrology (HOBE). For the Decagon 5TE sensor such a function is
   currently not reported in the literature. Data were compared with
   measurements from underlying mineral soils including laboratory and
   field measurements. Shrinkage and charring during drying were
   considered. For both sensors all field and lab data showed consistent
   trends. For mineral layers with low soil organic matter (SOM) content
   the validity of the manufacturer's calibrations was demonstrated.
   Deviating sensor outputs in organic and mineral horizons were
   identified. For the Decagon 5TE, apparent relative permittivities at a
   given moisture content decreased for increased SOM content, which was
   attributed to an increase of bound water in organic materials with large
   specific surface areas compared to the studied mineral soils. ThetaProbe
   measurements from organic horizons showed stronger nonlinearity in the
   sensor response and signal saturation in the high-level data. The
   derived calibration fit functions between sensor response and volumetric
   water content hold for samples spanning a wide range of humus types with
   differing SOM characteristics. This strengthens confidence in their
   validity under various conditions, rendering them highly suitable for
   large-scale applications in remote sensing and land surface modeling
   studies. Agreement between independent Decagon 5TE and ThetaProbe time
   series from an organic surface layer at the Sodankyla site was
   significantly improved when the here-proposed fit functions were used.
   Decagon 5TE data also well-reflected precipitation events. Thus, Decagon
   5TE network data from organic surface layers at the Sodankyla and HOBE
   sites are based on the here-proposed natural log fit. The newly derived
   ThetaProbe fit functions should be used for hand-held applications only,
   but prove to be of value for the acquisition of instantaneous
   large-scale soil moisture estimates.},

Abstract = {The quantity of water contained in soil is referred to as the soil
   moisture. Soil moisture plays an important role in agriculture,
   percolation, and soil chemistry. Precipitation, temperature, atmospheric
   demand and topography are the primary processes that control soil
   moisture. Estimates of landscape variation in soil moisture are limited
   due to the complexity required to link high spatial variation in
   measurements with the aforesaid processes that vary in space and time.
   In this paper we develop an inferential framework that takes the form of
   data fusion using high temporal resolution environmental data from
   wireless networks along with sparse reflectometer data as inputs and
   yields inference on moisture variation as precipitation and temperature
   vary over time and drainage and canopy coverage vary in space. We
   specifically address soil moisture modeling in the context of wireless
   sensor networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Volume = {252},
Pages = {208-211},
Month = {JUN 27},
Abstract = {To acquire accurate volumetric water content (VWC) measurements from
   horticultural substrates using dielectric sensors, a substrate-specific
   calibration is critical. Calibrations typically are conducted with a
   substrate without plants, but water in the root system may affect soil
   moisture sensor readings. We investigated the effect of root growth on
   the measured VWC. Lettuce seedlings (Lactuca saliva L. `Joek Chi Ma')
   were grown in 10 cm round containers (440 mL) filled with soilless
   substrate. Four EC-5 soil moisture sensors (Decagon Devices Inc.,
   Pullman, WA, USA) were used to determine the effect of root system size
   on sensor calibration over an eight week period. Both calibration
   coefficients (slope and intercept) decreased (P < 0.001) with increasing
   root system size. The actual VWC at 8 weeks after transplanting (WAT)
   was 9\% lower at 65\% VWC compared to the estimated VWC from the
   substrate-only calibration. Multiple regression models indicated that
   various root size indicators (WAT, root fresh weight, root dry weight,
   and root water content) all had a negative effect on the estimation of
   VWC. The effect of root system size on estimated VWC may be tolerable in
   production, but should be considered in research applications. Careful
   interpretation is needed when using FDR soil moisture sensors to monitor
   substrate VWC in the presence of a growing root system.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we have discussed design and development of Time domain
   reflectometery (TDR) system called as IITB\_TDR and also explained the
   novel TDR signal analysis method with wavelet based denoising technique
   in order to determine the soil moisture. Among the reported soil
   measurement techniques, the TDR is known for the accuracy, robustness
   and ease of use for in-situ measurement. Even-though TDR is an
   established technique, high cost and complex design restrict its
   penetration into the agricultural practices. The complexity of the TDR
   system is mainly due to the need of time synchronization between the
   pulse generator which generates the EM wave and sampler which samples
   the pulse with few hundreds of pico seconds resolution. In IITB\_TDR,
   the pulse generator and sampler run independent of each other without
   requiring the time synchronization. The proposed design uses the
   equivalent time sampling with an adaptive delta modulation and the
   sampling resolution of 100 ps has been achieved. To analyze the captured
   TDR signal, a novel time extraction method with wavelet transform based
   denoising is also proposed in this paper. The IITB\_TDR system and
   signal analysis technique have been tested with 5 different standard
   materials and three different types of soil for various levels of
   moisture. The maximum difference of +/- 2\% and +/- 3\% has been
   observed with the IITB\_TDR system when compared with the standard oven
   drying technique and commercial TDR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Year = {2007},
Volume = {94},

Abstract = {Uniform phosphorous fertilisation has economical, ecological and
   agronomical shortcomings. This study was undertaken to optimise the
   variable rate (VR) elemental P application using a previously developed
   on-the-go visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) soil sensor. This
   VIS-NIR sensor consists of a chisel unit, to which the optical unit to
   detect soil extractable phosphorous (P-ext) was attached. A mobile,
   fibre-type VIS-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 45 visnir, Germany)
   with a measurement range between 305 and 1711 nm was used to measure
   soil spectra in reflectance mode. On-the-go measurement of soil spectra
   was carried out in two fields (A and B) situated near Leuven in Belgium.
   From the spectra, P-ext was calculated in soil and subsequently the
   required elemental P was determined. Different averaging windows (AW) of
   the predicted P-ext from successive spectra (2-22) and five
   recommendation classification intervals (RCI) of elemental P of 20, 10,
   5, 2 and 1 kg ha(-1) were assigned and tested. The VR of elemental P was
   compared with uniform rate (UR) application. Results showed that among
   the five RCIs, the minimum elemental P application rate was for interval
   of 5 kg ha(-1), with small differences of among the different RCIs. In
   the fields under study, the amount of elemental P fertiliser according
   to the VR approach was higher than the UR application with an extra
   elemental P of 4 and 2.38 kg ha(-1) for fields A and B, respectively.
   However, this higher elemental P fertiliser recommendation of VR is only
   valid when an equal number of samples (1200 in field A and 660 in field
   13) is considered for both VR and UR methods. Larger amounts of
   elemental P fertiliser were needed for plots and/or fields having higher
   variation in measured P-ext. The results also showed that in both fields
   the application rate decreased with larger AWs. Averaging of less than
   five P-ext successive values was not a proper choice with any RCIs due
   to the large deviation between the target and classified elemental P
   into the different RCIs. The combination of RCI 5 and AW between 10 and
   15 is recommended to provide a good matching between uniform and applied
   elemental P at low cost. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Droughts, typically caused by the deficiencies of precipitation and soil
   moisture, affect water resources and agriculture. As soil moisture is of
   key importance in understanding the interaction between the atmosphere
   and Earth's surface, it can be used to monitor droughts. In this study,
   a High resolution Soil Moisture Drought Index (HSMDI) was proposed and
   evaluated for meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts.
   HSMDI was developed using the 1 km downscaled soil moisture data
   produced from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) from 2003 to 2011 (March to November) over the
   Korean peninsula. Seven products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM)
   satellite sensors were used to downscale AMSR-E soil moisture based on
   random forest machine learning. The downscaled 1 km soil moisture was
   correlated well with both in situ and AMSR-E soil moisture with the mean
   coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.29 and 0.59, respectively. The
   Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with time scales from I to 12
   months, crop yields (for sesame, highland radish, and highland napa
   cabbage) and streamflow data were used to validate HSMDI for various
   types of droughts. The results showed that HSMDI depicted meteorological
   drought well, especially during the dry season, with a similar pattern
   with the 3-month SPI. However, the performance fluctuated a bit during
   the wet season possibly due to the limited availability of optical
   sensor data and heterogeneous land covers around the stations. HSMDI
   also showed high correlation with crop yield data, in particular the
   highland radish and napa cabbage cultivated in non-irrigated regions
   with a mean R-2 of 0.77. However, HSMDI did not monitor streamflow well
   for hydrological drought presenting a various range of correlations with
   streamflow data (from 0.03 to 0.83). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {The current study assesses the potential of two modeling approaches to
   simulate the daily site water budget in Mediterranean ecosystems. Both
   models utilize a simplified one-bucket approach but are fed with
   different drivers. The first model, BIOME-BGC, simulates all main
   biogeochemical fluxes based on conventional meteorological and ancillary
   data, while the second uses evapotranspiration estimates derived from
   the combination of meteorological data and satellite normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. The two models were tested
   for three Italian sites which are characterized by different vegetation
   types and ecoclimatic conditions: (i) low mountain coniferous forest;
   (ii) hilly deciduous forest; (iii) urban grassland. The soil water
   balance simulated by the two models was evaluated through comparison
   with daily measurements of soil water content (SWC) taken during a
   growing season. Satisfactory results were obtained in all cases by both
   approaches; the SWC estimates are significantly correlated with the
   measurements (correlation coefficient, r, higher than 0.74), and the
   mean errors are lower than 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3). The second model,
   however, generally shows a higher accuracy, which is dependent on the
   quality of the NDVI data utilized (r higher than 0.79 and errors lower
   than 0.059 cm(3) cm(-3)). The study therefore provides useful
   indications for the application of these and similar simulation methods
   in different environmental situations.},

   were monitored with TDR to examine the feasibility of this technology
   for recording changes ill trunk water storage. The average stem water
   contents of the oaks reflect the soil water contents, and the temporal
   differences observed (17\%) point to the importance of trunk water for
   coping with soil water deficit. Although it would be very useful to
   obtain a single function to estimate the stem water content of trees, it
   remains necessary to obtain the results in more species.},

Abstract = {The development of site-specific crop management is constrained by the
   availability of sensors for monitoring important soil and crop related
   conditions. A mobile time-domain reflectometry (TDR) unit for
   geo-referenced soil measurements has been developed and used for
   detailed mapping of soil water content and electrical conductivity
   within two research fields. Measurements made during the early or late
   season, when soil moisture levels are close to field capacity, are
   related to the amount of plant available water and soil texture.
   Combined measurements of water content and electrical conductivity are
   closely related to the clay and silt fractions of a variable field. The
   application to early season field mapping of water content, electrical
   conductivity and clay content is presented. The water and clay content
   maps are to be used for automated delineation of field management units.
   Based on a spatial analysis of the soil water measurements,
   recommendations are made with respect to sampling strategies. Depending
   on the variability of a given area, between 15 and 30 ha can be mapped
   with respect to soil moisture and electrical conductivity with
   sufficient detail within 8 h.},

Abstract = {This letter presents an experimental analysis of the application of the

   traditional neural-network-based techniques usually adopted in soil
   moisture content estimation. Its effectiveness in this application is
   assessed by using field measurements and considering various
   combinations of the input features (i.e., different active and/or
   passive microwave measurements acquired using various sensor
   frequencies, polarizations, and acquisition geometries). The performance
   of the SVR method (in terms of estimation accuracy, generalization
   capability, computational complexity, and ease of use) is compared with
   that achieved using a multilayer perceptron neural network, which is

Volume = {552},
Pages = {620-632},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Recent launch of space-borne systems to estimate surface soil moisture
   may expand the capability to map soil moisture deficit and drought with
   global coverage. In this study, we use Soil Moisture Active Passive
   (SMAP) soil moisture geophysical retrieval products from passive L-band
   radiometer to evaluate its applicability to forming agricultural drought
   indices. Agricultural drought is quantified using the Soil Water Deficit
   Index (SWDI) based on SMAP and soil properties (field capacity and
   available water content) information. The soil properties are computed
   using pedo-transfer function with soil characteristics derived from
   Harmonized World Soil Database. The SMAP soil moisture product needs to
   be rescaled to be compatible with the soil parameters derived from the
   in situ stations. In most locations, the rescaled SMAP information
   captured the dynamics of in situ soil moisture well and shows the
   expected lag between accumulations of precipitation and delayed
   increased in surface soil moisture. However, the SMAP soil moisture
   itself does not reveal the drought information. Therefore, the SMAP
   based SWDI (SMAP\_SWDI) was computed to improve agriculture drought
   monitoring by using the latest soil moisture retrieval satellite
   technology. The formulation of SWDI does not depend on longer data and
   it will overcome the limited (short) length of SMAP data for
   agricultural drought studies. The SMAP\_SWDI is further compared with in
   situ Atmospheric Water Deficit (AWD) Index. The comparison shows close
   agreement between SMAP\_SWDI and AWD in drought monitoring over
   Contiguous United States (CONUS), especially in terms of drought
   characteristics. The SMAP\_SWDI was used to construct drought maps for
   CONUS and compared with well-known drought indices, such as, AWD, Palmer
   Z-Index, sc-PDSI and SPEI. Overall the SMAP\_SWDI is an effective
   agricultural drought indicator and it provides continuity and introduces
   new spatial mapping capability for drought monitoring. As an
   agricultural drought index, SMAP\_SWDI has potential to capture short
   term moisture information similar to AWD and related drought indices.

Abstract = {This paper proposes an upscaling technique using a long term measurement
   of soil moisture at a hillslope scale. A monitoring scheme for soil
   moisture was designed and operated over a year. The analysis period was
   divided into four periods in keeping with the seasonal variation of soil
   moisture and considering the characteristics of terrain features. Based
   on rigorous regression analysis, significant relationships were
   established between the seasonal mean soil moisture values at point
   scale and topographic attributes. The cumulative distribution
   function(CDF) matching technique was employed to upscale the soil
   moisture from the fine resolution obtained from local measurements to
   coarser resolution at the watershed scale. The spatial distribution of
   soil depth can be predicted through the application of the multi
   resolution valley bottom flatness algorithm. The scaling issues of
   different resolutions in the terrain analysis could be partially
   resolved during the CDF matching procedure. However, the uncertainty
   associated with the complex terrain of the watershed remained in the
   parameters for the valley bottom evaluation. The spatial distribution of
   soil water could be predicted in the watershed scale by combing the CDF
   matching technique with a soil depth prediction scheme.},

Abstract = {Accurate methods are needed to measure changing soil water content from

   At volumetric moisture content of 0.05 m(3)/m(3) the standard deviation

Abstract = {Accurately estimating soil moisture in arid regions is extremely
   important for agricultural development and soil and water conservation
   in drought prone areas. To reduce the error caused by surface

   temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), this study employed daily
   evapotranspiration (ET) as a parameter to replace land surface
   temperature (LST) and implemented a new spatial index to establish a

   and Fufeng in Shaanxi Province, China are used as the study areas to
   verify the novel SM monitoring approach by using daily ET and the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The correlation between
   LST and ET was higher than 0.8, and the results demonstrated the

   addition, the ET vegetation dryness index (EVDI) feature space can be
   used to retrieve the SM content through a decision support system for
   agrotechnology transfer cropping system model. A linear correlation of
   SM measured at different depths revealed that the EVDI is superior to
   the TVDI for obtaining soil water content and that soil moisture content
   measured at 0-10 cm has a high correlation with both the EVDI and TVDI

Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {46},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Through its role in the energy and water balances at the land surface,
   soil moisture is a key state variable in surface hydrology and
   land-atmosphere interactions. Point observations of soil moisture are
   easy to make using established methods such as time domain reflectometry
   and gravimetric sampling. However, monitoring large-scale variability
   with these techniques is logistically and economically infeasible. Here
   passive soil distributed temperature sensing (DTS) will be introduced as
   an experimental method of measuring soil moisture on the basis of DTS.
   Several fiber-optic cables in a vertical profile are used as thermal
   sensors, measuring propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal
   cycle. Current technology allows these cables to be in excess of 10 km
   in length, and DTS equipment allows measurement of temperatures every 1
   m. The passive soil DTS concept is based on the fact that soil moisture
   influences soil thermal properties. Therefore, observing temperature
   dynamics can yield information on changes in soil moisture content.
   Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that passive soil DTS
   can detect changes in thermal properties. Deriving soil moisture is
   complicated by the uncertainty and nonuniqueness in the relationship
   between thermal conductivity and soil moisture. A numerical simulation
   indicates that the accuracy could be improved if the depth of the cables
   was known with greater certainty.},

Title = {Soil moisture from remote sensing to forecast desert locust presence},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {56},
Number = {4},
Pages = {966-975},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Preventive control of desert locusts is based on monitoring recession
   areas to detect outbreaks. Remote sensing has been increasingly used in
   the preventive control strategy. Soil moisture is a major ecological
   driver of desert locust populations but is still missing in the current
   imagery toolkit for preventive management.
   By means of statistical analyses, combining field observations of locust
   presence/absence and soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution from a
   disaggregation algorithm, we assess the potential of soil moisture to
   help preventive management of desert locust.
   We observe that a soil moisture dynamics increase of above
   0.09cm(3)/cm(3) for 20days followed by a decrease of soil moisture may
   increase the chance to observe locusts 70days later. We estimate the
   gains in early warning timing compared to using imagery from vegetation
   to be 3weeks.
   We demonstrate that forecasting errors may be reduced by the combination
   of several types of indicators such as soil moisture and vegetation
   index in a common statistical model forecasting locust presence.
   Policy implications. Soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution should be
   used to plan desert locust surveys in preventive management. When soil
   moisture increases in a dry area of potential habitat for the desert
   locust, field surveys should be conducted two months later to evaluate
   the need of further preventive actions. Remote sensing estimates of soil
   moisture could also be used for other applications of integrated pest
   management.

   La lutte preventive contre le criquet pelerin consiste a detecter le

   plus en plus utilisee dans la strategie de lutte preventive. Bien que
   l'humidite du sol soit une variable ecologique majeure dans la dynamique
   des populations de criquet pelerin, elle manque a l'arsenal d'outils de
   teledetection pour cette strategie preventive.
   A travers des analyses statistiques qui relient les observations de

   resolution d'un kilometre issues d'un algorithme de desagregation, nous
   evaluons le potentiel de cet indicateur dans la gestion preventive du

   Nous observons qu'une augmentation de l'humidite du sol au-dessus de
   0.09cm(3)/cm(3) pendant 20 jours suivie d'une diminution augmente les
   chances d'observer des criquets pelerins 70 jours plus tard. Nous
   estimons que cet indicateur permet de gagner trois semaines dans
   l'alerte precoce par rapport a l'utilisation d'indicateurs de

   Nous demontrons que les erreurs de prevision de presence des criquets

   Soil Moisture With a Focus on Drought Monitoring},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key drought indicator; however, current in situ soil
   moisture infrastructure is inadequate for large-scale drought
   monitoring. One initiative of the ongoing National Soil Moisture Network
   program is the development of a near real-time drought monitoring
   product that integrates in situ, model, and satellite remote sensing
   data. Data integration from diverse sources requires large-scale
   validation prior to integration. This study develops a framework for
   assessing the fidelity of in situ, model, and satellite soil moisture
   data sets. Here we evaluate data from over 100 in situ monitoring
   stations that are part of nine monitoring networks; North American Land
   Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Climate Prediction Center land
   surface models; and Soil Moisture Active-Passive, Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity, and European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative
   (ESA-CCI) satellite products. The results indicate the majority of in
   situ stations exhibit low error variance and are spatially
   representative; however, some networks and individual stations exhibit
   anomalously high error variance or are sited in a way that make them not
   spatially representative of a larger area. Overall, North American Land
   Data Assimilation System Phase 2 is the modeled product that
   consistently performed best, and Soil Moisture Active-Passive L3 is the
   remotely sensed product that consistently performed the best. They were
   able to both capture in situ soil moisture variability and provide an
   accurate depiction of drought conditions. The methods and verification
   framework applied in this study can be used to evaluate any soil
   moisture data set in any region of the world.
   Plain Language Summary Soil moisture is an important indicator of
   drought; however, there are very few monitoring stations that directly
   measure soil moisture across the contiguous United States. High-quality
   model and/or satellite remote sensing soil moisture estimates can help
   fill in the gaps of in-ground soil moisture measurements. However,
   integration of soil moisture data from diverse sources requires
   assessment of data quality. This study applies a series of methods for
   evaluating the integrity of in-ground, model, and satellite soil
   moisture data sets across the United States. The results indicate that
   the majority of in-ground sensors tested exhibit high data quality,
   although some exhibit high measurement error and/or low spatial
   representativeness. The results also indicate that the land surface
   models that are part of the North American Land Data Assimilation System
   Phase 2 and the Soil Moisture Active-Passive remotely sensed soil
   moisture products best match in-ground soil moisture measurement
   variability. Additionally, North American Land Data Assimilation System
   Phase 2 and Soil Moisture Active-Passive data sets accurately depict
   drought occurrence. The methods applied here can be used to evaluate the
   quality of soil moisture data sets in any region of the world.},

Title = {An Extended Kriging Method to Interpolate Near-Surface Soil Moisture
   Data Measured by Wireless Sensor Networks},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the practice of interpolating near-surface soil moisture measured by
   a wireless sensor network (WSN) grid, traditional Kriging methods with
   auxiliary variables, such as Co-kriging and Kriging with external drift
   (KED), cannot achieve satisfactory results because of the heterogeneity
   of soil moisture and its low correlation with the auxiliary variables.
   This study developed an Extended Kriging method to interpolate with the
   aid of remote sensing images. The underlying idea is to extend the
   traditional Kriging by introducing spectral variables, and operating on
   spatial and spectral combined space. The algorithm has been applied to
   WSN-measured soil moisture data in HiWATER campaign to generate daily
   maps from 10 June to 15 July 2012. For comparison, three traditional
   Kriging methods are applied: Ordinary Kriging (OK), which used WSN data
   only, Co-kriging and KED, both of which integrated remote sensing data
   as covariate. Visual inspections indicate that the result from Extended
   Kriging shows more spatial details than that of OK, Co-kriging, and KED.

Abstract = {The SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) mission directly responds to
   the current lack of global observations of soil moisture and ocean
   salinity, which are needed to improve meteorological and climatic
   predictions. The mission will produce measurements of brightness
   temperature by using an innovative Microwave Image Radiometer using
   Aperture Synthesis at L-Band (MIRAS). The objective of this paper is to
   assess the possibility to have an operative long term monitoring of the
   instrument calibration in the SMOS ground segment, by observing large
   areas of the Earth surface characterized by a stable emmissivity at
   L-band, with slight variations, when compared with the radiometric
   accuracy of MIRAS. To this aim, C band signatures collected by the
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System
   (AMSR-E) over the Brazilian rain forest and ERS-2 Scatterometer data
   over Antarctica have been analyzed, in order to select areas with the
   best spatial and temporal stability. Extrapolations to L-band have been
   obtained by using model simulations for the Amazon case and experimental
   data available in the literature for Antarctica. An operational
   procedure to monitor the selected areas has been defined to be
   implemented in the SMOS ground segment.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a variable of paramount importance for a number of
   natural processes and requires the capacity to be routinely measured at
   different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., hillslope and/or small
   catchment scale). The electromagnetic induction (EMI) method is one of
   the geophysical techniques potentially useful in this regard. Indeed, it
   does not require contact with the ground, it allows a relatively fast
   survey of hillslope, it gives information related to soil depth greater
   than few centimetres and it can also be used in wooded areas. In this
   study, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil moisture (SM)
   measurements were jointly carried out by using a multi-frequency EMI
   sensor (GEM-300) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes,
   respectively. The aim was to retrieve SM variations at the hillslope
   scale over four sites, characterized by different land-soil units,
   located in a small mountainous catchment in southern Italy. Repeated
   measurements of ECa carried out over a fixed point showed that the
   signal variability of the GEM-300 sensor (Std. Err. similar
   to{[}0.02-0.1 ms/m]) was negligible. The correlation estimated between
   point ECa and SM, measured with both portable and buried TDR probes,
   varied between 0.24 and 0.58, depending on the site considered. In order
   to reduce the effect of small-scale variability, a spatial smoothing
   filter was applied which allowed the estimation of linear relationships
   with higher coefficient of correlation (r similar to 0.46-0.8). The
   accuracy obtained in the estimation of the temporal trend of the soil
   moisture spatial averages was in the range similar to 4.5-7.8\% v/v and
   up to the similar to 70\% of the point soil moisture variance was
   explained by the ECa signal. The obtained results highlighted the
   potential of EMI to provide, in a short time, sufficiently accurate
   estimate of soil moisture over large areas that are highly needed for
   hydrological and remote sensing applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {A procedure to determine soil moisture threshold (theta{*}), cover
   coefficient (k (c)), and parameters of soil moisture stress function (k
   (s)) is proposed in this study. These coefficients can be further
   applied to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration in a hydrological
   model. Two soil moisture stress functions are used to describe k (s).
   One of the functions is proposed by this study, which assumes moisture
   stress is inversely proportional to matric potential described by van
   Genuchten retention curve. The procedure is applied to identify the
   coefficients for three kinds of reference potential evapotranspiration
   based on soil moisture monitoring. Soil moisture was measured by
   Watermark soil moisture sensors. These sensors were tested in a
   laboratory to establish the relationship between soil moisture and
   recorded tensor. Then, these sensors were installed in an experimental
   forest watershed. The verification study shows that the calibrated
   coefficients can provide reasonable estimate of actual
   evapotranspiration. The R (2) = 0.85 for using the Penman-Montieth
   equation for tall maize along with k (c) = 1.81 can be obtained for the
   validation period with soil moisture stress. Besides, the results also
   indicate the proposed soil moisture stress function can have better
   performance on estimating daily actual evapotranspiration at early stage
   of a dry period. The proposed procedure and soil moisture stress
   functions can be successfully applied to estimate daily
   evapotranspiration when soil moisture is known. However, their
   performance in a hydrological model requires further study, since a
   hydrological model can only provide estimated soil moisture.},

Abstract = {In the present investigation, we report a voltammetric sensor based on

   potassium is one of the major nutrient elements required by the plants

   assay is based on recording change in current signal of a positively
   charged redox probe, hexammineruthenium(III)chloride in the absence and
   presence of K+ ion in solution. The sensing interface is highly stable
   and reproducible for detection of K+ ion a under a wide range of
   concentration 1 to 500 ppm. The detection sensitivity over a wide
   concentration range was achieved by altering the concentration of redox
   species. Mechanistically, the recognition properties of
   4-aminobenzo-18-Crown-6 covalently bound to the Nafion on carbon surface
   was found to be selective for potassium ion over sodium, ammonium and
   calcium ion. Potassium recognition through host-guest binding of crown

   the systems highly promising for real-time applications in soil

Abstract = {This paper reports the development of a wireless, integrated,
   frequency-domain soil moisture sensor for paddy field applications. This
   soil sensor is able to measure soil moisture content and water depth at
   the same time and transmit the collected data wirelessly to a target
   receiver. The sensor consists of five parts: Probes, Sensor Acquisition
   Module, Processor Module, Communication Module and Power Supply Module.
   A sensor package was designed as well for convenient installation and
   practical deployment in paddy fields. The sensor was calibrated with
   various soil samples. The performances of the sensor were tested on
   measurement range, stability, system error, energy consumption and
   transmission distance. Results indicated that the optimum range of the
   soil moisture content was from 30\% to 50\%, and the measurement range
   of water depth was from 1 cm to 8 cm. Within these ranges measurement
   errors were less than 5\% for soil moisture content and 0.5 cm for water
   depth. The sensor could transfer reliably 60 m and work continuously for
   at least 4 months using a 2100 mAh/3.6 V battery. It is suitable for
   monitoring soil moisture content and water depth in paddy fields. (C)

Abstract = {This paper presents examples of the application of the TDR (Time-Domain

   correlated with the vehicle mobility index and a simple model for this
   correlation was derived. Using grassy airfield research, soil moisture
   data were related to meteorological impacts (precipitation, sunlight,
   etc.). Generally, it was concluded that the TDR meter, in its handheld

Title = {Applications of Soil Moisture Sensor with Electrokinetic Ion Trap
   Mechanism},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2014},
Abstract = {A sensor comprising a pair of stainless steel planar electrodes and a
   capacitance meter is proposed for the real-time monitoring of the
   moisture content in soil. As rain falls on the ground, the moisture
   content of the soil between the two electrodes increases. The resulting
   change in the dielectric constant of the sensingmaterial (soil) produces
   a corresponding change in the capacitance signal, from which the
   moisture content can then be inversely derived. The measurement
   performance of the proposed sensor is enhanced by means of an ion trap
   mechanism comprising two graphite mesh electrodes positioned
   orthogonally to the measurement electrodes. A DC voltage is applied to
   the two electrodes such that the anions and cations in the water are
   trapped by the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, thereby
   minimizing their effects on the sensing operation. The experimental
   results show that the proposed sensor achieves a high degree of
   sensitivity (i.e., 1.27 mu F/\%) for gravimetric water contents ranging
   from 21 to 28\%. Moreover, it is shown that the sensor has a
   repeatability of +/- 0.71\% and +/- 0.55\% for low and high gravimetric
   water contents, respectively.},

Abstract = {Bias correction is a very important pre-processing step in satellite
   data assimilation analysis, as data assimilation itself cannot
   circumvent satellite biases. We introduce a retrieval algorithm-specific
   and spatially heterogeneous Instantaneous Field of View (IFOV) bias
   correction method for Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) soil
   moisture. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to
   present the probabilistic presentation of SMOS soil moisture using
   retrieval ensembles. We illustrate that retrieval ensembles effectively
   mitigated the overestimation problem of SMOS soil moisture arising from
   brightness temperature errors over West Africa in a computationally
   efficient way (ensemble size: 12, no time-integration). In contrast, the
   existing method of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching
   considerably increased the SMOS biases, due to the limitations of
   relying on the imperfect reference data. From the validation at two
   semi-arid sites, Benin (moderately wet and vegetated area) and Niger
   (dry and sandy bare soils), it was shown that the SMOS errors arising
   from rain and vegetation attenuation were appropriately corrected by
   ensemble approaches. In Benin, the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs)
   decreased from 0.1248 m(3)/m(3) for CDF matching to 0.0678 m(3)/m(3) for
   the proposed ensemble approach. In Niger, the RMSEs decreased from 0.14
   m(3)/m(3) for CDF matching to 0.045 m(3)/m(3) for the ensemble approach.},

Abstract = {New soil moisture sensor systems (SMSs) for irrigation control have been
   commercialized in recent years. However, limited research has been
   carried out to evaluate their precision to measure the volumetric soil
   water content (theta). The objectives of this research were to: (a)
   determine the relationship between theta and the theta sensed by four
   commercially available SMSs, (b) quantify the proportion of scheduled
   irrigation cycles (SICs) that the SMSs bypassed, and (c) determine the
   theta at which SICs were allowed or bypassed. Sensors from brands
   Acclima, Rain Bird, Irrometer, and Water Watcher were buried at 7-10 cm
   depth, on plots with common bermudagrass {[}Cynodon dactylon (L.)
   Pers.]. A calibrated ECH2O probe was also installed in every plot, at
   the same depth, to monitor theta continuously. When comparing the ECH2O
   readings with theta sensed by the SMSs, significant correlations were
   found for the three Acclima RS500 (AC) systems tested, and for two of
   the three systems of Irrometer Watermark 200SS/WEM (IM) and Rain Bird
   MS-100 (RB). Most of the SMS-based treatments bypassed the majority of
   the SICs during rainy periods, and allowed irrigation during the dry
   periods. On average, 71\% of the SICs were bypassed by the SMS
   treatments, without detriment to the turfgrass quality. However, most of
   the SMSs were not found to be precision instruments, because sometimes
   they bypassed SICs and sometimes they did not, even when reading the
   same or a lower theta. Considering the average theta range of over which
   the different SMS treatments always allowed or always bypassed
   irrigation, brand AC resulted in the significantly narrowest range
   (1.4\%) followed by RB (3.2\%), suggesting that they were more
   consistent and precise in measuring theta than Water Watcher DPS-100
   (WW) and IM (7.4 and 7.8\%, respectively). These results are consistent
   with the reported water savings achieved by these SMSs in related
   studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC)
   and biomass production is important for sustainable resources
   management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous
   noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray
   neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron
   ratio (N-r) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity
   contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy
   interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the
   accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during
   agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we
   instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes
   and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground
   biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear
   relationship between N-r and the aboveground biomass that allowed to
   continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout
   the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22
   kg/m(2). This information was used together with measured belowground
   biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with
   CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates
   considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error
   from 0.046 to 0.013 cm(3)/cm(3). We anticipate that future research on
   the N-r can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates
   and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception,
   ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary
   and roving CRNS systems.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates novel supervised machine learning (SML)
   techniques for bulk soil moisture estimation using cosmic ray sensor.
   The cosmic ray soil moisture measuring probes are deployed across
   Australia as a part of CosmOz sensor network. These probes are brand new
   sensing technology still evaluated. The primary purpose of this paper is
   to find an alternative well-established SML-based method to estimate
   bulk soil moisture directly from the cosmic ray sensors that would
   effectively replace the current calibration equations. The second aspect
   of this paper is to find an alternative method to replace the cosmic ray
   sensor's current expensive and time-consuming field soil sample
   collection protocol. Data collected over 350 consecutive days from
   Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) database and Hydroinnova
   CRS-1000 cosmic ray soil moisture probe deployed in Tullochgorum,
   Tasmania are used in this paper. Prediction performances of the four
   supervised estimators, such as sugano type adaptive neuro-fuzzy
   inference system (S-ANFIS), multilayer perceptron network, probabilistic
   neural network, and radial basis function network are evaluated using
   training and testing paradigms. The best result indicates that S-ANFIS
   is able to match the results achieved using existing calibration
   equations with a 87\% accuracy. Secondly, AWAP data trained S-ANFIS is
   able to predict bulk soil moisture directly from cosmic ray neutron
   counts with a 92\% accuracy without using any collected field
   sample-based measurements. Finally, a novel method is also developed to
   produce an estimated area average bulk soil moisture grid surface map
   based on multiple ANFIS and cubic grid surface interpolation.},

   surface measurement using wavelet transform},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {563},
Pages = {834-850},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Temporal variation of water in the vadose zone is important to
   understand processes such as solute transport and nutrient cycling.
   Measurements of soil water content (SWC) in the subsurface are less
   common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical
   models are limited by data availability. Wavelet decomposition of
   surface measurements of SWC could improve modeling of subsurface SWC by
   segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to
   the subsurface. The objectives of this work were to: 1) predict
   subsurface SWC using surface SWC and a combination of wavelet analysis
   and linear regression, and 2) investigate relationships between soil
   properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales, s.
   Climate data and SWC at various depths were collected from eight sites
   in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil water retention and
   hydraulic conductivity (k) functions of each horizon were optimized by
   comparing measured and predicted (using HYDRUS-1D) soil water contents.
   Each time series of SWC was decomposed into 50 scale components using
   the Mexican Hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with
   minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal. Changes in the
   values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer
   coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from
   particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions.
   Prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors
   for s < 256 h, while k at -10 kPa was the best predictor for 256 h < s <
   724 h, and the median value of particle size diameters for s > 724 h.
   Subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the
   proposed approach, particularly when vertical movement of soil water is
   unrestricted.},

Abstract = {We have established a soil moisture profile monitoring network in the
   Raam region in the Netherlands. This region faces water shortages during
   summers and excess of water during winters and after extreme
   precipitation events. Water management can benefit from reliable
   information on the soil water availability and water storing capacity in
   the unsaturated zone. In situ measurements provide a direct source of
   information on which water managers can base their decisions. Moreover,
   these measurements are commonly used as a reference for the calibration
   and validation of soil moisture content products derived from earth
   observations or obtained by model simulations. Distributed over the Raam
   region, we have equipped 14 agricultural fields and 1 natural grass
   field with soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring
   instrumentation, consisting of Decagon 5TM sensors installed at depths
   of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 cm. In total, 12 stations are located within the
   Raam catchment (catchment area of 223 km(2)), and 5 of these stations
   are located within the closed sub-catchment Hooge Raam (catchment area
   of 41 km(2)). Soil-specific calibration functions that have been
   developed for the 5TM sensors under laboratory conditions lead to an
   accuracy of 0.02m(3)m(-3). The first set of measurements has been
   retrieved for the period 5 April 2016-4 April 2017. In this paper, we
   describe the Raam monitoring network and instrumentation, the
   soil-specific calibration of the sensors, the first year of
   measurements, and additional measurements (soil temperature, phreatic
   groundwater levels and meteorological data) and information (elevation,
   soil physical characteristics, land cover and a geohydrological model)

Abstract = {Several parameterization schemes have been developed to retrieve the
   soil moisture information involved in the remotely sensed surface
   temperature-vegetation index (T-s - VI) space. However, most of them are
   performed with the constraint of the dry edge of the T-s - VI space to
   define the maximum water stressed conditions. In view of the
   subjectivity and uncertainty involved in the determination of the dry
   edge, a new index termed as the Modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness
   Index (MTVDI) was developed in this paper to reduce the reliance of the
   parameterization scheme on the dry edge. In the parameterization scheme
   of MTVDI, isopleth lines of soil moisture involved in the feature space
   were retrieved by the temperature-vegetation index method, and only the
   maximum surface temperature of bare soil (T-smax) was indispensable in
   the definition of maximum water stressed conditions. For evaluation
   purpose, the MTVDI was demonstrated in the Southern Great Plains region
   of the U.S. and was compared with two other traditional soil moisture
   indexes developed under the constraint of dry edge. The comparison
   confirmed the effectivity of the MTVDI in monitoring the spatial pattern
   and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Our analyses also suggest that
   T-smax, the only parameter needed in the definition of maximum water
   stressed conditions, can be retrieved directly from the parameterization
   scheme itself. Therefore, the retrieval of MTVDI can be performed
   independent of the dry edge, which is a significant improvement to the
   traditional parameterization schemes of soil moisture from the T-s - VI
   feature space.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an essential climate variable influencing
   land-atmosphere interactions, an essential hydrologic variable impacting
   rainfall-runoff processes, an essential ecological variable regulating
   net ecosystem exchange, and an essential agricultural variable
   constraining food security. Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has
   advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific
   understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are
   being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this
   complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications,
   the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly
   developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in
   large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs
   for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture
   data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and
   proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing
   missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications
   of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term
   progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for
   drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for
   meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but
   significant challenges related to spatial variability and model
   structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of
   large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological
   or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science
   and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of
   improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.},

Abstract = {The recently launched Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite
   is providing soil moisture observations at continental scales by
   measuring L-band microwave radiation emitted from the land surface.
   While its retrieval algorithms will correct for factors such as
   vegetation and surface roughness, it will not correct for soil salinity.
   This letter tests the assumption that soil salinity will have a
   negligible impact on L-band brightness temperature (T-b) at SMOS scales
   using field data; airborne T-b observations were collected in a saline
   groundwater discharge area near Nilpinna Station, South Australia. At
   the 500-m scale, the airborne observations of T-b could not be
   reproduced using the baseline algorithm of the SMOS Level 2 retrieval
   scheme, without accounting for soil salinity in the model. The analysis
   in this letter shows that soil moisture retrieval errors of at least
   0.04 m(3)m(-3) (i.e., the entire SMOS error budget) will occur due to
   salinity alone in SMOS footprints with saline coverage as low as 25\%
   (possibly even much less). Consequently, fractional salinity coverage
   cannot be considered a negligible factor by microwave soil moisture
   satellite missions.},

Abstract = {Ring-capacitor sensors are used widely for real-time estimation of
   volumetric soil water content theta from measured resonant frequency
   f(r), which is directly affected by the bulk soil permittivity e.
   However, the relationship fr( e) requires improved quantification. We
   conducted laboratory experiments to characterize the response of the
   Sentek EnviroSMART sensor system for a full range of e values from air
   to water and a range of temperatures. Water-dioxane mixtures were placed
   into a solvent-resistant container equipped with custom tools for
   heating and mixing the fluid, removing air bubbles from sensitive
   surfaces, measuring permittivity in situ, and creating an axisymmetric
   metal disturbance to the electric field. Total capacitance C was
   measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected to one sensor,
   while four other sensors provided replicated fr readings. The measured
   temperature response of free water permittivity was linear with a
   negative slope, which is qualitatively consistent with theory. A precise
   nonlinear relationship between e and normalized fr was derived. The
   instrumental error in e was RMSE epsilon = 0.226 ( for < epsilon < 43),
   which corresponds to a measurement precision in theta(epsilon) derived
   from Topp's equation of RMSE theta= 0.0034 m(3) m(-3). Axisymmetric
   numerical simulations of the electric field supplemented the
   experimental results. The characteristic length scale for the distance
   measured radially from the access tube is 12.5 mm, meaning that 80 and
   95\% of the signal are sensed within approximately 20 and 37 mm of the
   access tube, respectively. The results are crucial for scientific
   applications of the investigated sensor type to environmental media.},

   output is related to dielectric permittivity using an empirical
   calibration in liquids with well-defined permittivities. Using these
   calibration measurements, we have evaluated sensor-to-sensor variability
   and compared the accuracy of a universal calibration between sensor
   output and permittivity with a sensor-specific calibration. Our results
   showed that the sensor-to-sensor variability of the SPADE sensor is
   larger than sensor noise and that a sensor-specific calibration can
   improve the accuracy of soil water content estimation as compared to a
   single universal calibration. To quantify the effect of temperature on
   the sensor output, we have derived a temperature correction function in
   a temperature range from 5 to 40 degrees C. The results showed an
   underestimation for low temperatures (5 to 25 degrees C) and an
   overestimation for high temperatures (25 to 40 degrees C). A
   second-order polynomial function was fitted to the measurements with
   good agreement (R-2 = 0.9831, RMSE = 0.1489). The transferability of the
   temperature correction function from reference liquids to soils was
   verified using saturated coarse sand and a silty loam soil sample. The
   temperature-corrected SPADE sensor measurements in soil showed good
   agreement with TDR measurements and corresponded well with theoretical
   predictions from a dielectric mixing model.},

Abstract = {Spatial distribution of soil moisture (SM) is a prerequisite for
   research and management of agriculture and ecology. However, it is still
   a challenge to retrieve SM data in highly heterogeneous landscapes. By
   investigating environmental factors (soil, vegetation and topography)
   and comparing different remote sensing sources (Landsat-8, Radarsat-2,
   ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) V002 (ASTGTM2), unmanned
   aerial vehicle (UAV)) for karst mountainous catchments of southwest
   China, this study identified key controlling factors on the spatial
   distribution of SM and built a remote sensing model for SM estimation in
   highly heterogeneous landscapes. Results showed that vegetation type
   (35.7\%), aspect (7.7\%), height index (4.2\%), soil bulk density
   (3.3\%), soil total nitrogen (3.1\%), aspect interact with vegetation
   type (3.4\%) and soil total phosphorous (1.3\%) totally explained 58.8\%
   of the SM variability. The correlations between SM and topographic
   derivatives varied with DEM resolutions (1-50 m), and generally reached
   their highest values at 7 m for height index, slope gradient, and
   aspect, 16 m for flow accumulation and topographic wetness index, and 43
   m for curvature. Partial least-squares regression analysis showed that
   optical and infrared bands from Landsat-8 and topographic derivatives
   from UAV photogrammetry DEM were more strongly con-elated with SM than
   other datasets. An empirical model (SM = 9.27 {*} 10(-2)HI - 1.82 {*}
   10(-5) B5 + 0.519) with only height index and B5 band from Landsat-8 as
   inputs is proposed, as it shows acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.36; RMSE
   = 0.076). The results of this study provide useful information for SM
   remote sensing in karst mountainous area and similar heterogeneous
   landscapes.},

Journal = {CANADIAN GEOTECHNICAL JOURNAL},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {51},
Number = {3},
Pages = {332-345},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Measurement of the moisture variation in soils is required for
   geotechnical design and research because soil properties and behavior
   can vary as moisture content changes. The neutron probe, which was
   developed more than 40 years ago, is commonly used to monitor soil
   moisture variation in the field. This study reports a full-scale field
   monitoring of soil moisture using a neutron moisture probe for a period
   of more than 2 years in the Melbourne (Australia) region. On the basis
   of soil types available in the Melbourne region, 23 sites were chosen
   for moisture monitoring down to a depth of 1500 mm. The field
   calibration method was used to develop correlations relating the
   volumetric moisture content and neutron counts. Observed results showed
   that the deepest ``wetting front{''} during the wet season was limited
   to the top 800 to 1000 mm of soil whilst the top soil layer down to
   about 550 mm responded almost immediately to the rainfall events. At
   greater depths (550 to 800 mm and below 800 mm), the moisture variations
   were relatively low and displayed predominantly periodic fluctuations.
   This periodic nature was captured with Fourier analysis to develop a
   cyclic moisture model on the basis of an analytical solution of a
   one-dimensional moisture flow equation for homogeneous soils. It is
   argued that the model developed can be used to predict the soil moisture
   variations as applicable to buried structures such as pipes.},

Title = {Investigation of the influence of soil moisture on thermal response
   tests using active distributed temperature sensing (A-DTS) technology},
Journal = {ENERGY AND BUILDINGS},

Abstract = {In-situ thermal response testing (TRT) has become the most effective way
   to determine ground thermal parameters before developing renewable
   geothermal energy systems. However, these parameters may not be static
   when some hydrologic conditions in porous formation change with time. In
   this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the ground heat exchange
   performance using the active distributed temperature sensing (A-DTS)
   technology, which infers soil moisture by a thermal response caused by
   active electrical current. We evaluated the feasibility of this method
   by several lab experiments and a field thermal response test (TRT).
   Using this method, the relationship between thermal conductivity and
   soil moisture content was established for silt, clay, organic soil and
   sand, respectively. To quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of soil
   thermal conductivity to moisture content, a new parameter called
   relative thermal conductivity (beta), is defined to describe the effect
   of water bridges among soil solid particles on thermal conductivity. The
   lab test results demonstrate that soil moisture content has significant
   influence on thermal conductivity when the soil is nearly dry (beta >
   beta((cri ))), but its effect becomes less evident when the soil is
   moist(beta <= beta((cri))). It is found that the relationship between
   soil moisture content and thermal conductivity can be well fitted by the
   Johansen model. The results of the field-scale TRT demonstrated the
   ability of the proposed technique to detect the effects of rainfall on
   soil thermal conductivity near the ground surface. The field test
   results also suggest that the soil thermal conductivity measured by
   in-situ DTS is larger than that obtained from soil samples in lab.
   However, for rock, the thermal conductivity acquired by DTS is less than
   the values collected in lab. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {114},
Number = {2},
Pages = {440-448},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {A new method for retrieving soil moisture content over vegetated fields,
   employing multitemporal radar and optical images, is presented. It is
   based on the integration of the temporal series of radar data within an
   inversion scheme and on the correction of the vegetation effects. The
   retrieval algorithm uses the Bayesian maximum posterior probability and
   assumes the existence of a relation among the soil conditions at the
   different times of the series. The correction of the vegetation effects
   models the variation, with respect to the initial time of the series, of
   the component of the backscattering coefficient due to the soil
   characteristics as function of the variations of the measured
   backscattering coefficient and of the biomass. The method is tested on
   the data acquired throughout the SMEX02 experiment. The results show
   that measured and estimated soil moistures are fairly well correlated
   and that the performances of multitemporal retrieval algorithm are
   better than those obtained by employing one radar acquisition,
   especially in terms of capability to detect soil moisture changes.
   Although the approach to correct the vegetation effects on radar
   observations needs to be further assessed on different sets of data,
   this finding demonstrates that the proposed method has a potential to
   improve the quality of the soil moisture retrievals. (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an integral quantity in hydrology that represents the
   average conditions in a finite volume of soil. In this paper, a novel
   regression technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented
   and applied to soil moisture estimation using remote sensing data. SVM
   is based on statistical learning theory that uses a hypothesis space of
   linear functions based on Kernel approach. SVM has been used to predict
   a quantity forward in time based on training from past data. The
   strength of SVM lies in minimizing the empirical classification error
   and maximizing the geometric margin by solving inverse problem. SVM
   model is applied to 10 sites for soil moisture estimation in the Lower
   Colorado River Basin (LCRB) in the western United States. The sites
   comprise low to dense vegetation. Remote sensing data that includes
   backscatter and incidence angle from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
   (TRMM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Advanced
   Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used to estimate soil water
   content (SM). Simulated SM (\%) time series for the study sites are
   available from the Variable Infiltration Capacity Three Layer (VIC)
   model for top 10 cm layer of soil for the years 1998-2005. SVM model is
   trained on 5 years of data, i.e. 1998-2002 and tested on 3 years of
   data, i.e. 2003-2005. Two models are developed to evaluate the strength
   of SVM modeling in estimating soil moisture. In model I, training and
   testing are done on six sites, this results in six separate SVM models -
   one for each site. Model II comprises of two subparts: (a) data from all
   six sites used in model I is combined and a single SVM model is
   developed and tested on same sites and (b) a single model is developed
   using data from six sites (same as model II-A) but this model is tested
   on four separate sites not used to train the model. Model I shows
   satisfactory results, and the SM estimates are in good agreement with
   the estimates from VIC model. The SM estimate correlation coefficients
   range from 0.34 to 0.77 with RMSE less than 2\% at all the selected
   sites. A probabilistic absolute error between the VIC SM and modeled SM
   is computed for all models. For model I, the results indicate that 80\%
   of the SM estimates have an absolute error of less than 5\%, whereas for
   model II-A and II-B, 80\% and 60\% of the SM estimates have an error
   less than 10\% and 15\%, respectively. SVM model is also trained and
   tested for measured soil moisture in the LCRB. Results with RMSE, MAE
   and R of 2.01, 1.97, and 0.57, respectively show that the SVM model is
   able to capture the variability in measured soil moisture. Results from
   the SVM modeling are compared with the estimates obtained from feed
   forward-back propagation Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) and
   Multivariate Linear Regression model (MLR); and show that SVM model
   performs better for soil moisture estimation than ANN and MLR models.

Year = {2018},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {The main objective of this research is to develop, test and validate
   soil moisture retrieval method based on multi-source SAR (Synthetic
   Aperture Radar) data for bare agricultural areas. The Radardat-2,
   TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A SAR data were applied to retrieve soil
   moisture content in combination with the integral equation model (IEM)
   or calibrated integral equation model (CIEM). A straightforward
   inversion scheme was developed, which does not require the prior
   knowledge of surface roughness. The soil moisture content can be
   directly estimated using a look-up table (LUT) optimization method with
   multi-source SAR data as inputs. For validation purpose, in situ soil
   moisture content was measured during the period of SAR data
   acquisitions. The effectiveness and reliability of the soil moisture
   retrieval methods were evaluated based on the in situ measurements and
   cost function distribution graph. The experimental results indicate that
   the developed approach provided accurate soil moisture estimates with
   root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3) to 0.079
   cm(3) cm(-3) over the experimental areas. The distribution graphs of the
   cost function demonstrate the uniqueness and convergence of the
   estimated results based on multi-source SAR data. Either IEM or CIEM was
   employed to estimate soil moisture content, more accurate results were
   obtained with Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A data as inputs. The
   experimental results preliminary illustrate that the multi-source SAR
   data are promising for soil moisture retrieval over bare agricultural
   areas. The novelty of the presented research can be summarized as two
   aspects. Firstly, the multi-sensor SAR with different incidence angle,
   different frequency and different polarization were combined to estimate
   soil moisture content by means of the physical-based methods. The
   combination of the multi-sensor SAR data can effectively solve the
   ill-posed problem of soil moisture retrieval using physical models.
   Secondly, the CIEM was utilized to establish the soil moisture retrieval
   model, which transforms the three unknown parameters to two unknown
   parameters. Furthermore, the convergence and uniqueness of the estimated
   soil moisture were validated through distribution graphs of the cost
   function.},

Abstract = {The complex interactions between soil moisture and precipitation are
   difficult to observe, and consequently there is a lack of consensus as
   to the sign, strength, and location of these interactions. Inconsistency
   between soil moisture-precipitation interaction studies can be
   attributed to a multitude of factors, including the difficulty of
   demonstrating causal relationships, dataset differences, and
   precipitation autocorrelation. The purpose of this study is to explore
   these potential confounding factors and determine which are most
   important for consideration when assessing statistical coupling between
   soil moisture and precipitation. Soil moisture is assessed via three
   remote sensing datasets: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for
   Earth Observing System, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
   Microwave Imager, and the Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture.
   Estimates of soil moisture are coupled with afternoon thunderstorm
   events identified by the Thunderstorm Observation by Radar (ThOR)
   algorithm, and dry soil or wet soil preferences for convection
   initiation are determined for over 16 000 thunderstorm events between
   2005 and 2007. Differences in soil moisture datasets were found to have
   the largest impact with regard to determining wet or dry soil
   preferences. Precipitation autocorrelation is prevalent in the data;
   however, precipitation autocorrelation did not influence the results
   with regard to dry or wet soil preferences. Consideration of the
   convective environment (i.e., weakly or synoptically forced) did result
   in significant differences in wet/dry soil preference, but only for
   certain soil moisture datasets. The results suggest that
   observation-driven soil moisture-precipitation interaction studies
   should both consider the convective environment and implement multiple
   soil moisture datasets to assure robust results.},

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays significant roles in various
   scientific fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and
   ecology. However, the spatial resolutions of microwave SSM products are
   too coarse for regional applications. Most current optical/thermal
   infrared SSM retrieval models cannot directly estimate the quantitative
   volumetric soil water content without establishing empirical
   relationships between ground-based SSM measurements and
   satellite-derived proxies of SSM. Therefore, in this paper, SSM is
   estimated directly from 5-km-resolution Chinese Geostationary
   Meteorological Satellite FY-2E data based on an elliptical-new SSM
   retrieval model developed from the synergistic use of diurnal cycles of
   land surface temperature (LST) and net surface shortwave radiation
   (NSSR). The elliptical-original model was constructed for bare soil and
   did not consider the impacts of different fractional vegetation cover
   (FVC) conditions. To optimize the elliptical-original model for
   regional-scale SSM estimates, it is improved in this paper by
   considering the influence of FVC, which is based on a dimidiate pixel
   model and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized
   difference vegetation index product. A preliminary validation of the
   model is conducted based on ground measurements from the counties of
   Maqu, Luqu, and Ruoergai in the source area of the Yellow River. A
   correlation coefficient (R) of 0.620, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of
   0.146 m(3)/m(3), and a bias of 0.038 m(3)/m(3) were obtained when
   comparing the in situ measurements with the FY-2E-derived SSM using the
   elliptical-original model. In contrast, the FY-2E-derived SSM using the
   elliptical-new model exhibited greater consistency with the ground
   measurements, as evidenced by an R of 0.845, an RMSE of 0.064 m(3)/m(3),
   and a bias of 0.017 m(3)/m(3). To provide accurate SSM estimates,
   high-accuracy FVC, LST, and NSSR data are required. To complement the
   point-scale validation conducted here, cross-comparisons with other
   existing SSM products will be conducted in the future studies.},

   variation of the surface water. However, remote sensors do not measure
   soil water content directly. Therefore, it is of great importance to
   establish a SM retrieval model. In this paper, the relationship between
   SM and diffuse reflectance was first derived using the absorption
   coefficient and scattering coefficient related to SM. Then, based on
   Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory, the SM retrieval model using reflectance
   information was further derived, which is a semi-empirical model with an
   unknown parameter obtained either from fitting or from experimental
   measurements. The validity and reliability of the model were confirmed
   with the validation set. The results showed that the root mean square
   errors of prediction (RMSEPs) of four soils were generally less than
   0.017, while the coefficients of determination (R(2)s) of four soils
   were generally more than 0.85, and the ratios of the performance to
   deviation (RPDs) of four soils were greater than 2.5 (470-2400 nm).
   Therefore, the model has high prediction accuracy, and can be well
   applied to the prediction of water content in different sorts of soils.},

Abstract = {Substrate volumetric water content (VWC) is a useful measurement for
   automated irrigation systems. We have previously developed automated
   irrigation controllers that use capacitance sensors and dataloggers to
   supply plants with on-demand irrigation. However, the dataloggers and
   accompanying software used to build and program those controllers make
   these systems expensive. Relatively new, low-cost open-source
   microcontrollers provide an alternative way to build sensor-based
   irrigation controllers for both agricultural and domestic applications.
   We designed and built an automated irrigation system using a
   microcontroller, capacitance soil moisture sensors, and solenoid valves.
   This system effectively monitored and controlled VWC over a range of
   irrigation thresholds (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m(3).m(-3)) with `Panama
   Red' hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella) in a peat:perlite substrate. The
   microcontroller can be used with both regular 24-V alternating current
   (AC) solenoid valves and with latching 6- to 18-V direct current (DC)
   solenoid valves. The technology is relatively inexpensive
   (microcontroller and accessories cost \$107, four capacitance soil
   moisture sensors cost \$440, and four solenoid valves cost \$120,
   totaling \$667) and accessible. The irrigation controller required
   little maintenance over the course of a 41-day trial. The low cost of
   this irrigation controller makes it useful in many horticultural
   settings, including both research and production.},

Title = {Single-Probe Heat Pulse Method for Soil Water Content Determination:
   Comparison of Methods},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The estimation of soil thermal conductivity (lambda) using the
   single-probe heat pulse (SPHP) method is well known, but estimation of
   soil water content (theta) using the SPHP is poorly understood. In this
   study, we examined six methods-lambda, normalized cumulative temperature
   increase (TNcum), normalized maximum temperature increase (TNmax), and
   the reciprocals of each-for theta estimation using the SPHP. The
   temperature response curves of four soils at different theta were
   measured following 600-s heat pulses with heating strengths of about 6 W
   m(-1), from which lambda, TNcum, and TNmax values were determined. The
   maximum measurement errors of these three methods were 0.11 m3 m(-3) for
   the coarse sand and 0.01 m(3) m(-3) for the fine sand, sandy loam, and
   silty clay, except for 0.05 m(3) m(-3) for the fine sand by the
   lambda(theta) method. The predicted theta from all of the lambda, TNcum,
   and TNmax methods agreed well with that from the oven-dry method for all
   soils with the exception of the TNcum(theta) and TNmax(theta) methods
   for the coarse sand for theta > 0.20 m(3) m(-3). The measurement errors
   and theta predictions of the 1/lambda(theta) method were similar to that
   of the TNcum(theta) and TNmax(theta) methods, and that of the
   1/TNcum(theta) and 1/TNmax(theta) methods were similar to that of the
   lambda(theta) method. Because each of the six methods worked well for
   only some soils, improved estimations were obtained when the
   lambda(theta) method was combined with the 1/TNcum(theta) {[}or
   1/TNmax(theta)] method for coarse-textured soils and the 1/l(theta)
   method was combined with the TNcum(theta) {[}or TNmax(theta)] method for
   fine-textured soils.},

Abstract = {The newly-developed cosmic-ray method for measuring area-average soil
   moisture at the hectometer horizontal scale is being implemented in the
   COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (or the COSMOS). The
   stationary cosmic-ray soil moisture probe measures the neutrons that are
   generated by cosmic rays within air and soil and other materials,
   moderated by mainly hydrogen atoms located primarily in soil water, and
   emitted to the atmosphere where they mix instantaneously at a scale of
   hundreds of meters and whose density is inversely correlated with soil
   moisture. The COSMOS has already deployed more than 50 of the eventual
   500 cosmic-ray probes, distributed mainly in the USA, each generating a
   time series of average soil moisture over its horizontal footprint, with
   similar networks coming into existence around the world. This paper is
   written to serve a community need to better understand this novel method
   and the COSMOS project. We describe the cosmic-ray soil moisture
   measurement method, the instrument and its calibration, the design, data
   processing and dissemination used in the COSMOS project, and give
   example time series of soil moisture obtained from COSMOS probes.},

Title = {Soil water content and suction monitoring in model slopes for shallow
   flowslides early warning applications},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {35},
Number = {3-5},
Pages = {127-136},
Abstract = {The results of laboratory infiltration experiments on instrumented model
   slopes are presented. Loose granular volcanic ashes from the mountainous
   area north-eastern of Naples, responsible for several large flowslides
   during the last decades, have been tested. The experiments were aimed at
   a better understanding of the hydraulic processes leading to slope
   failure, in order to identify the most useful variables to be monitored
   for building up effective early warning systems. With respect to this,
   useful information was provided by coupled measurements of soil suction
   and volumetric water content, respectively carried out by
   minitensiometers and TDR, and by slope surface settlement measurements,
   made with optical laser sensors. In particular, monitoring of soil
   volumetric water content seemed more useful than soil suction monitoring
   for early warning purposes, since water content grew smoothly during the
   entire infiltration processes, while soil suction showed abrupt steep
   fronts. Furthermore, the obtained results showed how rainfall
   infiltration was significantly affected by soil volumetric collapse, in
   turn related to its initial porosity. In addition, during infiltration
   flume tests with soils showing volumetric collapse, suction resulted
   nearly in all cases much smaller than expected from laboratory water
   retention curves. Since steep slopes equilibrium is often guaranteed by
   cohesion increment due to suction under unsaturated conditions, the
   obtained results indicate that soil volumetric collapse may be
   responsible for flowslide triggering when soil is still unsaturated. (C)

Title = {Three-dimensional monitoring of soil water content in a maize field
   using Electrical Resistivity Tomography},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {17},
Number = {2},
Pages = {595-609},
Abstract = {A good understanding of the soil water content (SWC) distribution at the
   field scale is essential to improve the management of water, soil and
   crops. Recent studies proved that Electrical Resistivity Tomography
   (ERT) opens interesting perspectives in the determination of the SWC
   distribution in 3 dimensions (3-D). This study was conducted (i) to
   check and validate how ERT is able to monitor SWC distribution in a
   maize field during the late growing season; and (ii) to investigate how
   maize plants and rainfall affect the dynamics of SWC distribution. Time
   Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements were used to validate
   ERT-inverted SWC values. Evolution of water mass balance was also
   calculated to check whether ERT was capable of giving a reliable
   estimate of soil water stock evolution. It is observed that ERT was able
   to give the same average SWC as TDR (R-2 = 0.98). In addition, ERT gives
   better estimates of the water stock than TDR thanks to its higher
   spatial resolution. The high resolution of ERT measurements also allows
   for the discrimination of SWC heterogeneities. The SWC distribution
   showed that alternation of maize rows and inter-rows was the main
   influencing factor of the SWC distribution. The drying patterns were
   linked to the root profiles, with drier zones under the maize rows.
   During short periods, with negligible rainfall, the SWC decrease took
   place mainly in the two upper soil horizons and in the inter-row area.
   In contrast, rainfall increased the SWC mostly under the maize rows and
   in the upper soil layer. Nevertheless, the total amount of rainfall
   during the growing season was not sufficient to modify the SWC patterns
   induced by the maize rows. During the experimental time, there was
   hardly any SWC redistribution from maize rows to inter-rows. Yet,
   lateral redistribution from inter-rows to maize rows induced by
   potential gradient generates SWC decrease in the inter-row area and in
   the deeper soil horizons.},

Abstract = {Capacitance and resistivity sensors can be used to continuously monitor
   soil volumetric water content (theta) and pore-water electrical
   conductivity (ECp) with non-destructive methods. However, dielectric
   readings of capacitance sensors operating at low frequencies are
   normally biased by high soil electrical conductivity. A procedure to
   calibrate capacitance-resistance probes in saline conditions was
   implemented in contrasting soils. A low-cost capacitance-resistance
   probe (ECH2O-5TE, 70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) was used in
   five soils at four water contents (i.e., from dry conditions to
   saturation) and four salinity levels of the wetting solution (0, 5, 10,
   and 15 dS.m(-1)). theta was accurately predicted as a function of the
   dielectric constant, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), texture and
   organic carbon content, even in high salinity conditions. Four models to
   estimate pore-water electrical conductivity were tested and a set of
   empirical predicting functions were identified to estimate the model
   parameters based on easily available soil properties (e.g., texture,
   soil organic matter). The four models were reformulated to estimate ECp
   as a function of ECa, dielectric readings, and soil characteristics,
   improving their performances with respect to the original model
   formulation. Low-cost capacitance-resistance probes, if properly
   calibrated, can be effectively used to monitor water and solute dynamics
   in saline soils.},

Abstract = {The calibration and validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products
   relies upon an accurate source of ground truth data. The primary method
   of providing this ground truth is to conduct intensive field campaigns
   with manual surface soil moisture sampling measurements, which utilize
   gravimetric sampling, soil moisture probes, or both, to estimate the
   volumetric soil water content. Soil moisture probes eliminate the need
   for labor-intensive gravimetric sampling. To ensure the accuracy of
   these probes, several studies have determined these probes need various
   degrees of localized calibration. This study examines six possible
   calibration techniques using data collected during a field campaign
   conducted in 2012, with soil moisture samples being collected over 55
   fields in southern Manitoba, as part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive
   Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). The use of a general equation,
   applied to all collected data, resulted in the largest error regardless
   of whether a linear or third order polynomial relationship was
   established for the calibration of the soil moisture probes. Calibration
   equations based on soil texture or vegetation land cover reduced the
   error; however, the individual calibration equations established for
   each field in the study had the lowest error of all the calibration
   techniques. Although average bias was low for all of the calibration
   techniques, the use of the general equation to calibrate individual
   fields resulted in high biases for some fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Surface soil moisture is an important environment variable that is
   dominant in a variety of research and application areas. Acquiring
   spatiotemporal continuous soil moisture observations is therefore of
   great importance. Weather conditions can contaminate optical remote
   sensing observations on soil moisture, and the absence of remote sensors
   causes gaps in regional soil moisture observation time series.
   Therefore, reconstruction is highly motivated to overcome such
   contamination and to fill in such gaps. In this paper, we propose a
   novel image reconstruction algorithm that improved upon the Satellite
   and In situ sensor Collaborated Reconstruction (SICR) algorithm provided
   by our previous publication. Taking artificial neural networks as a
   model, complex and highly variable relationships between in situ
   observations and remote sensing soil moisture is better projected. With
   historical data for the network training, feedforward neural networks
   (FNNs) project in situ soil moisture to remote sensing soil moisture at
   better performances than conventional models. Consequently, regional
   soil moisture observations can be reconstructed under full cloud
   contamination or under a total absence of remote sensors. Experiments
   confirmed better reconstruction accuracy and precision with this
   improvement than with SICR. The new algorithm enhances the temporal
   resolution of high spatial resolution remote sensing regional soil
   moisture observations with good quality and can benefit multiple soil
   moisture-based applications and research.},

   temperature on the performance of the sensor is also discussed. The
   proposed signal conditioning circuit is implemented in printed circuit
   board to measure the output voltage with respect to capacitance change.
   Obtained results are transmitted through a global system for mobile
   communication module for remote observation of soil moisture. The
   thermogravimetric method is used for voltage to soil moisture
   calibration, and based on the experimental data, results are analyzed
   further. A review of some relevant fringing field capacitive sensors and
   their instrumentation system reported in past 7-8 years are studied for
   comparison with the proposed sensor system.},

Pages = {29846-29857},
Abstract = {An ultra-wide-band radar module sensor for soil moisture monitoring
   field experiment is investigated in this paper. For this type of mission
   critical sensor, it is applied to collect the reflected signals from
   subsurface of bare soil and sand with different volumetric water
   contents (VWCs) data (which are calibrated by a time domain
   reflectometer). This problem is formulated as a mapping from the raw
   data to the physical parameter. The fuzzy logic algorithm is employed to
   track the trend of the time series data and after the forecasting
   becomes stable, the parameters of membership functions in the final
   iteration are extracted as templates and the VWC values are computed
   based on a recognition fashion. Two type of fuzzy logic systems (FLSs),
   namely, type-1 FLS and interval type-2 FLS are employed and compared
   under the root-mean-square-error. Finally, the accuracy of the soil
   moisture retrieval is also compared under the mean absolute deviation
   and the root mean square difference, which demonstrates the
   effectiveness of the algorithm.},

Abstract = {The objective of this project was to determine if automatic residential
   irrigation systems with soil moisture sensor irrigation controllers
   could reduce irrigation water application while maintaining acceptable
   turfgrass quality as successfully in homes as in plot studies. Research
   was conducted on-site at cooperating homes (n = 58) in southwest
   Florida. Experimental treatments were (1) automatic timer with
   integration of bypass soil moisture sensor control system, (2) automatic
   timer with rain sensor and educational materials, (3) automatic timer
   with rain sensor, and (4) automatic timer only (typical for the region).
   Irrigation application, frequency, quarterly turf quality ratings, and
   weather data were collected over 26 months. Homes with soil moisture
   sensor irrigation controllers bypassed unneeded events during both rainy
   and dry periods, averaging 2 irrigation events per month; all other
   treatments averaged 4.5-6 events per month. Reduction in number of
   irrigation events by soil moisture sensor control systems resulted in
   significant savings, with 65\% cumulative reduction compared to homes
   with typical timer irrigation control. Observed on-site savings were
   comparable to previous plot research, indicating that plot savings could
   be scaled up so long as soil moisture control systems are installed and

Abstract = {We address the relationship between the electrical properties of water

   perspective, is based on the analysis of basic theories of capacitance
   sensor. For this principle, a high-frequency fringing electric field

   the sensor was calibrated to measure the volumetric water content (VWC).
   Experiments were conducted on standard samples from 1\% to 28.2\% VWC to
   show varying output frequency of soil moisture. Thus sensor response
   equation, with an R-square of 0.9697 and a 95\% confidence bound, was
   obtained. Comparing the relative changes of the same sample with the
   data illustrated by a benchmark sensor, the experimental results showed
   unanimous in stability and accuracy for commercial use. With the
   calibration and standardization of the system, a device for defining the
   soil water status will be available, which served the process of

Abstract = {Evaluation of a newly designed button heat pulse probe (BHPP)

   element and a central thermistor, both embedded in the face of a plastic
   disk (6 mm thick and 16 mm in diameter). After calibration of the
   effective heater-thermistor spacing from temperature response
   measurements in agar, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to
   demonstrate the potential advantages of the BHPP. Measurement accuracy
   and robustness of the BHPP were significantly improved compared with the
   conventional HPP. Errors associated with needle deflection were
   eliminated by the design, whereas the water content measurement
   sensitivity was increased by the central placement of the thermistor. We
   used inverse modeling with a finite-element heat transport model to
   illustrate the increased sensitivity of the BHPP to soil water content

Abstract = {Spatial and temporal patterns of soil water content (SWC) can not only
   improve the understanding of soil water processes but also the water
   management in the field. The spatial distribution of SWC depends on the
   spatial variability of soil attributes, vegetation and landscape
   features. The aim of this study was to evaluate: i) the spatial and
   temporal variability pattern in an agroecological system; ii) understand
   the factors affecting the spatial variations of SWC; iii) determine if
   wet and dry zones conserve their spatial position; iv) evaluate the
   possibility of using this information to reduce the number of SWC
   measurements. The experiment was carried out in an area of 2,502 m(2),
   where a regular grid with spacing of 10 m was laid out. At each point,
   time domain reflectometer sensors were installed at depths of 0.05,
   0.15, 0.30 m to monitor the SWC for 18 days in 2014 (Jan, Feb and Mar)
   and 9 days in 2014/2015 (Dec and Jan). The SWC, at the three soil
   depths, followed a similar and systematic pattern, being highest in the
   deepest layers, and exhibited temporal stability. The correlation
   between SWC and clay content varied both with the depth and the
   magnitude of SWC. During the wet season it is necessary to intensify the
   sampling density to estimate the SWC, while during the dry season the
   Spearman rank correlation remained high indicating the need for a small
   sampling effort only. The driest zones tend to conserve their spatial
   position more for a longer period than compared to wettest zones.},

Abstract = {Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems are increasingly being used in
   agriculture in attempts to use the available water more efficiently. The
   proper design and management of SDI systems requires knowledge of
   precise distribution of water around emitters. We conducted both field
   and numerical experiments to evaluate the soil water content

   patterns started to overlap. The experiments involved SDI systems with
   emitters installed at different depths and with different spacings along
   the drip lateral. The HYDRUS software package was used to analyze the
   field data, assuming modeling approaches in which emitters were
   represented as (i) a point source in an axisymmetrical two-dimensional
   domain, (ii) a line source in a planar two-dimensional domain, or (iii)
   a point source in a fully three-dimensional domain. Results indicated
   that SDI systems can be accurately described using an axisymmetrical
   two-dimensional model only before wetting patterns start to overlap, and
   a planar two-dimensional model only after full merging of the wetting
   fronts from neighboring emitters. A fully three-dimensional model
   appears to be required for describing subsurface drip irrigation

Abstract = {With the development of geographic information science and the progress

   multivariate geospatial data has attracted much attention. This paper
   discusses an IconMap-based visualisation technique that enables multiple

   achieved by extending the conventional pixel-based image structure to
   the three-tiered iconic design. Thereby the spatial pattern generated by
   the interaction between multivariate geographic variables can be
   disclosed, and the goal of geospatial data mining is achieved. A
   visualisation case study on soil organic matter and nutrients for the
   Shuangliu County of Chengdu City, China, was performed using the
   proposed approach. The result shows that the static IconMap can better
   display the distribution tendency of the high-end and low-end soil
   organic matter and nutrients, and that the dynamic IconMap can both
   reflect the interaction between the organic matter and the nutrients
   variables, and display the soil fertility levels in a comprehensive way.
   Thus, the IconMap-based visualisation approach is a non-fused,

Abstract = {Identifying the most suitable electromagnetic region is crucial in

   used in linear partial least-squares regression (PLS) analysis to
   predict P concentration of soils. Soils were analysed for water-soluble
   P, Mehlich-1 P, and total P. Partial least-squares regression results
   showed that strong relationships were found between reflectance and P
   concentration with coefficients of determination of 0-93, 0.95 and 0.76
   for total, Mehlich-1 and water-soluble P, respectively, in the near

Abstract = {The interference pattern technique (IPT) consists of the coherent
   addition of the direct and reflected global navigation satellite systems
   (GNSS) signals in the receiving antenna. The detected power oscillates
   (fading), and the amplitude of these oscillations is very sensitive to
   the soil reflection coefficient at the specular reflection point.
   Therefore, variations of the reflection coefficient can be mapped, and
   thus dielectric constant variations, from which soil moisture can be
   retrieved. This work extends the use of the IPT technique from vertical
   polarization (V-Pol) to horizontal polarization (H-Pol). Moreover, the
   IPT equations are reformulated to facilitate the combination of
   dual-polarization retrievals. Simulations of the interference patterns
   at V-and H-Pol are presented for different soil moisture conditions. An
   upgrade of the SMIGOL GNSS-R instrument for dual-polarization
   observations is presented. This instrument was deployed in a flat, dry
   grassland in Yanco, Australia, in order to validate the proposed
   concepts. Finally, a comparison between the data retrieved from the
   SMIGOL instrument and the ground-truth soil moisture data is presented
   showing a good agreement between them and rainfall information.},

Title = {A TDR Array Probe for Monitoring Near-Surface Soil Moisture Distribution},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},

Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Near-surface soil conditions (i.e., moisture and temperature) moderate
   mass and energy exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface. While remote
   sensing offers an effective means for mapping near-surface moisture
   content across large areas, in situ measurements, targeting those
   specific remotely sensed soil depths, are poorly understood and
   high-resolution near-surface measurement capabilities are lacking. Time
   domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established, accurate measurement
   method for soil dielectric permittivity and moisture content. A TDR
   array was designed to provide centimeter-resolution measurements of
   near-surface soil moisture. The array consists of nine stainless steel
   TDR rods spaced 1 cm apart, acting as wave-guide pairs to form eight
   two-rod TDR probes in series. A critical aspect of the design was
   matching the spacing of the coaxial cable-TDR rod transition to avoid
   unwanted reflections in the waveforms. The accuracy of the TDR array
   permittivity measurement (+/- 1 permittivity unit) was similar to that
   of conventional TDR as verified in dielectric liquids. Electric field
   numerical simulations showed minimal influence of adjacent rods during a
   given rod-pair measurement. The evaporation rate determined by the TDR
   array compared well with mass balance data in a laboratory test.
   Near-surface soil moisture profile dynamics were monitored at
   centimeter-depth resolution using the TDR array in a field experiment
   where volumetric moisture content estimates (0-8 cm) were within 2\% of
   conventional three-rod TDR probes averaging across 0 to 8 cm and from
   1-to 3-cm depths.},

   data logger and controlled using a relay driver connected to submersible
   pumps. As the substrate theta dropped below the thresholds, irrigation
   was turned on for 3 min followed by 3-min drainage. Capacitance sensors
   effectively controlled subirrigation by irrigating only when substrate
   theta dropped below the thresholds. Each irrigation cycle resulted in a
   rapid increase in substrate theta, from 0.10 to approximate to 0.33
   m(3).m(-3) with the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) irrigation threshold vs. an increase
   in theta from 0.42 to 0.49 m(3).m(-3) with the 0.42-m(3).m(-1)
   irrigation threshold. Less nutrient solution was used in the lower theta
   threshold treatments, indicating that sensor control can reduce water
   and thus fertilizer use in subirrigation systems. The water dynamics
   showed that the bottom part of the pots was saturated after irrigation
   with theta decreasing quickly after an irrigation event, presumably
   because of drainage. However, the water movement among substrate layers
   was slow with the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) irrigation threshold with water
   reaching the upper layer 5.5 to 20 h after irrigation. The
   0.10-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold resulted in 81\% fewer irrigations and
   70\% less nutrient solution use compared with the 0.42-m(3).m(-3) theta
   threshold. However, the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold also reduced
   hibiscus shoot height by 30\%, shoot dry weight 74\%, and compactness by
   63\% compared with the 0.42-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold. Our results
   indicate that soil moisture sensors can be used to control subirrigation
   based on plant water use and substrate water and to manipulate plant
   growth, thus providing a tool to improve control over plant quality in
   subirrigation systems.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture stress and salinity are considered as a major form of land
   degradation in rain-fed agricultural regions. The study has been carried
   out for four distinct periods such as 2001, 2005, 2010, and 2015 that
   was selected according to the climatic variations that occurred more
   than a decade. The multispectral remote sensing-based empirical models
   were employed on Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land
   Imager imageries to estimate the rate of soil moisture stress and
   salinity from 2001-2015. The rate of soil moisture stress has been
   magnified to 143\%, and salinity was increased by 70\% particularly from
   2005-2010 when the drought period occurred. The reliability of
   identifying the saline-affected soils from the multispectral remote
   sensing models was significantly affected (R-2=0.39) because of the
   extensive distribution of Nerium oleander plants and water logging state
   in the study region. The modified microwave water cloud model revealed
   the three-layer information such as N.oleander, soil, and vegetation
   such that an imaginary part of the dielectric constant derived from
   simplified Hallikainen empirical model has got good correlation
   (R-2=0.73) with ground electrical conductivity measurements. Copyright

Volume = {17},

Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Evaporation from bare soil surfaces can be restrained to a great extent
   with the development of a dry layer at the soil surface where capillary
   hydraulic conductance ceases and water flow proceeds only by gas phase
   transport. Model calculations and preliminary experiments with model
   porous media have shown that this surface layer can be very thin. An
   accurate characterization of these processes is required, which is
   provided by noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) methods. The evaporative
   drying of a silt loam and a sandy loam was monitored at high spatial
   resolution in laboratory experiments. The MR data were used to assess
   the performance of two numerical models: (i) the Richards equation,
   which considers isothermal liquid water flow, and (ii) a coupled soil
   water, heat, and vapor flow numerical model. The experimental results
   reveal two distinct drying regimes for both soil types where, at the
   onset of the second evaporation stage, a dry surface zone developed with
   increasing thickness over time. This layer revealed that water loss
   inside the soil coincided with a relatively low evaporation rate as the
   liquid continuity to the soil surface vanished. The modeling results
   clearly demonstrated the need to consider heat and vapor flow. It was
   shown, as a proof of principle, that MR relaxation time spectra may
   serve as a proxy to follow desaturation processes where spatially
   resolved transverse relaxation can reveal a secondary evaporation front.},

Abstract = {Drought is a globally relevant hazard, and while various studies have
   investigated the relationship between droughts and different climate and
   ecosystem variables, they are often not global or they do not make use
   of direct soil moisture observations. Here we use satellite derived soil
   moisture observations from the Climate Change Initiative of the European
   Space Agency to quantify the relation between soil moisture drought and
   temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and vegetation during the
   peak of the growing season. Furthermore, we follow the temporal
   evolution of the buildup and recovery surrounding the drought peak. We
   find that in many regions longer-term precipitation deficits are the
   driving factors of large negative soil moisture anomalies. At the peak
   of the dry period large anomalies are found for precipitation,
   evapotranspiration, and temperature, while vegetation indices often show
   a delayed response. This delay is likely related to the limited
   information contained in the remotely sensed soil moisture signal on the
   deeper root zone, thus underestimating the available soil moisture for
   plants. Anomalies over grasslands are generally larger than over
   forests, likely linked to the ability of trees to better access water at
   deeper depths, and to save water during dry conditions. These results
   illustrate the relevance of remote-sensing based soil moisture as a new
   independent observation for studying land-vegetation-atmosphere dynamics
   at the global scale. (C) 2017 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in the exchange of water and heat
   energy between the land and atmosphere and is used in studies of global
   climate change. Soil moisture data are also required for reservoir
   management, early warning of droughts, irrigation scheduling, and crop
   yield forecasting. Coastal soils in general span the gamut of soil
   properties necessary for agriculture and maintaining natural
   environments, including transitional wetlands. Beach characteristics,
   such as soil moisture, grain size and type, are needed for determining
   substrate-bearing strength, modeling beach erosion, and planning beach
   nourishment. Because microwave radiation from soil is strongly dependent
   on moisture content, soil moisture has traditionally been mapped with
   airborne microwave radiometers. Innovative antenna technology has
   enabled microwave radiometers on satellites, such as Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity and Aqua, to measure soil moisture on a global scale.
   Better corrections for surface roughness, vegetation cover, soil
   temperature, and topography must still be devised, and techniques for
   sensing soil moisture beyond the top few centimeters developed.},

Volume = {1},
Number = {1},
Pages = {3-21},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Satellite remote sensing observations have the potential for efficient
   and reliable mapping of spatial soil moisture distributions. However,
   soil moisture retrievals from active microwave remote sensing data are
   typically complex due to inherent difficulty in characterizing
   interactions among land surface parameters that contribute to the
   retrieval process. Therefore, adequate physical mathematical
   descriptions of microwave backscatter interaction with parameters such
   as land cover, vegetation density, and soil characteristics are not
   readily available. In such condition, non-parametric models could be
   used as possible alternative for better understanding the impact of
   variables in the retrieval process and relating it in the absence of
   exact formulation. In this study, non-parametric methods such as neural
   networks, fuzzy logic are used to retrieve soil moisture from active
   microwave remote sensing data. The inclusion of soil characteristics and
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from infrared and
   visible measurement, have significantly improved soil moisture
   retrievals and reduced root mean square error (RMSE) by around 30\% in
   the retrievals. Soil moisture derived from these methods was compared
   with ESTAR soil moisture (RMSE similar to 4.0\%) and field soil moisture
   measurements (RMSE similar to 6.5\%). Additionally, the study showed
   that soil moisture retrievals from highly vegetated areas are less
   accurate than bare soil areas.},

Abstract = {Argania spinosa is an endemic tree of Southwestern Morocco. It grows in
   arid regions, where annual rainfall ranges between 100 and 300 mm and
   where no other tree species can live. The aim of the study was to
   investigate, the root system architecture of Argania spinosa and the
   temporal dynamics of the root-zone moisture after a rain event, using a
   geophysical technique called Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI). This
   technique discriminates by its different resistivity, woody roots, dry
   soil and moist soil. We tested the ability of three different ERI
   profile configurations (Dipole-dipole, Wenner and Wenner-Schlumberger)
   to measure a correct two-dimensional profile. Six measurements (from
   April to July) of resistivity sections were performed along a 96 m
   linear transect that included eight trees. Midday shoot water potential
   (psi(md) and leaf relative water content (RWC) were measured during the
   experimental period, for the eight trees. The results showed that the
   Wenner configuration was the most appropriate discriminating
   resistivities of soil, soil moisture and roots. The 2D resistivity
   pseudo-sections obtained showed three different layers: one thin
   resistive layer interspersed by very resistant spots corresponding to
   woody roots, followed by a middle conductive one corresponding to moist
   soil, and a deeper layer with moderate resistivities. Moisture content
   changed substantially over time; being lower over summer than in spring.
   ERI profiles showed that the resistive layer corresponding to the argan
   roots, was located between 0 and 4 m of depth. The analysis of the 2D
   resistivity pseudosections revealed significant differences in soil
   moisture distribution; so that in the zone under argan roots, soil
   moisture could be measured down to 6 m deep throughout the whole study
   period, whereas in the zone outside argan roots, moisture was depleted
   as early as May down the whole profile.
   As expected, psi(md), showed minimal values in summer, dropping to -3.3
   MPa at the end of the experiment. RWC exhibited a similar pattern. Based
   on the ERI measuring we conclude that argan roots were not exploiting
   deep water from the aquifer; instead, they are using soil water at few
   meters deep. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {180},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {99-114},

Abstract = {This paper presents the comparison of three global soil moisture
   products (ASCAT, AMSR and SMOS) versus a. land surface model over a
   region representative of several Mediterranean landscapes located in the
   Northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. Our approach has been for
   agricultural and water management applications at the regional and local
   scale. Despite being a rather small area, we were able to observe
   different signal behaviours corresponding to major land cover classes in
   Mediterranean areas i.e.: dryland and irrigated crops, forests and
   natural vegetation (grass-shrubs). The area also allowed assessing the
   impact of topography. The first result of the study is that the results
   are very dependent on the normalizations used to make the data
   comparable, thus their impact must be carefully analysed. In this study,
   we applied two different normalisation methods (called ZV35 and ZV) and
   different moving average windows (1, 10 and 30 days) in order to enhance
   seasonal effects. Using no smoothing window, ASCAT is the soil moisture
   product that correlates best with the LSM over all cover classes,
   whatever the method. Using smoothing window, AMSR-E tends to outperform
   other soil moisture products with the ZV method. The ZV35 method is not
   able to identify a small heavily irrigated area. The reason for these
   different results is that ZV35, tends to eliminate the monthly scale
   soil moisture memory and therefore becomes more sensitive to
   precipitation and less sensitive to the monthly evolution of superficial
   soil moisture. The comparison shows in general good agreement for all
   soil moisture products with the LSM on the temporal series simulated
   over flat, non irrigated areas which are not close to the sea. SMOS has
   difficulties in areas close to the sea and in areas with steep relief
   and the current version of the L2 Operational Algorithm (V5.51) depicts
   few values in forested areas. ASCAT, in its turn, shows some limitations
   over agricultural and natural vegetation where it shows an increase of
   soil moisture from June to October probably due to increase of
   penetration depth in dry soil moisture conditions. AMSR-E LPRM shows a
   clear vegetation cycle over all the land cover classes. From all the
   remote sensing products, SMOS is the only one able to see irrigation and
   the only that does not show clear vegetation or roughness effects. In
   this study, we were able to assess the impact of higher resolution soil
   moisture products to map irrigated areas. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Journal = {NORDIC HYDROLOGY},

Abstract = {Microwave remote sensing of soil moisture has been an active area of
   research since the 1970s but has yet found little use in operational
   applications. Given recent advances in retrieval algorithms and the
   approval of a dedicated soil moisture satellite, it is time to re-assess
   the potential of various satellite systems to provide soil moisture
   information for hydrologic applications in an operational fashion. This
   paper reviews recent progress made with retrieving surface soil moisture
   from three types of microwave sensors - radiometers, Synthetic Aperture
   Radars (SARs), and scatterometers. The discussion focuses on the
   operational readiness of the different techniques, considering
   requirements that are typical for hydrological applications. It is
   concluded that operational coarse-resolution (25 - 50 km) soil moisture
   products can be expected within the next few years from radiometer and
   scatterometer systems, while scientific and technological breakthroughs
   are still needed for operational soil moisture retrieval at finer scales
   (< 1 km) from SAR. Also, further research on data assimilation methods
   is needed to make best use of the coarse-resolution surface soil
   moisture data provided by radiometer and scatterometer systems in a
   hydrologic context and to fully assess the value of these data for
   hydrological predictions.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important hydrologic state variable critical to
   successful hydroclimatic and environmental predictions. Soil moisture
   varies both in space and time because of spatio-temporal variations in
   precipitation, soil properties, topographic features, and vegetation
   characteristics. In recent years, air- and space-borne remote sensing
   campaigns have successfully demonstrated the use of passive microwave
   remote sensing to map soil moisture status near the soil surface
   (approximate to 0-0.05 m below the ground) at various spatial scales. In
   this study root zone (e.g., approximate to 0-0.6 m below the ground)
   soil moisture distributions were estimated across the Little Washita
   watershed (Oklahoma) by assimilating near-surface soil moisture data
   from remote sensing measurements using the Electronically Scanned
   Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
   technique coupled with a numerical one-dimensional vadose zone flow
   model (HYDRUS-ET). The resulting distributed root zone soil moisture
   assessment tool (SMAT) is based on the concept of having parallel
   noninteracting streamtubes (hydrologic units) within a geographic
   information system (GIS) platform. The simulated soil moisture
   distribution at various depths and locations within the watershed were
   compared with measured profile soil moisture data using time domain
   reflectometry (TDR). A reasonable agreement was found under favorable
   conditions between footprint-scale model estimations and point-scale
   field soil moisture measurements in the root zone. However,
   uncertainties introduced by precipitation and soil hydraulic properties
   caused suboptimal performance of the integrated model. The SMAT holds
   great promise and offers flexibility to incorporate various data
   assimilation techniques, scaling, and other hydrological complexities
   across large landscapes. The integrated model can be useful for
   simulating profile soil moisture estimation and for predicting transient
   soil moisture behavior for a range of hydrological and environmental
   applications.},

   Brazilian semiarid region. The empirical relationship had previously
   been tested for irrigated soils in Mexico, Egypt, and Pakistan, with
   promising results. In this study, the relationship was evaluated from
   experimental data collected from a cotton field. The experiment was
   carried out in an area of 5 ha with irrigated cotton. The energy balance
   and evaporative fraction (L) were measured by the Bowen ratio method.
   Soil moisture (q) data were collected using a PR2 - Profile Probe
   (Delta-T Devices Ltd). The empirical relationship was tested using
   experimentally collected L and q values and was applied using the L
   values obtained from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land
   (SEBAL) and three TM - Landsat 5 images. There was a close correlation
   between measured and estimated q values (p<0.05, R-2 = 0.84) and there
   were no significant differences according to the Student t-test
   (p<0.01). The statistical analyses showed that the empirical
   relationship can be applied to estimate the root-zone soil moisture of
   irrigated soils, i.e. when the evaporative fraction is greater than
   0.45.},

Title = {Surface soil moisture retrievals from remote sensing: Current status,
   products \& future trends},
Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {83-84},
Pages = {36-56},
Abstract = {Advances in Earth Observation (EO) technology, particularly over the
   last two decades, have shown that soil moisture content (SMC) can be
   measured to some degree or other by all regions of the electromagnetic
   spectrum, and a variety of techniques have been proposed to facilitate
   this purpose.
   In this review we provide a synthesis of the efforts made during the
   last 20 years or so towards the estimation of surface SMC exploiting EO
   imagery, with a particular emphasis on retrievals from microwave
   sensors. Rather than replicating previous overview works, we provide a
   comprehensive and critical exploration of all the major approaches
   employed for retrieving SMC in a range of different global ecosystems.
   In this framework, we consider the newest techniques developed within
   optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, active and passive
   microwave domains, as well as assimilation or synergistic approaches.
   Future trends and prospects of EO for the accurate determination of SMC
   from space are subject to key challenges, some of which are identified
   and discussed within.
   It is evident from this review that there is potential for more accurate
   estimation of SMC exploiting EO technology, particularly so, by
   exploring the use of synergistic approaches between a variety of EO
   instruments. Given the importance of SMC in Earth's land surface
   interactions and to a large range of applications, one can appreciate
   that its accurate estimation is critical in addressing key scientific
   and practical challenges in today's world such as food security,
   sustainable planning and management of water resources. The launch of
   new, more sophisticated satellites strengthens the development of
   innovative research approaches and scientific inventions that will
   result in a range of pioneering and ground-breaking advancements in the
   retrievals of soil moisture from space. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {The ground truth estimated by in situ measurements is important for
   accurately evaluating retrieved remote sensing products, particularly
   over heterogeneous land surfaces. This letter analyzes the role of
   multisource remote sensing observations on the upscaling of soil
   moisture observed by a wireless sensor network at the pixel scale via
   the regression kriging (RK) method. Three types of auxiliary remote
   sensing information are employed, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal
   Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Temperature Vegetation
   Dryness Index (TVDI; 90 m), Polarimetric L-band Multiband Radiometer
   brightness temperature (700 m), and Moderate Resolution Image
   Spectroradiometer TVDI (1000 m). Moreover, a comparison with the
   ordinary kriging method is analyzed. The spatial inferences show that
   the RK method is more accurate and that its spatial pattern is more
   consistent with the auxiliary data when the trend is successfully
   removed, particularly when spatial continuity is destroyed by
   irrigation. The ASTER TVDI has a higher resolution and stronger
   correlation with soil moisture and yields more accurate interpolation
   results than the other types of remote sensing information. Although
   medium-resolution data do not substantially contribute to capture the
   spatial patterns of soil moisture, such data may still improve the
   prediction accuracy.},

Title = {Estimation of Soil Moisture from Optical and Thermal Remote Sensing: A
   Review},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies,
   soil moisture (SM) influences the exchange of water and energy at the
   interface between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate estimate of
   the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical for numerous
   large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing
   provides many algorithms to obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and
   SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are almost low
   resolution and not applicable in small catchment or field scale.
   Estimations of SM from optical and thermal remote sensing have been
   studied for many years and significant progress has been made. In
   contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive
   and systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for
   estimating SM. The physical basis and status of the estimation methods
   are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important and latest
   advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have
   been shown in this paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote
   sensing mainly depends on the relationship between SM and the surface
   reflectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing
   methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or
   variations of surface temperature/vegetation index. These approaches
   often have complex derivation processes and many approximations.
   Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed
   data can provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover,
   the advantages and weaknesses of different approaches are compared and
   applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil moisture
   estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested
   solutions are proposed for future research.},

   active microwave remote sensing of soil moisture will be emphasized. The
   passive microwave remote sensing of soil moisture has a long research

   sensing footprints},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2007},
Volume = {30},
Number = {4},
Pages = {883-896},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Remote sensing of soil moisture effectively provides soil moisture at a
   large scale, but does not explain highly heterogeneous soil moisture
   characteristics within remote sensing footprints. In this study, field
   scale spatio-temporal variability of root zone soil moisture was
   analyzed. During the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), daily soil
   moisture profiles (i.e., 0-6, 5-11, 15-21, and 25-31 cm) were measured
   in two fields in Walnut Creek watershed, Ames, Iowa, USA. Theta probe
   measurements of the volumetric soil moisture profile data were used to
   analyze statistical moments and time stability and to validate soil
   moisture predicted by a simple physical model simulation. For all
   depths, the coefficient of variation of soil moisture is well explained
   by the mean soil moisture using an exponential relationship. The simple
   model simulated very similar variability patterns as those observed.
   As soil depth increases, soil moisture distributions shift from skewed
   to normal patterns. At the surface depth, the soil moisture during dry
   down is log-normally distributed, while the soil moisture is normally
   distributed after rainfall. At all depths below the surface, the normal
   distribution captures the soil moisture variability for all conditions.
   Time stability analyses show that spatial patterns of sampling points
   are preserved for all depths and that time stability of surface
   measurements is a good indicator of subsurface time stability. The most
   time stable sampling sites estimate the field average root zone soil
   moisture value within +/- 2.1\% volumetric soil moisture. (c) 2006

Title = {A New Method of Preparing Gel for DGT Technique and Application to the
   Soil Phosphorus Availability Test},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {47},
Number = {10},
Pages = {1239-1251},
Abstract = {There are different methods for soil phosphorus (P) availability
   assessment. Researchers have recently introduced a new method called
   diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) to evaluate P availability in
   soils. The aim of this study was manufacturing DGT gel using
   copolymerization of acrylamide and allylic double bonds agarose to
   replace the patented agarose as a cross-linker. We evaluated the
   efficacy of the prepared gel and used the assembled DGT with that gel in
   10 calcareous soils. We compared the available P measured with the
   assembled DGT in those soils to Olsen's P measured in the same soils.
   Corn plant (Zea mays L.) was also grown in those soils in a greenhouse
   for two months. Results showed that the diffusion coefficient of P ions
   in the gel with 0.3\% of allylagarose at 25 degrees C was 6.9 {*} 10(-6)
   cm(2) . s(-1), implying that P ions were allowed to diffuse freely
   through the prepared diffusive gel. Measured P by the assembled DGT
   showed a close linear correlation (r(2) = 0.98) with the P
   concentrations measured in soil solutions extracted by the Olsen method.
   This demonstrates the prepared allylagarose cross-linked gels'
   efficiency and thus the reliability of the assembled DGT in easily and
   rapidly measuring the soil's available P. The P, as measured by the
   assembled DGT in the examined soils, indicated a little lower
   correlation coefficient (r = 0.77) than those measured by the Olsen
   method (r = 0.88). However, the CE values measured by DGT showed a good
   correlation with P uptake by the roots (r = 0.88, p = 0.01). The best
   correlation between CE and P content in corn occurred for the
   measurements made after 48 h of DGT placement in soils. The 20-h
   measurements had about the same r value, indicating that 20 h is
   sufficient for the placement of DGT assembly in the soil before its
   removing and measuring the available P. According to our findings,
   acrylamide-allylagarose gel as a diffusive gel in DGT was found to be
   suitable for P measurements in both aqueous solutions and soil.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {15},
Number = {3},

Abstract = {Knowledge of soil water content plays a key role in water management
   efforts to improve irrigation efficiency. Among the indirect estimation
   methods of soil water content via Earth Observation data is the triangle
   method, used to analyze optical and thermal features because these are
   primarily controlled by water content within the near-surface
   evaporation layer and root zone in bare and vegetated soils. Although
   the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer theory describes the ongoing
   processes, theoretical models reveal limits for operational use. When
   applying simplified empirical formulations, meteorological forcing could
   be replaced with alternative variables when the above-canopy temperature
   is unknown, to mitigate the effects of calibration inaccuracies or to
   account for the temporal admittance of the soil. However, if applied
   over a limited area, a characterization of both dry and wet edges could
   not be properly achieved; thus, a multi-temporal analysis can be
   exploited to include outer extremes in soil water content. A diachronic
   empirical approach introduces the need to assume a constancy of other
   meteorological forcing variables that control thermal features. Airborne
   images were acquired on a Sicilian vineyard during most of an entire
   irrigation period (fruit-set to ripening stages, vintage 2008), during
   which in situ soil water content was measured to set up the triangle
   method. Within this framework, we tested the triangle method by
   employing alternative thermal forcing. The results were inaccurate when
   air temperature at airborne acquisition was employed. Sonic and
   aerodynamic air temperatures confirmed and partially explained the
   limits of simultaneous meteorological forcing, and the use of proxy
   variables improved model accuracy. The analysis indicates that high
   spatial resolution does not necessarily imply higher accuracies.},

   Australia},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Volume = {537},

Abstract = {The high spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture complicates the
   validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products using in situ
   monitoring stations. Therefore, a standard methodology for selecting the
   most representative stations for the purpose of validating satellites
   and land surface models is essential. Based on temporal stability and
   geostatistical studies using long-term soil moisture records, intensive
   ground measurements and airborne soil moisture products, this study
   investigates the representativeness of soil moisture monitoring stations
   within the Yanco study area for the validation of NASA's Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) products at 3 km for radar, 9 km for radar
   radiometer and 36 km for radiometer pixels. This resulted in the
   identification of a number of representative stations according to the
   different scales. Although the temporal stability method was found to be
   suitable for identifying representative stations, stations based on the
   mean relative difference (MRD) were not necessarily the most
   representative of the areal average. Moreover, those identified from
   standard deviation of the relative difference (SDRD) may be dry-biased.
   It was also found that in the presence of heterogeneous land use,
   stations should be weighted based on proportions of agricultural land.
   Airborne soil moisture products were also shown to provide useful a
   priori information for identifying representative locations. Finally,
   recommendations are made regarding the design of future networks for
   satellite validation, and specifically the most representative stations
   for the Yanco area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   ECns of 2.4 dS m(-1). Once (+)SAL commenced, SWC (0-20-cm depth)
   increased rapidly and then remained approximately 30\% higher than in
   the control. Soil matric potential (SMP, 10-cm depth) was consistently
   very similar in both treatments. In Exp. 2, increasing ECns from 2.1 to
   5.5 dS m(-1) in irrigation treatments receiving 100\% of crop
   evaporation (ETc) and 25\% of ETc caused SWC (0-20 cm) to respectively
   increase appreciably and maintain relatively constant values. Experiment
   3 examined the effect of increased salinity and whether normalizing
   sensors with higher ECns alleviated this effect. Treatments were equal
   volumes of: (i) ECns of 5 dS m(-1) with sensor normalization at EC of
   5.2 dS m(-1) (SAL-N5.2); (ii) ECns of 5 dS m(-1) with normalization at
   EC of 1.9 dS m(-1) (SAL-N1.9); and (iii) ECns of 1.9 dS m(-1) with
   normalization at 1.9 ds m(-1) (control). Previously, the three
   treatments were fertigated with ECns of 1.9 dS m(-1). The SWC (5-15 cm)
   increased by approximately 10\% in both SAL-N5.2 and SAL-N1.9, and
   maintained relatively constant values in the control. The SMP (10 cm)
   was consistently very similar in the three treatments. Normalizing the
   CS at 5.2 or 1.9 dS m(-1) had no effect on the response to salinity. In
   the three experiments, changes in SWC generally paralleled changes in EC
   of soil water (ECsw,); relative increases were 4 to 7.5\% in SWC for
   each 1 dS m(-1) increase in ECsw.},

Title = {Evaluation of soil water content in tilled and cover-cropped olive
   orchards by the geoelectrical technique},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {163},
Number = {3-4},
Pages = {163-170},
Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) was performed in southern Italy,
   under semi-arid climate, on a Haplic Calcisol soil of two rainfed olive
   orchards managed according to different soil management (Tillage - T,
   and Cover Cropping - CC), applied for 8 years. The main aim was to test
   the usefulness of such geoelectrical method for the assessment of
   spatial and temporal variability of soil water content for water balance
   studies. For that purpose, the quality of univariate relationships
   between soil electrical resistivity (rho) and volumetric soil water
   content (theta(v)) was tested.
   Three geoelectrical measurement campaigns were performed in the
   autumn-spring period of 2006-2007. For each campaign, 3 two-dimensional
   (2-D) geoelectrical tomographies were carried out in the pole-dipole
   array using a fixed electrode spacing of 0.25 m. 2-D apparent
   resistivity pseudosection data sets have been inverted using the
   software TomoLabe (R). Each covered soil section was 3 m in depth and
   11.5 m long. On 14 November 2006 and 18 April 2007 campaigns the ERI
   were followed by soil samplings carried out with auger directly below
   the respective geoelectrical profiles. Direct measurements of soil
   electrical conductivity and soil water content were conducted on the
   soil samples in situ and in the laboratory.
   Volumetric soil water content, theta(v) (mm mm(-1)), was significantly
   related to soil electrical resistivity data, rho (Omega m), by the
   exponential model theta(v) = 1.641 rho(-0.599) (R = 0.866, n = 84). This
   relation allowed to assess the change of soil water content in the two
   orchards during the autumn-spring period and to reveal that the CC plot
   was more efficient to intercept and store rainwater. ERI technique
   allowed to highlight differences between the systems in the dynamics of
   water distribution along the soil profile as an effect of the adopted
   soil management. In particular, such technique consented to easily
   evaluate the extent of water content of the deepest soil layers (>1.0 m)
   evidencing a significant water reserve in the CC plot, convenient for
   the root system of rainfed olive trees in the driest months. Finally,
   the soil water content evaluated by means of the ERI technique was used
   for the short-term application of soil water balance which showed
   interesting data on the progress of water consumption during the
   autumn-spring period, particularly useful as operative indications for
   cover crops management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {The Second Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI1): A Combined
   Drought Monitoring Method with Soil Moisture and Vegetation Index},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {41},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Since soil moisture and vegetation index are direct and important
   indicators for surface drought status, a new drought monitoring method
   (MPDI1) is developed in NIR-Red reflectance space. It is a combination
   of two satellite-derived variables-a soil moisture component using the
   Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), and a vegetation component using the
   Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI). Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus
   (ETM+) image and in-situ ground observation are introduced to validate
   the accuracy of the proposed method. Results indicate that MPDI1 is
   highly consistent to the in-situ ground observation with the coefficient
   of determination (R-2 = 0.49) between MPDI1 and 5-20 cm mean soil
   moisture, which is slightly higher than the coefficient of determination
   (R-2 = 0.42) between MPDI1 and 10 cm soil moisture. Compared with
   drought indices such as PDI and the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index
   (MPDI), MPDI1 provides quite similar trends for bare soil or lower
   vegetated surface, but it demonstrates a better performance in measuring
   densely vegetated surface. This paper concludes that MPDI1 provides
   correct and sufficient information on surface drought status in
   soil-plant continuum, which appears to have robust available and great
   potential for surface drought estimation in China and other countries.},

   instrument implementing the Interference Pattern GNSS-R Technique},
Journal = {RADIO SCIENCE},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {46},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Reflectometry using Global Navigation Satellite Systems signals (GNSSR)
   has been the focus of many studies during the past few years for a
   number of applications over different scenarios as land, ocean or snow
   and ice surfaces. In the past decade, its potential has increased
   yearly, with improved receivers and signal processors, from generic GNSS
   receivers whose signals were recorded in magnetic tapes to instruments
   that measure full Delay Doppler Maps (the power distribution of the
   reflected GNSS signal over the 2-D space of delay offsets and Doppler
   shifts) in real time. At present, these techniques are considered to be
   promising tools to retrieve geophysical parameters such as soil
   moisture, vegetation height, topography, altimetry, sea state and ice
   and snow thickness, among others. This paper focuses on the land
   geophysical retrievals (topography, vegetation height and soil moisture)
   performed from a ground-based instrument using the Interference Pattern
   Technique (IPT). This technique consists of the measurement of the power
   fluctuations of the interference signal resulting from the simultaneous
   reception of the direct and the reflected GNSS signals. The latest
   experiment performed using this technique over a maize field is shown in
   this paper. After a review of the previous results, this paper presents
   the latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field.
   This new study provides a deeper analysis on the soil moisture retrieval
   by observing three irrigation-drying cycles and comparing them to
   different depths soil moisture probes. Furthermore, the height of the
   maize, almost 300 cm, has allowed testing the capabilities of the
   technique over dense and packed vegetation layers, with high vegetation

Title = {Two-dimensional monitoring of soil water content in fields with plastic
   mulching using electrical resistivity tomography},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {159},
Pages = {84-91},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Plastic mulching (PM) has become an important agricultural practice to
   improve crop yields worldwide, while there is still a lack of methods to
   quantify the complex spatial variations of soil water content (SWC) in
   the PM field. In this study, a methodology for using Electrical
   Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to get SWC information in the PM field was
   presented. Its performance in monitoring SWC was validated, and the
   spatial variation of SWC was analyzed using the ERT results. A
   simplified Waxman and Smits model was selected to calibrate the
   pedophysical relationship, and it showed good performance (coefficient
   of determination > 0.92). With the calibrated model, the SWC obtained
   using ERT showed good agreement with soil moisture sensors in different
   soil layers (RMSE < 0.027 cm(3) cm(-3)). The ERT results showed that
   rainfall and drying events have different effects on SWC at different
   growing stages. At the early stage, rainfall and drying events mainly
   influenced SWC on the bare strip, while at the later stage, rainfall and
   drying events had more obvious effects on the zone near the planting
   hole. On a seasonal scale, a higher SWC was not only found in the middle
   part of the mulched strip, but also in the bare strip, while a lower SWC
   was found in positions near the planting hole. At the same time, a
   high-resolution ERT measurement revealed that the SWC was also largely
   influenced by the soil heterogeneity. As such, SWC in the mulched strip
   was not necessarily higher than in the bare strip as we had supposed,
   but showed a high degree of irregularity in two dimensions. Considering
   the irregularity of SWC in two dimensions, our study calls for replacing
   point-scale measurement with two-dimensional monitoring methods when
   acquiring SWC information in a field with PM.},

Title = {Water Use and Growth of <i>Hibiscus acetosella</i> `Panama Red' Grown
   with a Soil Moisture Sensor-controlled Irrigation System},
Journal = {HORTSCIENCE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {48},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {Efficient water use is becoming increasingly important for horticultural
   operations to satisfy regulations regarding runoff along with adapting
   to the decreasing availability of water to agriculture. Generally, best
   management practices (BMPs) are used to conserve water. However, BMPs do
   not account for water requirements of plants. Soil moisture sensors can
   be used along with an automated irrigation system to irrigate when
   substrate volumetric water content (theta) drops below a set threshold,
   allowing for precise irrigation control and improved water conservation
   compared with traditional irrigation practices. The objective of this
   research was to quantify growth of Hibiscus acetosella `Panama Red'
   (PP\#20,121) in response to various theta thresholds. Experiments were
   performed in a greenhouse in Athens, GA, and on outdoor nursery pads in
   Watkinsville and Tifton, GA. Soil moisture sensors were used to maintain
   theta above specific thresholds (0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35,
   0.40, and 0.45 m(3).m(-3)). Shoot dry weight increased from 7.3 to 58.8
   g, 8.0 to 50.6 g, and from 3.9 to 35.9 g with increasing theta
   thresholds from 0.10 to 0.45 m(3).m(-3) in the greenhouse, Watkinsville,
   and Tifton studies, respectively. Plant height also increased with
   increasing theta threshold in all studies. Total irrigation volume
   increased with increasing theta threshold from 1.9 to 41.6 L/plant, 0.06
   to 23.0 L/plant, and 0.24 to 33.6 L/plant for the greenhouse,
   Watkinsville, and Tifton studies, respectively. Daily light integral
   (DLI) was found to be the most important factor influencing daily water
   use (DWU) in the greenhouse study; DWU was also found to be low on days
   with low DLI in nursery studies. In all studies, increased irrigation
   volume led to increased growth; however, water use efficiency (grams of
   shoot dry weight produced per liters of water used) decreased for theta
   thresholds above 0.35 m(3).m(-3). Results from the greenhouse and
   nursery studies indicate that sensor-controlled irrigation is feasible
   and that theta thresholds can be adjusted to control plant growth.},

Abstract = {This paper shows the application of a water balance based on remote
   sensing that integrated a Landsat 5 series from 2009 in an area of 1,300
   km(2) in the Duero Basin (Spain). The objective was to simulate the
   daily soil water content (SWC), actual evapotranspiration, deep
   percolation and irrigation rates. The accuracy of the application is
   tested in a semi-arid Mediterranean agricultural landscape with crops
   over natural conditions. The results of the simulated SWC were compared
   against 19 in situ stations of the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations
   Network (REMEDHUS), in order to check the feasibility and accuracy of
   the application. The theoretical basis of the application was the FAO56
   calculation assisted by remotely sensed imagery. The basal crop
   coefficient (K-cb), as well as other parameters of the calculation came
   from the remote reflectance of the images. This approach was implemented
   in the computerized tool HIDROMORE+, which integrates various spatial
   databases. The comparison of simulated and observed values (at different
   depths and different land uses) showed a good global agreement for the
   area (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.031 m(3)m(-3), and bias = -0.027 m(3)m(-3)).
   The land uses better described were rainfed cereals (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE =
   0.030 m(3)m(-3), and bias = -0.025 m(3)m(-3)) and vineyards (R-2 = 0.86,
   RMSE = 0.016 m(3)m(-3), and bias = -0.013 m(3)m(-3)). In general, an
   underestimation of the soil water content is noticed, more pronounced
   into the root zone than at surface layer. The final aim was to convert
   the application into a hydrological tool available for agricultural
   water management.},

Abstract = {The inversion of remote sensing images is crucial for soil moisture

   proposes a remote sensing observation sharing-method based on cloud

   distributed database and Apache Hadoop as the cloud computing service,
   this study achieves a high-throughput method for remote sensing
   observation storage and distribution. The map, reduced algorithms and
   the table structure design in distributed databases are then explained.
   Along the Yangtze River, the longest river in China, Hubei Province was
   selected as the study area to test the proposed framework. Using GF-1 as
   a data source, an experiment was performed to enhance earth observation
   data (EOD) storage and achieve large-scale soil moisture mapping. The
   proposed ROSCC can be applied to enhance EOD sharing in cloud computing

Title = {Comparison of four soil moisture sensor types under field conditions in
   Switzerland},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {430},
Pages = {39-49},
Month = {APR 2},
Abstract = {Many environmental and hydrological applications require knowledge about
   soil moisture. Its measurement accuracy is known to depend on the sensor
   technique, which is sensitive to soil characteristics such as texture,
   temperature, bulk density and salinity. However, the calibration
   functions provided by instrument manufacturers are generally developed
   under laboratory conditions, and their accuracy for field applications
   is rarely investigated, in particular over long time periods and in
   comparison with other sensors types. In this paper, four side-by-side
   profile soil moisture measurements down to 110 cm using three low-cost
   sensors and one high-accuracy and high-cost time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) sensor are compared over a 2-year period at a clay loam site in
   Switzerland. The low-cost instruments include the (1) 10HS (Decagon
   Devices, United States), (2) CS616 (Campbell Scientific, United States),
   and (3) SISOMOP (SMG University of Karlsruhe, Germany) sensors, which
   are evaluated against the (4) TDR-based TRIME-IT/-EZ (IMKO GmbH,
   Germany) sensors. For the comparison, the calibration functions provided
   by the manufacturers are applied for each sensor type. The sensors are
   evaluated based on daily data regarding their representation of the
   volumetric water content (VWC) and its anomalies, as well as the
   respective temperature dependency of the measurements. Furthermore, for
   each sensor type the actual evapotranspiration is estimated using the
   soil water balance approach and compared with measurements from a
   weighing lysimeter. It is shown that the root mean square difference
   (RMSD) of VWC for the low-cost sensors compared to the TDR measurements
   are up to 0.3 m(3)/m(3), with highest values in near-surface layers.
   However, the RMSD for the VWC anomalies are lower compared to those for
   absolute values. We conclude that under the studied conditions none of
   the evaluated low-cost sensors has a level of performance consistent
   with the respective manufacturer specifications. Hence the derivation of
   site-specific calibration functions is vital for the interpretation of
   measurements with low-cost soil moisture sensors. Furthermore, some
   weaknesses of the tested low-cost sensors such as the lack of
   sensitivity in certain soil moisture regimes or spurious dependency on
   soil temperature, imply intrinsic issues with the measurements derived
   with this type of instruments. This is particularly critical for a
   number of environmental and hydrological applications, including the
   assessment of remote sensing measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Precision irrigation is crucial in decreasing water demands of irrigated
   agriculture, which account for the largest source of water withdrawal in
   most regions. One necessity of precision irrigation is the knowledge of
   soil moisture content in the root zone of irrigated crops. Dielectric
   soil moisture sensors can provide this information at a relatively low
   cost (\$100) compared with other techniques; however, their accuracy
   cannot be guaranteed in all soils without site-specific calibration, the
   need for which has limited the use of these sensors. This study examined
   the Decagon 10HS soil moisture sensor in order to determine the accuracy
   of the manufacturer-supplied calibration equation on southwest Florida
   (SWFL) agricultural soils, and analyze whether it performs consistently
   in different soils found in SWFL. Laboratory calibration of the 10HS was
   done on four SWFL soils that represent the majority of agricultural land
   in the region and regression calibration equations were obtained. It was
   found that the manufacturer calibration equation does not accurately
   predict soil volumetric water content (VWC) within the +/- 3\% accuracy
   range specified for the sensor, meriting the need for site-specific
   calibration. Additionally, it was found that all tested soils behave
   very similarly, allowing the development of a single calibration

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in the land-atmosphere
   exchange process. Spatial estimation based on multi in situ (network)
   data is a critical way to understand the spatial structure and variation
   of land surface soil moisture. Theoretically, integrating densely
   sampled auxiliary data spatially correlated with soil moisture into the
   procedure of spatial estimation can improve its accuracy. In this study,
   we present a novel approach to estimate the spatial pattern of soil
   moisture by using the BME method based on wireless sensor network data
   and auxiliary information from ASTER (Terra) land surface temperature
   measurements. For comparison, three traditional geostatistic methods
   were also applied: ordinary kriging (OK), which used the wireless sensor
   network data only, regression kriging (RK) and ordinary co-kriging
   (Co-OK) which both integrated the ASTER land surface temperature as a
   covariate. In Co-OK, LST was linearly contained in the estimator, in RK,
   estimator is expressed as the sum of the regression estimate and the
   kriged estimate of the spatially correlated residual, but in BME, the
   ASTER land surface temperature was first retrieved as soil moisture
   based on the linear regression, then, the t-distributed prediction
   interval (PI) of soil moisture was estimated and used as soft data in
   probability form. The results indicate that all three methods provide
   reasonable estimations. Co-OK, RK and BME can provide a more accurate
   spatial estimation by integrating the auxiliary information Compared to
   OK. RK and BME shows more obvious improvement compared to Co-OK, and
   even BME can perform slightly better than RK. The inherent issue of
   spatial estimation (overestimation in the range of low values and
   underestimation in the range of high values) can also be further
   improved in both RK and BME. We can conclude that integrating auxiliary
   data into spatial estimation can indeed improve the accuracy, BME and RK
   take better advantage of the auxiliary information compared to Co-OK,
   and BME outperforms RK by integrating the auxiliary data in a
   probability form. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Stepwise-Cluster Prediction Model: The Case of Upper Blue Nile Basin,
   Ethiopia},

Abstract = {In this study, a residual soil moisture prediction model was developed
   using the stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) and model prediction approach
   in the Upper Blue Nile basin. The SCA has the advantage of capturing the
   nonlinear relationships between remote sensing variables and volumetric
   soil moisture. The principle of SCA is to generate a set of prediction
   cluster trees based on a series of cutting and merging process according
   to a given statistical criterion. The proposed model incorporates the
   combinations of dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR data, normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), and digital elevation model as input
   parameters. In this regard, two separate stepwise cluster models were
   developed using volumetric soil moisture obtained from automatic weather
   stations (AWS) and Noah model simulation as response variables. The
   performance of the SCA models have been verified for different
   significance levels (i.e., alpha = 0.01, alpha = 0.05, and alpha = 0.1).
   Thus, the AWS based SCA model with alpha = 0.05 was found to be an
   optimal model for predicting volumetric residual soil moisture, with
   correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.95 and 0.87 and root mean square
   error (RMSE) of 0.032 and 0.097 m(3)/m(3) during the training and
   testing periods, respectively. While in the case of the Noah SCA model
   an optimal prediction performance was observed when alpha value was set
   to 0.01, with r being 0.93 and 0.87 and RMSE of 0.043 and 0.058
   m(3)/m(3) using the training and testing datasets, respectively. In
   addition, our result indicated that the combined use of Sentinel-SAR
   data and ancillary remote sensing products such as NDVI could allow for
   better soil moisture prediction. Compared to the support vector
   regression (SVR) method, SCA shows better fitting and prediction
   accuracy of soil moisture. Generally, this study asserts that the SCA
   can be used as an alternative method for remote sensing based soil
   moisture predictions.},

Abstract = {For soil water and solute transport research, time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) has been commonly used since its introduction to soil research in
   1980 by Topp and his colleagues. Although TDR seems to be very versatile
   for laboratory and field experiments, it requires modest user skills for
   accurate measurements and the instrument itself is still expensive. A
   new soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC) sensor was recently
   developed at a reduced cost. The new sensor independently measures soil
   water content, and soil bulk electrical conductivity using frequency
   phase-shift techniques, and soil temperatures using a thermistor. We
   evaluated the new sensor for measurements of water content, and EC using
   three different sensors in variably saturated soils. There was little
   deviation among the units for water content measurement except at near
   saturation. Separate exponential curves provided good calibrations for
   all the soils used in the full range of water content between air-dry
   and saturation. In saline water up to 54 mS m(-1), the mV output in the
   EC measurement mode was linearly related to solution EC. Although slopes
   were quite similar among the three sensors, the intercepts differed from
   the manufacturer's calibration. The calibrations for volumetric water
   content and electrical conductivity provided by the manufacturer were
   not good enough for any use. The temperature effect on volumetric water
   content could be negligible or easily compensated with a simple formula.
   Little EC dependency of the sensor on volumetric water content was
   observed.},

Title = {Mini Inside-Out Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Sensor Design for Soil
   Moisture Measurements},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {The improvement of water management in agriculture by exactly detecting
   moisture parameters of soil is crucial. To investigate this problem, a
   mini inside-out nuclear magnetic resonance sensor (NMR) was proposed to
   measure moisture parameters of model soils. This sensor combines three
   cylindrical magnets that are magnetized in the axial direction and three
   arc spiral coils of the same size in series. We calculated and optimized
   the magnet structure by equivalent magnetization to current density. By
   adjusting the radius and height between the cylinders, a circumferential
   symmetric constant gradient field (2.28 T/m) was obtained. The NMR
   sensor was set at 2.424 MHz to measure the water content of sandy soil
   with small particle diameter and silica sand with large particle
   diameter. The complete decaying, an NMR signal was analyzed through
   inverse Laplace transformation and averaged on a T-2 space. According to
   the results, moisture content of the sample is positively correlated
   with the integral area of T-2 spectrum peak (A(peak)); T-2 of the water
   in small pores is shorter than that in large pores, because the movement
   of water molecules are limited by the inner wall of the pores. In the
   same volume, water in large pore sample is more than that in small pore
   sample, so A(peak) of silica sand is larger than A(peak) of sandy soil.
   Therefore, the sensor is capable of detecting moisture both content and
   pore size of the sample. This mini sensor (4.0 cm in diameter and 10 cm
   in length) is portable, and the lowest measurable humidity is 0.38\%.
   Thus, this sensor will allow easy soil moisture measurements on-field in
   the future.},

Abstract = {Water savings potential of soil moisture sensor irrigation control
   technologies have not been reported in homes irrigating with reclaimed
   water (RW). The main objective of this research was to evaluate the
   performance and water conservation potential of a soil moisture sensor
   system (SMS) in homes that used RW as their source for irrigation, as
   compared to homes with irrigation timers only, or to homes with
   educational materials and/or rain sensors. Secondary objectives were to:
   a) estimate the water depth applied by the different technologies
   compared to a theoretical requirement (calculated using a daily soil
   water balance), and b) estimate the effects of local watering
   restrictions on the amount of RW used by homeowners. In the vicinity of
   Palm Harbor, Florida, a total of 64 homes supplied with reclaimed water
   for irrigation (with an average salinity of 0.7 dS/m) were selected for
   this study. Dedicated irrigation flowmeters were installed in every
   home. The 64 homes were divided in 4 treatments with 16 homes each.
   Treatments were: MO (monitored only), SMS, rain sensor, and rain sensor
   plus educational materials. The SMS treatment was the only group of
   homes significantly different to MO, reducing the average number of
   irrigation events per week (1.7 vs. 2.7 events/week, respectively),
   decreasing the depth of the weekly irrigation (22 vs. 42 mm,
   respectively), and applying 44\% less water, over the 32 months of data
   collection. These results indicate that the tested SMS can save a
   significant amount of RW, compared to the other methods/technologies
   investigated. Even when all treatments over-irrigated most of the time,
   SMS irrigated most properly, compared to a theoretical requirement.
   Finally, under severe dry weather conditions, the local watering
   restrictions promoted a more efficient use of the RW.},

Title = {Precise irrigation scheduling for turfgrass using a subsurface

Volume = {84},
Number = {1-2},

Abstract = {Instrumented weather stations are often used for evapotranspiration (ET)
   determination in order to estimate crop water use for irrigation
   scheduling. A direct estimate of crop water use by subsurface
   measurements of soil water content has been limited by the high cost of
   reliable soil moisture sensors. Recent advances in electromagnetic (EM)
   sensor technology have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality
   using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing. our objectives were: (i)
   to compare irrigation scheduling in turfgrass based on weather station
   ET estimates with those from a novel time domain transmission (TDT) soil
   moisture sensor and (ii) to apply a computer-based numerical model to
   simulate volumetric soil water content (theta) dynamics at the burial
   depth of the sensor and any drainage occurring below the turfgrass
   rooting depth. The TDT sensor was designed to directly connect to a
   custom irrigation controller or to interface a small display/control box
   with a conventional irrigation timer where irrigation scheduling is
   based on a threshold water content (theta(Thresh)). The sensor circuitry
   controlled the irrigation schedule by allowing the preprogrammed
   schedule to operate whenever the sensor-estimated water content
   (theta(Sensor)) dropped below theta(Thresh). The TDT sensor was
   installed under Kentucky bluegrass with a nearby weather station
   providing estimates of ET for comparison over a period of approximately
   7 weeks. The HYDRUS-2D numerical simulation model was used for
   predicting water content (theta(Sim)) in the soil profile. The model
   input requirements include the flow domain geometry and boundary
   conditions, along with estimates of evaporation, transpiration,
   precipitation, irrigation and root water uptake data. Relative to ET
   based irrigation recommendations, the TDT system applied approximately
   16\% less water when irrigating with a sprinkler having a relative
   application depth of 0.80 at the position of the sensor (i.e. fraction
   of the design application rate applied at the sensor). Relative to a
   fixed irrigation rate of 50 mm week(-1), the TDT system applied
   approximately 53\% less water. Modeling results of the TDT sensor
   control indicated that no detectable water drained below the estimated
   30 cm rooting depth of turfgrass when uncontrolled application events
   (e.g. rainfall) were ignored. Performance of the TDT system is dependent
   on the sensor burial depth and theta(Thresh). The theta(Thresh) value is
   soil-type dependent and should be established via consideration of theta
   at field capacity and permanent wilting point. The potential water
   savings with the TDT system is not only important to water conservation,
   but can save irrigators an estimated US\$ 5.00-100.00 per month based on
   average water prices in the US and a 1000 m(2) irrigated turfgrass plot.

Abstract = {A combined horizontal penetrometer was designed for the on-the-go and

Abstract = {CS655 Water Content Reflectometer (WCR) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.,
   Logan, UT, USA) is a recently developed multiparameter electromagnetic
   sensor measuring volumetric soil water content (theta), bulk soil
   electrical conductivity (sigma(b)), and temperature. In this study,
   CS655 sensor's performance was investigated through laboratory
   experiments using a set of liquids with known dielectric and salinity
   properties and soils featuring a wide range of conditions (including
   physico-chemical properties, water regimes and salinity of the water
   solution). The sensor's performance was analyzed in comparison with WET
   and ML2 theta probe (Delta-T Device Ltd, Cambridge, UK) dielectric
   sensors. It was found that CS655 apparent dielectric permittivity
   (epsilon(a)) readings were higher than that of Topp's permittivity-water
   content relationship, especially at higher soil water content values, as
   much as 12 dimensionless permittivity units. The results suggested that
   the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content
   (theta(m)) root epsilon(a) and ea was strongly linear (0.911 < R-2 <
   0.997). The most accurate results were provided by the multi-point
   calibration method. Moreover, for the case of non-conductive soils,
   Kelleners's method provides similar epsilon(a) values with CS655 sensor
   readings for a maximum sigma(b) value of about 0.8 dS m(-1). Concerning
   the use of empirical calibration equations, which include the effect of
   bulk electrical conductivity in epsilon(a), the obtained results suggest
   that the equation theta = a root epsilon(a)+ b + c sigma(b) has a strong
   physical basis and adequate performance (RMSE < 0.03 m(3) m(-3)).
   Finally, the investigation of the epsilon(a)-sigma(b) relationship
   revealed that it is strongly linear and that slope mainly depends on the
   pore water electrical conductivity (sigma(p)), which is closely related
   to the soil solution salinity in contact with plant roots that
   influences plants growth. The Malliki-Walzcak model provide more
   reliable sigma(p) predictions as compared to the Hilhorst model.},

Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},

Abstract = {Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a standard method to estimate soil
   water content and bulk soil electrical conductivity. In many
   applications, several TDR probes are installed in soil columns or field
   setups, and TDR measurements are acquired using a multiplexing system.
   Commercially available multiplexers share a common ground, which might
   lead to inaccurate TDR measurements when probes are installed close
   together or at sites with high electromagnetic noise. Therefore, a new
   eight-channel differential multiplexer (50C81-SDM) was developed that
   allows communication with standard TDR equipment. In a first step, the
   new multiplexer was tested to analyze channel noise and channel to
   channel variability for open reflection coefficients and travel times.
   The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the
   channels for both the open reflection coefficient and travel times.
   Second, the 50C81-SDM multiplexer was tested using TDR probes installed
   in electrolyte solutions and a sand tank. In contrast to multiplexers
   with a common ground, they showed no interference of closely spaced TDR
   probes (spacing ranging from 5 to 95 cm). On the other hand, the SDMX50
   multiplexer showed absolute differences in bulk electrical
   conductivities of >0.001 Sm-1 for high volumetric water contents and
   high bulk electrical conductivities. Measurements at a test site with
   high electromagnetic noise showed the applicability of the 50C81-SDM
   multiplexer in such environments, but only if the entire TDR setup was
   disconnected from the permanent power supply.},

Abstract = {Under rainfed Mediterranean conditions, water economy must be based on a
   suitable choice of agronomic techniques. A 6-yr study was undertaken to
   determine the effects of tillage system, preceding crop, and N
   fertilizer on soil water at wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) planting and
   harvest in a Vertisol. Tillage treatments were no-tillage and
   conventional tillage. Preceding crops, in 2-yr rotations, were sunflower
   (Helianthus annuus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia
   faba L.), fallow, and continuous wheat. Nitrogen fertilizer rates were
   0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1) applied to wheat only. No-tillage did
   not provide more water at wheat planting for any of the rotations.
   Preceding crop effect on soil water content (SWC) at planting was as
   follows: fallow >= faba bean > wheat >= chickpea > sunflower. At
   harvest, SWC was higher in continuous wheat. Only at harvest were there
   differences among N fertilizer rates for SWC. Besides, measurement of
   SWC at harvest for sunflower, chickpea, faba bean, and fallow were
   performed to determine soil water storage and precipitation storage
   efficiency (PSE) for 2 yr. Soil water storage was higher for rotations
   with sunflower or fallow. Nevertheless, fallow PSE was the lowest
   (10\%). The mean PSE was 29\%. Under the conditions of this study,
   no-tillage is not more efficient than conventional tillage in soil water
   accumulation. Fallow is not a useful tool for increasing water
   availability.},

Abstract = {The Hydra Probe (HP) measures soil volumetric water content (theta(v))
   with an electrical impedance sensor that operates at a frequency of 50
   MHz. The main objective of this research was to investigate the mixed
   effects of texture, disturbance, and salinity on the estimation of
   theta(v) by the HP Duplicate disturbed and undisturbed samples from
   three sites with different soil textures (clay, silty clay loam, and
   sandy loam) were saturated with distilled-deionized water and four
   saline solutions (corresponding electrical conductivities of 0, 1.23,
   2.02, 2.41, and 3.96 dS m(-1)) for three days and then air-dried under
   laboratory conditions, generating monotonic drying curves. The real
   (epsilon(r)) and imaginary (epsilon(i)) components of the dielectric
   permittivity were measured every 5 min by the HP and recorded with a
   datalogger. Load cells simultaneously recorded changing sample weight
   over time to provide an independent measure of theta(v). Our results
   indicate that for the range of conductivities in our samples, there is
   no benefit to predicting theta(v) from epsilon(r) by also including
   epsilon(i), or a correction for the loss tangent (i.e., tan delta =
   epsilon(i)/epsilon(r)). Regression analysis combined with analysis of
   variance showed that both soil texture and disturbance significantly
   influenced the estimation of theta(v) from epsilon(n) (p < 0.05), while
   salinity or any of the interactions did not significantly influence its
   estimation. As quantified by the mean absolute error (MAE), the overall
   accuracy of the HP in this study was 0.0177 cm(3) cm(-3). Accounting for
   both soil texture and disturbance reduced the average MAE by 8.45\%.
   Based on these analyses, we recommend that soil texture and disturbance
   effects be included in the development of future calibration equations
   for the HP},

Abstract = {Electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements are widely used for soil
   mapping, as they allow fast and relatively low-cost surveys of soil
   apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). Although the use of non-invasive
   EMI for imaging spatial soil properties is very attractive, the
   dependence of ECa on several factors challenges any interpretation with
   respect to individual soil properties or states such as soil moisture
   (theta). The major aim of this study was to further investigate the
   potential of repeated EMI measurements to map theta, with particular
   focus on the temporal variability of the spatial patterns of ECa and
   theta. To this end, we compared repeated EMI measurements with
   high-resolution theta data from a wireless soil moisture and soil
   temperature monitoring network for an extensively managed hillslope area
   for which soil properties and theta dynamics are known. For the
   investigated site, (i) ECa showed small temporal variations whereas
   theta varied from very dry to almost saturation, (ii) temporal changes
   of the spatial pattern of ECa differed from those of the spatial pattern
   of theta, and (iii) the ECa-theta relationship varied with time. Results
   suggest that (i) depending upon site characteristics, stable soil
   properties can be the major control of ECa measured with EMI, and (ii)
   for soils with low clay content, the influence of theta on ECa may be
   confounded by changes of the electrical conductivity of the soil
   solution. Further, this study discusses the complex interplay between
   factors controlling ECa and theta, and the use of EMI-based ECa data
   with respect to hydrological applications.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture data obtained by inversion of Fengyun 3B remote sensing
   data, are widely used in drought monitoring and global climate change
   research, however, some regional data are missing in this data set,
   which reduces the application effect. Based on backpropagation neural
   network (BPNN), we established a filling method and filled the missing
   area with moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
   inversion products, including land surface temperature, normalized
   difference vegetation index, and albedo. We named it the multilayer BPNN
   filling algorithm. The algorithm consists of two neural network layers.
   The first network layer is used for the spatial scaling of MODIS
   inversion products, and the second network layer uses the scaling
   products to further generate soil moisture values. We compared the
   proposed method to a discrete cosine transform and partial least square
   (DCT-PLS) and a kriging using the same data set. The experiments
   demonstrate that our method could obtain good filling results in both
   homogeneous areas and areas with high data variations, whereas DCT-PLS
   and kriging could only get good filling results in homogeneous areas.

Abstract = {An effective temperature correction method for dielectric sensors is
   important to ensure the accuracy of soil water content (SWC)
   measurements of local to regional-scale soil moisture monitoring
   networks. These networks are extensively using highly temperature
   sensitive dielectric sensors due to their low cost, ease of use and less
   power consumption. Yet there is no general temperature correction method
   for dielectric sensors, instead sensor or site dependent correction
   algorithms are employed. Such methods become ineffective at soil
   moisture monitoring networks with different sensor setups and those that
   cover diverse climatic conditions and soil types. This study attempted
   to develop a general temperature correction method for dielectric
   sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in
   sensor type, climatic conditions and soil type without rainfall data. In
   this work an automated general temperature correction method was
   developed by adopting previously developed temperature correction
   algorithms using time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements to
   ThetaProbe ML2X, Stevens Hydra probe II and Decagon Devices EC-TM sensor
   measurements. The rainy day effects removal procedure from SWC data was
   automated by incorporating a statistical inference technique with
   temperature correction algorithms. The temperature correction method was
   evaluated using 34 stations from the International Soil Moisture
   Monitoring Network and another nine stations from a local soil moisture
   monitoring network in Mongolia. Soil moisture monitoring networks used
   in this study cover four major climates and six major soil types.
   Results indicated that the automated temperature correction algorithms
   developed in this study can eliminate temperature effects from
   dielectric sensor measurements successfully even without on-site
   rainfall data. Furthermore, it has been found that actual daily average
   of SWC has been changed due to temperature effects of dielectric sensors
   with a significant error factor comparable to 1\% manufacturer's
   accuracy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) mission, launched in January 2015, was designed to
   provide a global soil moisture product at medium resolution (similar to
   9 km), by combining observations from its radar and radiometer. Several
   downscaling methods have been proposed by the SMAP team for this
   purpose. This paper evaluates another candidate downscaling method,
   namely, the Bayesian merging approach. While this has been tested using
   a synthetic data set across the USA, it is imperative that it can also
   be tested using the experimental data for a comprehensive range of land
   surface conditions (i.e., in different hydro-climatic regions) prior to
   a global application. Consequently, this paper applies this method using
   the data collected from SMAP experiments field campaigns in southeastern
   Australia that closely simulated the SMAP data stream for a single SMAP
   radiometer pixel over a three-week interval. The method studied here
   differs from the linear downscaling methods of the SMAP mission, in that
   it uses a nonlinear method based on Bayes' theorem. The
   medium-resolution soil moisture product is obtained using background
   soil moisture estimates that are updated according to the difference
   between the observed and predicted brightness temperatures and
   backscatter coefficients, relating the high- and low-resolution data.
   Results were assessed against a reference soil moisture map derived from
   high-resolution airborne radiometer observations. The
   root-mean-square-error and R-2 for the Bayesian merging method were
   found to be 0.02 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.55, respectively, at 9-km resolution,
   being similar to the SMAP's ``optional{''} downscaling method.},

Abstract = {Rainfall and soil moisture, SM, are two important quantities for
   modeling the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere.
   Usually, rainfall observations are used as input data for modeling the
   time evolution of SM within hydrological and land surface models. In
   this study, by inverting the soil-water balance equation, a simple
   analytical relationship for estimating rainfall accumulations from the
   knowledge of SM time series is obtained. In situ and satellite SM
   observations from three different sites in Italy, Spain, and France are
   used to test the reliability of the proposed approach in contrasting
   climatic conditions. The results show that the model is able to
   satisfactorily reproduce daily rainfall data when in situ SM
   observations are employed (correlation coefficient, R, nearly equal to
   0.9). Furthermore, also by using satellite data reasonable results are
   obtained in reproducing 4 day rainfall accumulations with R-values close
   to 0.8. Based on these preliminary results, the proposed approach can be
   adopted conveniently to improve rainfall estimation at a catchment scale
   and as a supplementary source of data to estimate rainfall at a global
   scale. Citation: Brocca, L., T. Moramarco, F. Melone, and W. Wagner

Abstract = {Agricultural drought is characterized by low soil moisture levels that
   negatively affect agricultural production, but in situ soil moisture
   measurements are largely absent from indices commonly used to describe
   agricultural drought. Instead, many indices incorporate weather-derived
   soil moisture estimates, which is necessary, in part, because the
   relationships between in situ soil moisture and agricultural-drought
   impacts are not well quantified. Our objective was to use in situ soil
   moisture data from monitoring networks in Oklahoma and West Texas to
   identify a soil moisture-based agricultural drought index that is (i)
   strongly related to crop-yield anomaly across networks, (ii) comparable
   across time and space, and (iii) readily understandable. Candidate
   indices included soil matric potential (MP), soil water storage (SWS),
   and fraction of available water capacity (FAW), with indices assessed in
   their raw form and after climatological (i.e., anomalies) or statistical
   standardization. At the county level, indices related similarly to
   crop-yield anomaly, with soil moisture-yield anomaly correlation
   coefficients averaging 0.63, 0.76, and 0.76 for winter wheat, hay, and
   cotton, respectively. However, standardization was essential to maximize
   temporal and spatial comparability, and at the regional level,
   standardized indices were more highly correlated with crop-yield anomaly
   than non-standardized indices. Our findings show that existing in situ
   soil moisture datasets can underpin regional drought-monitoring systems.
   The SWS-anomaly may be the preferred index because it is comparable
   across space and time, has units that are readily understandable (e.g.,
   mm or inches), and can be broadly applied using data from the many in
   situ soil-moisture monitoring networks across the world.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is the key link among hydroecological compartments,
   responding dynamically to sequences of atmospheric processes and
   management conditions and modulating physical, chemical, and biological
   processes in the soil. Currently, there are a variety of monitoring
   techniques to measure, directly or indirectly, the soil moisture.
   However, some practical issues remain open like the definition a priori
   of the number, location and depth of the monitoring points, and the
   impact of failing or poor performance soil moisture sensors. Here, we
   present a set of techniques, namely Delta theta time series, wavelet
   filtering, and time stability, to identify representative points and
   monitoring depths through an analysis of hourly soil moisture time
   series for different configuration of the monitoring network. We used
   real data from a monitoring network consisting of seven monitoring
   points, each one with four EC-5 probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman,
   WA) at 20, 40, 60, and 100 cm. The use of simple time series of Delta
   theta allowed us to assess the spatiotemporal influence of the
   monitoring points, while the wavelet periodograms allowed us to get
   insight about the response of the monitoring points at different time
   scales. Both methods are easy to implement or adapt to specific
   conditions, being coherent to the results derived from time stability
   analysis. For our case study, we concluded that we could reallocate 16
   sensors (out of 28) without a significant loss of information. However,
   the final decision strongly relies on a deep knowledge of the site
   features and the objectives of the monitoring network.},

Abstract = {This paper develops two alternative approaches for downscaling passive

   the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed during the Monsoon'90 experiment
   were used to test these approaches. These data consisted of eight
   micrometeorological stations (METFLUX) and six flights of the L-band
   Push Broom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR). For each PBMR flight, the 180-m
   resolution L-band pixels covering the eight METFLUX sites were first
   aggregated to generate a 500-m ``coarse-scale{''} passive microwave
   pixel. The coarse-scale-derived soil moisture was then downscaled to the
   180-m resolution using two different surface soil moisture indexes
   (SMIs): 1) the evaporative fraction (EF), which is the ratio of the
   evapotranspiration to the total energy available at the surface; and 2)
   the actual EF (AEF), which is defined as the ratio of the
   actual-to-potential evapotranspiration. It is well known that both SMIs
   depend on the surface soil moisture. However, they are also influenced
   by other factors such as vegetation cover, soil type, root-zone soil
   moisture, and atmospheric conditions. In order to decouple the influence
   of soil moisture from the other factors, a land surface model was used
   to account for the heterogeneity of vegetation cover, soil type, and
   atmospheric conditions. The overall accuracy in the downscaled values
   was evaluated to 3\% (vol.) for EF and 2\% (vol.) for AEF under
   cloud-free conditions. These results illustrate the potential use of
   satellite-based estimates of instantaneous evapotranspiration on
   clear-sky days for downscaling the coarse-resolution passive microwave
   soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Microwave radiometer measurements of the Planck emission from soil can
   be used to estimate the near-surface soil moisture. A more
   straightforward and consistent model of this emission results if
   nonuniform, rather than uniform, plane waves are used. Adaptation of
   this new model to a layered medium representation for the soil is
   improved using a normalization that is based on the isothermal soil
   limit. The separate concepts of radiometer sensing depth and in situ
   sampling depth for soil moisture are examined and theory for the sensing
   depth is presented. Improved approximations (at 1413 MHz) to the full
   model for soil emission are developed since they are needed to construct
   algorithms that retrieve an estimate of soil moisture from the
   radiometer raw measurement. The error associated with the comparison of
   these remotely sense values against in situ measurements is calculated.
   Results suggest that this comparison error could be lowered if the soil
   moisture sampling depth was reduced to values less than 0.01 m from the
   currently used values near 0.02 m, although the effect of surface
   roughness has not yet been analyzed.},

Abstract = {The heat pulse probe method can be implemented with actively heated
   fiber optics (AHFO) to obtain distributed measurements of soil water
   content (u) by using reported soil thermal responses measured by
   Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and with a soil-specific

   efficient in situ calibration procedures useful in heterogeneous soils
   are lacking. Here we employed the Hydrus 2-D/3-D code to define a
   soil-specific calibration curve. We define a 2-D geometry of the fiber
   optic cable and the surrounding soil media, and simulate heat pulses to
   capture the soil thermal response at different soil water contents. The
   model was validated in an irrigated field using DTS data from two
   locations along the FO deployment in which reference moisture sensors
   were installed. Results indicate that u was measured with the

Abstract = {A multi-scale soil moisture monitoring strategy for California was
   designed to inform water resource management. The proposed workflow
   classifies soil moisture response units (SMRUs) using publicly available
   datasets that represent soil, vegetation, climate, and hydrology

   using principal component analysis and unsupervised K-means clustering
   within a geographic information system, and validated, using summary
   statistics derived from measured soil moisture time series. Validation
   stations, located in the Sierra Nevada, include transect of sites that
   cross the rain-to-snow transition and a cluster of sites located at
   similar elevations in a snow-dominated watershed. The SMRUs capture
   unique responses to varying climate conditions characterized by
   statistical measures of central tendency, dispersion, and extremes. A
   topographic position index and landform classification is the final step
   in the workflow to guide the optimal placement of soil moisture sensors
   at the local-scale. The proposed workflow is highly flexible and can be
   implemented over a range of spatial scales and input datasets can be
   customized. Our approach captures a range of soil moisture responses to
   climate across California and can be used to design and optimize soil
   moisture monitoring strategies to support runoff forecasts for water

Title = {Influence of land use on soil moisture spatial-temporal variability and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},

Volume = {516},
Number = {SI},
Pages = {193-199},
Month = {AUG 4},
Abstract = {In this study, the influence of land use on soil moisture dynamics is
   investigated for monitoring purposes. To this end, 23 measurement
   campaigns were carried out during a period of 8 months at 5 sites
   located in central Italy, within a catchment of similar to 6 km(2). The
   sites are characterized by different land uses: grassland, woodland
   (holm oak and hornbeam) olive grove and cropland. Soil moisture was
   measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of
   15 cm under the soil surface. The optimization of the monitoring scheme
   was addressed through a statistical and temporal stability analysis.
   Notwithstanding the significant differences in the land use, the
   temporal patterns of the field-mean soil moisture of the different sites
   were very similar while the spatial variability, expressed through the
   coefficient of variation, was found slightly higher (average value equal
   to 0.27) than that obtained from previous sampling campaigns on the same
   area but on sites characterized by a homogeneous soil use. The maximum
   number of required samples, to estimate the areal mean soil moisture
   within an accuracy of 2\% vol/vol, was found ranging between 7 and 11 at
   the field scale and equal to 20 at the catchment scale. The temporal
   stability analysis allowed to identify the grassland site as the most
   representative of the catchment-mean soil moisture behavior (coefficient
   of determination, R-2 = 0.96). Therefore, even though the heterogeneity
   of the land use increases the spatial variability (as expected), soil
   moisture exhibits a significant temporal stability and its large scale
   monitoring from few observations is still feasible. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {A Neural Network (NN) algorithm was developed to estimate global surface
   soil moisture for April 2015 to March 2017 with a 2-3 day repeat
   frequency using passive microwave observations from the Soil Moisture
   Active Passive (SMAP) satellite, surface soil temperatures from the NASA
   Goddard Earth Observing System Model version 5 (GEOS-5) land modeling
   system, and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer-based
   vegetation water content. The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture
   target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5
   climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this
   model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil
   moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error
   (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were
   0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core
   validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48,
   respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN)
   measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a
   significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a
   slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P)
   product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower
   ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when
   ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain.
   Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was
   more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer
   (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval
   errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors
   are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.},

   forests},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {20},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1269-1288},
Abstract = {Measuring soil moisture with cosmic-ray neutrons is a promising
   technique for intermediate spatial scales. To convert neutron counts to
   average volumetric soil water content a simple calibration function can
   be used (the N-0-calibration of Desilets et al., 2010). The calibration
   is based on soil water content derived directly from soil samples taken
   within the footprint of the sensor. We installed a cosmic-ray neutron
   sensor (CRS) in a mixed forest in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany
   and calibrated it 10 times throughout one calendar year. Each
   calibration with the N-0-calibration function resulted in a different
   CRS soil moisture time series, with deviations of up to 0.1 m(3) m(-3)
   (24\% of the total range) for individual values of soil water content.
   Also, many of the calibration efforts resulted in time series that could
   not be matched with independent in situ measurements of soil water
   content. We therefore suggest a modified calibration function with a
   different shape that can vary from one location to another. A two-point
   calibration was found to effectively define the shape of the modified
   calibration function if the calibration points were taken during both
   dry and wet conditions spanning at least half of the total range of soil
   moisture. The best results were obtained when the soil samples used for
   calibration were linearly weighted as a function of depth in the soil
   profile and nonlinearly weighted as a function of distance from the CRS,
   and when the depth-specific amount of soil organic matter and lattice
   water content was explicitly considered. The annual cycle of tree
   foliation was found to be a negligible factor for calibration because
   the variable hydrogen mass in the leaves was small compared to the
   hydrogen mass changes by soil moisture variations. As a final point, we
   provide a calibration guide for a CRS in forested environments.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising proximal soil sensing
   technique to estimate soil moisture at intermediate scale and high
   temporal resolution. However, the signal shows complex and non-unique
   response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface, providing some
   challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications. Aims
   of the study were 1) to assess the uncertainty of CRNS as a stand-alone
   approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2) to
   identify the causes of this uncertainty 3) and possible improvements.
   Two experimental sites in Germany were equipped with a CRNS probe and
   point-scale soil moisture network. Additional monitoring activities were
   conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil-plant
   systems. This data is used to identify and quantify the different
   sources of uncertainty (factors). An uncertainty analysis, based on
   Monte Carlo approach, is applied to propagate these uncertainties to
   CRNS soil moisture estimations. In addition, a sensitivity analysis
   based on the Sobol' method is performed to identify the most important
   factors explaining this uncertainty. Results show that CRNS soil
   moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these
   point-scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity
   of the signal and other sources of hydrogen (lattice water and organic
   carbon) are added to the water content. However, the performance
   decreases when CRNS is considered as a stand-alone method to retrieve
   the actual (non-weighted) volumetric soil moisture. The support volume
   (penetration depth and radius) shows also a considerable uncertainty,
   especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions. Four of the seven
   factors analyzed (the vertical soil moisture profile, bulk density,
   incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter N o ) were
   found to play an important role. Among the possible improvements
   identified, a simple correction factor based on vertical point-scale
   soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for
   the sensitivity of the CRNS signal to the upper soil layers.},

Title = {Optimizing the Positioning of Soil Moisture Monitoring Sensors in Winter
   Wheat Fields},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Collecting accurate real-time soil moisture data in crop root zones is
   the foundation of automated precision irrigation systems. Soil moisture
   sensors (SMSs) have been used to monitor soil water content (SWC) in
   crop fields for a long time; however, there is no generally accepted
   guideline for determining optimal number and placement of soil moisture
   sensors in the soil profile. In order to study adequate positioning for
   the installation of soil moisture sensors in the soil profile, six years
   of field experiments were carried out in North China Plain (NCP). Soil
   water content was measured using the gravimetric method every 7 to 10
   days during six growing seasons of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L),
   and root distribution was measured using a soil core method during the
   key periods of winter wheat growth. The results from the experimental
   data analysis show that SWC at different depths had a high linear
   correlation. In addition, the values of correlation coefficients
   decreased with increasing soil depth; the coefficient of variation (CV)
   of SWC was higher in the surface layers than in the deeper layers
   (depths were 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm during the early, middle,
   and last stages of winter wheat, respectively); wheat roots were mainly
   distributed in the surface layer. According to an analysis of CV for SWC
   and root distribution, the depths of planned wetted layers were
   determined to be 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm during the sowing to
   reviving stages (the early stage of winter wheat), returning green and
   jointing stages (the middle stage of winter wheat), and heading to
   maturity stage (the last stage of winter wheat), respectively. The
   correlation and R-cluster analyses of SWC at different layers in the
   soil profile showed that SMSs should be installed 10 and 30 cm below the
   soil surface during the winter wheat growing season. The linear
   regression model can be built using SWC at depths of 10 and 30 cm to
   predict total average SWC in the soil profile. The results of validation
   showed that the developed model provided reliable estimates of total
   average SWC in the planned wetted layer. In brief, this study suggests
   that suitable positioning of soil moisture sensors is at depths of 10
   and 30 cm below the soil surface.},

   redistribution, many of the existing methods to capture spatial patterns
   are time consuming, expensive or need site-specific calibration. In this
   study we present a quick and inexpensive supplementary field method for
   classifying soil wetness in wet environments. The seven wetness classes
   are based on qualitative indicators, which one can touch, hear or see on
   the soil surface. To counter critics that such qualitative methods are
   considerably affected by subjectivity, we performed systematic testing
   of the method by taking qualitative measurements in the field with 20
   non-expert raters. We then analyzed these in terms of degree of
   agreement and assessed the results against gravimetric sampling and time
   domain reflectometry measurements. In 70\% of all classifications raters
   agreed on the wetness class assigned to the marked sampling locations
   and in 95\% they were not off by more than one wetness class. The seven
   quantitative wetness classes agreed with gravimetric and time domain
   reflectometry measurements, although intermediate to wet classes showed
   an overlap of their range whereas the driest classes showed considerable
   spread. Despite some potential to optimize the method, it has been shown
   to be a reliable supplement to existing quantitative techniques for
   assessing soil moisture patterns in wet environments. Copyright (c) 2012

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in land-atmosphere interactions.
   It is an important geophysical parameter in research on climate,
   hydrology, agriculture, and forestry. Soil moisture has important
   climatic effects by influencing ground evapotranspiration, runoff,
   surface reflectivity, surface emissivity, surface sensible heat and
   latent heat flux. At the global scale, the extent of its influence on
   the atmosphere is second only to that of sea surface temperature. At the
   terrestrial scale, its influence is even greater than that of sea
   surface temperatures. This paper presents a China Land Soil Moisture
   Data Assimilation System (CLSMDAS) based on EnKF and land process
   models, and results of the application of this system in the China Land
   Soil Moisture Data Assimilation tests. CLSMDAS is comprised of the
   following components: 1) A land process model-Community Land Model
   Version 3.0 (CLM3.0)-developed by the US National Center for Atmospheric
   Research (NCAR); 2) Precipitation of atmospheric forcing data and
   surface-incident solar radiation data come from hourly outputs of the
   FY2 geostationary meteorological satellite; 3) EnKF (Ensemble Kalman
   Filter) land data assimilation method; and 4) Observation data including
   satellite-inverted soil moisture outputs of the AMSR-E satellite and
   soil moisture observation data. Results of soil moisture assimilation
   tests from June to September 2006 were analyzed with CLSMDAS. Both
   simulation and assimilation results of the land model reflected
   reasonably the temporal-spatial distribution of soil moisture. The
   assimilated soil moisture distribution matches very well with severe
   summer droughts in Chongqing and Sichuan Province in August 2006, the
   worst since the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It
   also matches drought regions that occurred in eastern Hubei and southern
   Guangxi in September.},

Title = {Land-surface controls on near-surface soil moisture dynamics: Traversing
   remote sensing footprints},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {52},
Number = {8},

Abstract = {In this new era of remote-sensing based hydrology, a major unanswered
   question is how to incorporate the impact of land-surface based
   heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics at remote sensing scales. The
   answer to this question is complicated since (1) soil moisture dynamics
   that vary with support, extent, and spacing scales are dependent on
   land-surface based heterogeneity and (2) land-surface based
   heterogeneity itself is scale-specific and varies with hydroclimates.
   Land-surface factors such as soil, vegetation, and topography affect
   soil moisture dynamics by redistributing the available soil moisture on
   the ground. In this study, we determined the contribution of these
   biophysical factors to redistribution of near-surface soil moisture
   across a range of remote sensing scales varying from an (airborne)
   remote sensor footprint (1.6 km) to a (satellite) footprint scale (25.6
   km). Two-dimensional nondecimated wavelet transform was used to extract
   the support scale information from the spatial signals of the
   land-surface and soil moisture variables. The study was conducted in
   three hydroclimates: humid (Iowa), subhumid (Oklahoma), and semiarid
   (Arizona). The dominance of soil on soil moisture dynamics typically
   decreased from airborne to satellite footprint scales whereas the
   influence of topography and vegetation increased with increasing support
   scale for all three hydroclimates. The distinct effect of hydroclimate
   was identifiable in the soil attributes dominating the soil moisture
   dynamics. The near-surface soil moisture dynamics in Arizona (semiarid)
   can be attributed more to the clay content which is an effective
   limiting parameter for evaporation whereas in Oklahoma (humid), sand
   content (limiting parameter for drainage) was the dominant soil
   attribute. The findings from this study can provide a deeper
   understanding of the impact of heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics
   and the potential improvement of hydrological models operating at
   footprints' scales.},

Title = {Non-invasive soil moisture sensing based on open-ended waveguide and

Abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multivariate analysis
   to increase the performance and reliability of a novel method for a
   non-invasive sensing approach for measuring gravimetric soil moisture.
   Unlike time and frequency domain spectrometers, as well as impedance
   sensors, where probes should be inserted into the terrain, the proposed
   approach simply uses a waveguide faced to the soil surface. An
   open-ended waveguide spectrometer system was developed to acquire
   ``gain{''} and ``phase{''} spectra, related to received and transmitted
   signals, in the 1.5-2.7 GHz range from river sand, lightweight expanded
   clay aggregate (LECA) and silty clay loam soil samples. For each soil
   type, predictive models of the moisture (\%) were obtained and discussed
   by using multivariate tools (Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least
   Square Regression and N-dimensional Partial Least Square Regression).
   The potentiality of the measurement technique was explored for both
   non-layered (homogeneous moisture) and layered (two layers with
   different, homogeneous moisture) soils. In validation tests, R2 values
   up to 0.989 (RMSE=0.8\%, river sand gain) were observed for single layer
   test. For double layer test, R2 values up to 0.977 (RMSE=1.4\%, LECA
   gain, top layer) and 0.962 (RMSE=1.9\%, LECA gain, bottom layer) were
   obtained. A better accuracy was achieved with N-PLS combining ``gain{''}
   and ``phase{''} spectra: R-2 values increase up to 0.991 (RMSE=0.9\%,
   LECA samples). The measurement results demonstrate that the noninvasive
   waveguide-based spectrometry together with the multivariate analysis is
   able to assess different moisture contents, with a high level of
   accuracy, both for non-layered and layered samples of soil with
   homogenous moisture. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to combine remote-sensing and
   artificial intelligence (AI) approaches to estimate surface soil
   moisture (SM) at 100 m spatial and daily temporal resolution. The two
   main variables used in the Triangle method, that is, land-surface
   temperature (LST) and vegetation cover, were downscaled and calculated
   at 100 m spatial resolution. LSTs were downscaled applying the
   Wavelet-Artificial Intelligence Fusion Approach (WAIFA) on Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imageries.
   Vegetation fractions were also estimated at 100 m spatial resolution
   using linear spectral unmixing and Wavelet-AI models. Vegetation indices
   (VIs) were replaced with the vegetation fractions obtained from
   sub-pixel classification in the T-s-VI triangle space. The downscaled
   data were then used for calculating the evaporative fraction (EF),
   temperature-vegetation-dryness index (TVDI), vegetation temperature
   condition index (VTCI), and temperature-vegetation index (TVX) at 100 m
   spatial resolution. Thereafter, surface SM modelling was performed using
   a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy
   Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR)
   modelling approaches. Results showed that the best input data set to
   estimate SM includes EF, TVDI, T-s, F-vegetation, F-soil, temperature
   (T), precipitation at time t(P-t, Pt-1, Pt-2), and irrigation (I). It
   was also confirmed that PSO-SVR outperformed the PSO-ANFIS modelling
   approach and could estimate SM with a coefficient of determination (R-2)
   of 0.93 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.29 at 100 spatial
   resolution. Range of error was limited between-2.64\% and 2.8\%. It was
   also shown that the method proposed by Tang et al., (2010) improved the
   final SM estimations.},

Title = {Evaluation of Calibration Method for Field Application of UAV-Based Soil
   Water Content Prediction Equation},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {2019},
Abstract = {The objective of this study is to monitor the water content of soil
   quickly and accurately using a UAV. Because UAVs have higher spatial and
   temporal resolution than satellites, they are currently becoming more
   useful in remote sensing areas. We developed a water content estimation
   equation using the color of the soil and suggested a calibration method
   for field application. Since the resolution of the images taken by the
   UAV is different according to the altitude, the water content estimation
   formula is developed by using the images taken at each altitude. In
   order to calibrate the color difference according to lighting
   conditions, the calibration method using field data were proposed. The
   results of the study showed an altitude-specific estimation equation
   using RGB values of the UAV image through linear regression. The
   appropriate number of field data needed for calibration for site
   application of the estimation equation was found between 4 and 10.
   On-site application results of the proposed calibration method showed
   RMSE accuracy of 1.8 to 2.9\%. Thus, the water content estimation and
   calibration method proposed in this study can be used in effectively
   monitoring the water content of soil using UAVs.},

Abstract = {In the Gurbantunggut Desert, snowmelt-induced high soil water contents
   briefly create favorable conditions for the germination and growth of
   plants every spring. Monitoring the rapidly changing conditions in this
   time period demands fast and efficient methods for measuring soil water
   contents at the field scale. For this study, a series of
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements were carried out on sites
   characterized by semi-vegetated dunes both in April 2010 and 2011. We
   compare water contents calculated from the GPR direct ground wave signal
   to both point scale validation measurements by time-domain reflectometry
   (TDR) and gravimetric sampling. Our results show that GPR is an
   effective method to rapidly obtain a detailed image of the field scale
   soil water content distribution in the Gurbantunggut Desert with an
   accuracy similar to TDR. Observed large scale soil water content
   variations are dominated by dune topography: During snow melting, melt
   water was found to trickle slowly from the dune ridges to interdune
   valleys, increasing the soil water content there while the dune ridges
   quickly started to dry down. In dune valleys, smaller scale near-surface
   soil water content changes were dominated by variations in the
   vegetation coverage, leading to snowmelt funnels at distinct locations:
   The snowmelt initially occurred around the stems and branches of plants,
   forming funnel-shaped melt water induced holes through the snow cover
   and leading to an increasing amount of melt water collected around these
   plant roots. Our comparison of data from 2010 to 2011 furthermore
   suggests a temporally stable distribution of near-surface soil water
   content. This has important ecological significance for controlling
   desertification and for restoring and reconstructing vegetation in the
   Gurbantunggut Desert.},

Volume = {42},
Number = {2},
Pages = {117-124},
Abstract = {The Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12)
   conducted in Manitoba, Canada, over a 6-week period in 2012 provided
   high-quality data for soil moisture and vegetation, captured over a wide
   range of conditions coincident with airborne active and passive
   microwave acquisitions. In this study, the dataset measured in SMAPVEX12
   was used as the input data of the backpropagation (BP) neural network to
   analyze the potential of different data sources or combination of data
   sources in the research of soil moisture inversion. By the analysis and
   comparison of the results, some valuable conclusions have been obtained:
   (1) passive microwave data has a stronger and more direct connection
   with the near-surface soil moisture (top 0 similar to 6 cm) than the
   active microwave sensing (radar backscatter coefficient) does, because
   the active microwave is more sensitive to the confounding effects of
   vegetation and surface roughness. (2) For the active microwave data,
   some combination form of the horizontal transmit and horizontal receive
   (HH) and vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) is a more
   rational selection than only HH to serve as one of the independent
   information sources for extracting the soil moisture. (3) The optical
   vegetation information provides the rich vegetation information that is
   indispensable for the microwave remote sensing data, especially for
   passive remote sensing, to extract the soil moisture with the average
   correlation coefficient increased by more than 0.05, at least, when
   adding the optical vegetation data. (4) Two kinds of forms of the
   optical vegetation information, either Vegetation Water Content (VWC) or
   Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), show no obvious differences to
   provide as auxiliary information for microwave remote sensing data in
   extracting soil moisture.},

Abstract = {Since the near-infrared (NIR) spectrum is susceptible to sample

   as the pre-processing method and the least squares support vector
   machine (LS-SVM) regression as the modeling method, a model at 20
   degrees C to predict MC of the soil samples at other temperatures was

   predicted results with the dual-factor analysis of variance without

Abstract = {The COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS) rover may be
   useful for validating satellite-based estimates of near-surface soil
   moisture, but the accuracy with which the rover can measure 0- to 5-cm
   soil moisture has not been previously determined. Our objectives were to
   calibrate and validate a COSMOS rover for mapping 0- to 5-cm soil
   moisture at spatial scales suitable for evaluating satellite-based soil
   moisture estimates. Region-specific calibrations for the COSMOS rover
   were developed using field-average soil moisture measured using
   impedance probes and the oven-drying method on volumetric samples. The
   resulting calibrations were applied to map soil moisture on two dates in
   a 16- by 10-km region around the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor
   Testbed (MOISST) in north central Oklahoma and one date in a 34- by
   14-km region in the Little Washita River watershed in southwestern
   Oklahoma. The mapped soil moisture patterns were consistent with the
   regional spatial variability in surface soil texture and with soil
   wetting by an intervening rainfall. The rover measured field-average
   soil moisture with a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.03 cm(3)
   cm(-3) relative to impedance probes. Likewise, the regional-average 0-
   to 5-cm soil moisture determined by the rover was within +/- 0.03 cm(3)
   cm(-3) of the best available independent estimates for each region.
   These results demonstrate that a COSMOS rover can be used effectively
   for 0- to 5-cm soil moisture mapping and for determining the average
   soil moisture at spatial scales suitable for satellite calibration and
   validation.},

Title = {Surface Soil Water Content Estimation from Thermal Remote Sensing based

Abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) is a crucial variable in the thermal infrared
   research and is the major control for land surface hydrological
   processes at the watershed scale. Estimating the surface SWC from
   remotely sensed data using the triangle method proposed by Price has
   been demonstrated in previous studies. In this study, a new soil
   moisture index (Temperature Rising Rate Vegetation Dryness IndexTRRVDI)
   is proposed based on a triangle constructed using the mid-morning land
   surface temperature (LST) rising rate and the vegetation index to
   estimate the regional SWC. The temperature at the dry edge of the
   triangle is determined by the surface energy balance principle. The
   temperature at the wet edge is assumed to be equal to the air
   temperature. The mid-morning land surface temperature rising rate is
   calculated using Meteosat Second GenerationSpinning Enhanced Visible and
   Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) LST products over 4 cloud-free days (day of
   year: 206, 211, 212, 242) in 2007. The developed TRRVDI is validated by
   in situ measurements from 19 meteorological stations in Spain. The
   results indicate that the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the
   TRRVDI derived using the theoretical limiting edges and the in situ SWC
   measurements is greater than that derived using the observed limiting
   edges. The R-2 values are 0.46 and 0.32; respectively (p < 0.05).
   Additionally, the TRRVDI is much better than the soil moisture index
   that was developed using one-time LST and fractional vegetation cover
   (FVC) with the theoretically determined limiting edges.},

Abstract = {Differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) has
   traditionally been used for the detection and accurate monitoring of
   surface movement in a scene and has found applications in fields such as
   mining subsidence and earthquake deformation. In these studies, the
   phase is understood to directly relate to the radial component of the
   physical deformation of the surface. In this paper, however, we use a
   novel combination of microwave and optical laboratory measurements to
   demonstrate the presence of persistent and coherent phase changes in a
   temporal sequence of DInSAR images, related solely to moisture change in
   a soil. This is confirmation of recent reports suggesting that, in some
   circumstances, the DInSAR signal may include a significant soil moisture
   signal. Laboratory measurements were used to obtain a set of
   high-resolution C-band DInSAR images of a sandy soil sample of an area
   of 2.0 m x 1.8 m and a depth of 0.2 m, with the fractional volumetric
   water content varying between 0.1 and 0.4. To independently monitor the
   soil surface for physical movement, a time-lapsed set of high-resolution
   digital optical images was continuously acquired. Although the soil
   underwent a large moisture change, the soil surface was static to within
   +/-0.1 mm over the majority of the experiment. The DInSAR sequence
   displayed dynamic and complex variations of the phase, although a linear
   relationship with moisture change was evident when the mean phase change
   was considered. The work raises the possibility that DInSAR could be
   used for the monitoring of soil moisture change in a scene, a parameter
   of significant economic and environmental importance.},

Abstract = {At the watershed scale, soil moisture is the major control for
   rainfall-runoff response, especially where saturation excess runoff
   processes dominate. From the ecological point of view, the pools of soil
   moisture are fundamental ecosystem resources providing the transpirable
   water for plants. In drylands particularly, soil moisture is one of the
   major controls on the structure, function, and diversity in ecosystems.
   In terms of the global hydrological cycle, the overall quantity of soil
   moisture is small, similar to 0.05\%; however, its importance to the
   global energy balance and the distribution of precipitation far
   outweighs its physical amount. In soils it governs microbial activity
   that affects important biogeochemical processes such as nitrification
   and CO2 production via respiration. During the past 20 years, technology
   has advanced considerably, with the development of different electrical
   sensors for determining soil moisture at a point. However, modeling of
   watersheds requires areal averages. As a result, point measurements and
   modeling grid cell data requirements are generally incommensurate. We
   review advances in sensor technology, particularly emerging geophysical
   methods and distributed sensors, aimed at bridging this gap. We consider
   some of the data analysis methods for upscaling from a point to give an
   areal average. Finally, we conclude by offering a vision for future
   research, listing many of the current scientific and technical
   challenges.},

Pages = {887-896},

Abstract = {This paper presents a multi-sensor remote sensing study of physically
   crusted soil with various moisture contents by using millimetre-wave
   backscatter radiation. The backscattered radiation was used to generate
   an empirical model to estimate soil moisture at the thin surface crust
   scale by using a set of soils with known moisture content as a
   reference. The model was then used to assess the moisture content of a
   new set of soils from the same group. Real-time measurement of soil
   moisture in the top layer beneath the soil crust is impractical at best
   and impossible using traditional methods. The proposed method,
   therefore, paves the way to assessing soil moisture content immediately
   beneath the surface crust as well as in a micro-profile at depths of 0-3
   cm. It can be combined with other active and passive remote sensing
   methods to provide a micro-profile measurement of soil moisture to the
   depth of the entire upper root zone (0-30 cm) and of the plough layer
   (0-20 cm) under undisturbed conditions. The method is based on the
   emerging technology of millimetre waves, which provide improved spatial
   resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Further
   development and use of the method described herein will make it simple
   and practical to analyse and understand the processes governing the
   soil-water interface. The major processes for which this information is
   important are soil crusting, water budgets (infiltration, runoff and
   evaporation) and soil erosion.},

Pages = {305-312},

Abstract = {Quantification of groundwater recharge is essential for water resources
   management. The water balance method is one of several methods for
   measuring event-based groundwater recharge. Soil moisture measurement
   data are essential for quantifying recharge using the water balance
   method. The spacing and zone of influence of soil moisture sensors used
   in a study are important factors for the accuracy of recharge
   calculations. A large lysimeter was used to measure the water balance
   components to quantify groundwater recharge in South Florida as a
   function of soil moisture and water table levels. Recharge was
   calculated using sensor spacings of 10 and 20 cm and zone of influence
   of 10 and 20 cm for seven major rainfall events. Recharge calculated
   with a sensor spacing of 20 cm had a relative root mean square error
   (RRMSE) of 33.1\% as compared with the 10-cm spacing. Recharge
   calculated using a zone of influence of 20 cm had an RRMSE of 38.8\% as
   compared with the 10-cm zone of influence. This error is attributed to
   soil moisture tensor discretization, which results in averaging the soil
   moisture in a soil layer containing the saturated and unsaturated zones
   interface, which leads to an overestimation of soil moisture in the
   unsaturated zone and an underestimation of soil moisture in the
   saturated zone. Vertical spacing of sensors larger than the `sensors'
   zone of influence also gives erroneous results as portions of the soil
   profile are not measured. For groundwater recharge calculations,
   selecting a sensor with suitable zone of influence and appropriate
   sensor spacing can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the
   calculations.},

Abstract = {Ground-penetrating radar is a fast noninvasive technique that can
   monitor subsurface structure and water-content distribution. To
   interpret traveltime information from single common-offset measurements,
   additional assumptions, such as constant permittivity, usually are
   required. We present a fast ground-penetrating-radar measurement
   technique using a multiple transmitter-and-receiver setup to measure
   simultaneously the reflector depth and average soil-water content. It
   can be considered a moving minicommon-midpoint measurement. For a simple
   analysis, we use a straightforward evaluation procedure that includes
   two traveltimes to the same reflector, obtained from different antenna
   separations. For a more accurate approach, an inverse evaluation
   procedure is added, using traveltimes obtained from all antenna
   separations at one position and its neighboring measurement locations.
   The evaluation of a synthetic data set with a lateral variability in
   reflector depth and an experimental example with a large variability in
   soil-water content are introduced to demonstrate the applicability for
   field-scale measurements. The crucial point for this application is the
   access to absolute traveltimes, which are difficult to determine
   accurately from common-offset measurements.},

Abstract = {Several newly developed sensors based on capacitance and frequency
   techniques have simplified real-time determination of soil water content
   (theta). The 10HS sensor is one of the most recent developments in
   capacitance sensors. However, up to now, little is known about the
   accuracy of this sensor, and the dependency of its measurements on soil
   type and environmental factors. In this study, the performance of the
   10HS sensor was investigated through experiments using liquids with
   known dielectric properties and experiments in a set of porous media
   exhibiting a wide range of properties. The response of the 10HS sensor
   in bilayered systems was also investigated. The experimental results
   suggested that there is a distinct instrument sensitivity to soil type,
   indicating the need for individual soil calibration. A set of specific
   calibration equations for the various porous materials studied were
   proposed. It was shown that the 10HS sensor is able to provide
   reasonably accurate relative permittivity (epsilon(r)) measurements, but
   the manufacturer's epsilon(r) calibration equation, to some extent,
   overestimates epsilon(r) in the full range of the measured values in
   liquids. The sensor to sensor variability was also found to be
   relatively small. It was shown that the manufacturer's calibration
   equation for measuring. Version 1 underestimates., whereas Version 3
   overestimates., in all porous materials examined. The most accurate
   results were provided by the proposed soil-specific calibration
   equations obtained using the multipoint calibration equations. However,
   the two-point calibration equations reasonably represent. in all porous
   media tested. Underestimation of soil moisture with increasing
   temperature in coarse porous media and overestimation in fine porous
   media were observed. The temperature dependence was more important in
   the fine porous media. The effect of electrical conductivities in sand
   was also examined, and it was found to be negligible. Finally, the
   sensors' response in bilayered systems generally follows the refractive
   averaging scheme at lower epsilon(r) values and the arithmetic averaging
   scheme at higher epsilon(r) values.

Abstract = {Most soil moisture sensor systems (SMSs) marketed for landscape
   irrigation respond to the dielectric permittivity of the soil. Compared
   to potable water (PW), reclaimed water (RW) may contain more salts,
   which can modify the dielectric permittivity of the soil and, hence,
   alter the readings of SMSs when measuring the soil water content. The
   main objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the functionality of
   four SMS brands and to quantify potential irrigation savings. Secondary
   objectives were to analyze the behavior consistency of three units
   within a brand to control irrigation, and to compare the brands. The
   experiment was carried out in Gainesville, Florida, under turfgrass
   plots irrigated with PW in 2009 and RW with an average salinity of 0.75
   dS/m during 2010. Four SMS brands (Acclima, AquaSpy, Baseline, and
   Dynamax) were selected and compared to a treatment without sensor
   feedback (WOS). Even though replicates of AquaSpy were statistically
   different under both PW and RW, all SMSs tested applied significantly
   less water than WOS. Water savings ranged 46\%- 78\% under PW, and 45\%-
   68\% under RW. Therefore, SMSs can be a useful tool for conserving water
   on turfgrass irrigated with either PW or RW.},

Abstract = {Frequency Domain Analysis is a well established technique in soil
   moisture determination, using the change in electrical capacitance of
   probes inserted into the soil caused by the presence of water. However
   it is known that temperature affects the determination of this
   capacitance. Here two different techniques are used, the first passing a
   fixed frequency through the soil via insulated probes, then measuring
   the amplitude of the resultant signal. The second uses the soil
   capacitance as the controlling component in a variable frequency
   oscillator, measuring the resultant times to charge and discharge. The
   measured capacitance is seen to be affected both by the temperature of
   the soil and, due to the sensitive nature of the monitoring electronics,
   also the temperature of critical components in the measurement circuits.
   Results from these experiments show that these two effects are
   complementary, soil temperature adding to the measured capacitance,
   whilst electronics temperature effectively decreases the measured
   capacitance. The daily profiles of the soil and electronics
   temperatures, whilst both rising during the day, and falling at night,
   show significant phase difference and therefore do not simply cancel
   out. Further, the strength of temperature compensation required is shown
   to vary with technique and moisture level. This paper explores these
   phenomena using results from a recently developed, four probe Frequency
   Domain capacitance based sensor costing around 12 Euros. These
   measurements are compared to those achieved by a commercial soil
   moisture system costing over 250 times this price. Preliminary results
   are presented from temperature compensation algorithms intended to
   minimize these effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Correcting aboveground hydrogen effects with thermal/fast neutron ratio},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2016},

Pages = {923-933},

Abstract = {The cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CANS), which estimates field scale soil
   water content, bridges the gap between point measurement and remote
   sensing. The accuracy of CRNS measurements, however, is affected by
   additional hydrogen pools (e.g., vegetation, snow, and rainfall
   interception). The objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the
   accuracy of CRNS estimates in a farmland system using depth and
   horizontal weighted point measurements, (ii) introduce a novel method
   for estimating the amounts of hydrogen from biomass and snow cover in
   CRNS data, and (iii) propose a simple approach for correcting the
   influences of aboveground hydrogen pool (expressed as aboveground water
   equivalent, AWE) on CRNS measurements. A field experiment was conducted
   in northeast China to compare soil water content results from CANS to
   in-situ data with time domain reflectometry (TDR) and neutron probe (NP)
   in the 0-40 cm soil layers. The biomass water equivalent (BWE) and snow
   water equivalent (SWE) were observed to have separate linear
   relationships with the thermal fast neutron ratio, and the dynamics of
   BWE and SWE were estimated correctly in the crop seasons and
   snow-covered seasons, respectively. A simple approach, which considered
   the AWE, AWE at calibration, and the effective measurement depth of
   CRNS, was introduced to correct the errors caused by BWE and SWE. After
   correction, the correlation coefficients between soil water contents
   determined by CRNS and TDR were 0.79 and 0.77 during the 2014 and 2015
   crop seasons, respectively, and CRNS measurements had RMSEs of 0.028,
   0.030, and 0.039 m(3) m(-3) in the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons and the
   snow-covered seasons, respectively. The experimental results also
   indicated that the accuracies of CRNS estimated BWE and SWE were
   affected by the distributions of aboveground hydrogen pools, which were
   related to the height of the CRNS device above ground surface. (C) 2016

Title = {Evaluating model-based relationship of cone index, soil water content

Abstract = {The relationship among cone index (CI), soil water content (theta) and
   bulk density (D-b) plays a critical role in assessing soil physical
   conditions. To predict Db as functions of the measurements of CI and
   theta, a variety of semi-empirical CI-models have been established
   historically, however a study for validating these models has not been
   found. In this study four CI-models, one considered the penetration
   depth as variable but others did not, were evaluated under laboratory
   condition. The methodology was to use our own developed dual-sensor
   vertical penetrometer (DSVP) to simultaneously measure Cl and volumetric
   soil water content (9,), and then to compare the bulk density (Db)
   core-measured to that model-predicted by the DSVP data. Two types of
   soil samples (silt-loam and clay) were tested. Because a previous study
   speculated that penetration depth could confound the CI measured, two
   depth-dependent factors were incorporated into each CI-model for
   validating this speculation. Our study found that two of the four models
   tested fit the experimental data with acceptable R-2 (> 0.70) and RMSE
   (< 0.093 g cm-(3)). In contrast, the experimental results confirmed that
   CI in Model-1 had a peak value adapting a wide range of a More ever, the
   results indicated that the DSVP combined with Model-1 or Model-2 can be
   used as a tool to predict Db when CI and 9 are simultaneously measured.

Title = {Assimilating remote sensing observations of leaf area index and soil
   moisture for wheat yield estimates: An observing system simulation
   experiment},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Month = {MAY 17},
Abstract = {Observing system simulation experiments were used to investigate
   ensemble Bayesian state-updating data assimilation of observations of
   leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture (theta) for the purpose of
   improving single-season wheat yield estimates with the Decision Support
   System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CropSim-Ceres model.
   Assimilation was conducted in an energy-limited environment and a
   water-limited environment. Modeling uncertainty was prescribed to
   weather inputs, soil parameters and initial conditions, and cultivar
   parameters and through perturbations to model state transition
   equations. The ensemble Kalman filter and the sequential importance
   resampling filter were tested for the ability to attenuate effects of
   these types of uncertainty on yield estimates. LAI and theta
   observations were synthesized according to characteristics of existing
   remote sensing data, and effects of observation error were tested.
   Results indicate that the potential for assimilation to improve
   end-of-season yield estimates is low. Limitations are due to a lack of
   root zone soil moisture information, error in LAI observations, and a
   lack of correlation between leaf and grain growth.},

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) content plays an important role in a number
   of physical processes involving the energy and mass exchanges between
   the land and atmosphere interactions. Determination of spatially
   complete SSM in regional scale has long been one of the most significant
   tasks in remote-sensing community. Although with limited penetrating
   ability comparing to microwave missions, optical/thermal infrared
   sensors can provide surface observations at finer spatial resolution. On
   the basis of a recently developed approach for deriving all-weather SSM
   content from satellite images, the present study investigates an
   optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system for mapping
   finer spatial resolution all-weather soil moisture content in China from
   the combined use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) and the China Meteorological Administration Land Data
   Assimilation System (CLDAS) meteorological products. A preliminary
   evaluation of the all-weather SSM retrieval is implemented with field
   SSM measurements at 461 sites across China. Results show that the root
   mean square error (RMSE) varies from 0.053 to 0.070m(3) m(-3) with an
   average RMSE of 0.063m(3) m(-3) and an average bias of -0.018m(3) m(-3)
   obtained on the six selected days from April to September. These first
   results of all-weather SSM retrieval indicate that the optical/thermal
   remote-sensing-based operational system has a promising perspective for
   mapping SSM with currently available satellite and meteorological
   products in regional scale. Finally, two practical recommendations with
   respective to improve the system inputs for producing more reliable SSM
   products are summarized for further developments of the optical/thermal
   remote-sensing-based operational system.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROMETEOROLOGY},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {116-131},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {This study aims at stimulating the development of soil moisture data
   assimilation systems in a direction where they can provide both the
   necessary control of slow drift in operational NWP applications and
   support the physical insight in the performance of the land surface
   component. It addresses four topics concerning the systematic nature of
   soil moisture data assimilation experiments over Europe during the
   growing season of 2000 involving the European Centre for Medium-Range
   Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model infrastructure. In the first topic the
   effect of the (spinup related) bias in 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40)
   precipitation on the data assimilation is analyzed. From results
   averaged over 36 European locations, it appears that about half of the
   soil moisture increments in the 2000 growing season are attributable to
   the precipitation bias. A second topic considers a new soil moisture
   data assimilation system, demonstrated in a coupled single-column model
   (SCM) setup, where precipitation and radiation are derived from
   observations instead of from atmospheric model fields. For many of the
   considered locations in this new system, the accumulated soil moisture
   increments still exceed the interannual variability estimated from a
   multiyear offline land surface model run. A third topic examines the
   soil water budget in response to these svstematic increments. For a
   number of Mediterranean locations the increments successfully increase
   the surface evaporation, as is expected from the fact that atmospheric
   moisture deficit information is the key driver of soil moisture
   adjustment. In many other locations, however, evaporation is constrained
   by the experimental SCM setup and is hardly affected by the data
   assimilation. Instead, a major portion of the increments eventually
   leave the soil as runoff. In the fourth topic observed evaporation is
   used to evaluate the impact of the data assimilation on the forecast
   quality. In most cases, the difference between the control and data
   assimilation runs is considerably smaller than the (positive) difference
   between any of the simulations and the observations.},

Abstract = {Modeling of soil water content (SWC) is one of the most studied topics
   in hydrology due to its essential application to water resources
   management. In this study, an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system
   (ANFIS) method is used to simulate SWC in the extreme arid area. In-situ
   SWC datasets for soil layers, with depths of 40 cm (layer 1), 60 cm
   (layer 2) below surface was taken for the present study. The models
   analyzed different combinations of antecedent SWC values and the
   appropriate input vector has been selected based on the analysis of
   residuals. The performance of the ANFIS models in training and
   validation sets are compared with the observed data. In layer 1, the
   model which consists of six antecedent values of SWC, has been selected
   as the best fit model for SWC modeling. On the other hand, which
   includes two antecedent values of SWC, has been selected as the best fit
   model for SWC modeling at layer 2. In order to assess the ability of
   ANFIS model relative to that of the ANN model, the best fit of ANFIS
   model of layer 1 and layer 2 structures are also tested by two
   artificial neural networks (ANN), namely, Levenberg-Marquardt
   feedforward neural network (ANN-1) and Bayesian regularization
   feedforward neural network (ANN-2). The comparison was made according to
   the various statistical measures. A detailed comparison of the overall
   performance indicated that the ANFIS model performed better than both
   the ANN-1 and ANN-2 in SWC modeling for the validation data sets in this
   study. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The availability of reliable long-term and large scale soil moisture
   observation datasets over the Tibetan Plateau has been of more concern
   in recent years. It is therefore necessary to verify any such data to
   have a better guide to their usage. In this study, we have compared
   satellite soil moisture retrievals of the Special Sensor Microwave
   Imager (SSM/I), with ERA-Interim/Land and Global Land Data Assimilation
   System (GLDAS-1) soil moisture products over the Tibetan Plateau. They
   are found to be largely different from each other regarding the soil
   moisture magnitudes in spring, summer and autumn, with those of the
   ERA-Interim/Land particularly higher than the other datasets in the
   eastern plateau. The SSM/I and the ERA-Interim/Land data are in good
   agreement considering their seasonal dynamics, which are however
   considerably different from the GLDAS-1 models (CLM, Noah, Mosaic and
   VIC). For interannual variations, it is striking to find strong negative
   correlations (R < -0.6) between the SSM/I and the ERA-Interim/Land data
   in spring and autumn, especially over the central plateau. The SSM/I
   data is found to have also strong negative correlations (R < -0.4) with
   data of the four GLDAS-1 models in the eastern plateau in spring; and
   such negative correlations appear in central and western plateau in
   autumn. In summer, the SSM/I data appears to be positively correlated
   with the ERA-Interim/Land and all the GLDAS-1 data over the plateau. The
   negative correlations indicate these data have quite different temporal
   dynamics for their interannual variations, especially in spring and
   autumn. A look at the spatial variations revealed that the SSM/I data
   shows a north-south seesaw pattern in all seasons. The GLDAS-1 Mosaic,
   Noah and CLM data are able to represent this seesaw pattern principally,
   which however, can hardly be seen in the ERA-Interim/Land and the
   GLDAS-1 VIC data. Our results have indicated significant uncertainties
   in the soil moisture data from remote sensing and reanalysis sources;
   and we have to use such data with great care.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important hydrological parameter, which is essential
   for a variety of applications, thereby extending to numerous
   disciplines. Currently, there are three methods of estimating soil
   moisture: ground-based (in-situ) measurements; remote sensing based
   methods and land surface models. In recent years, the cosmic ray probe
   (CRP), which is an in-situ technique, has been implemented in several
   countries across the globe. The CRP provides area-averaged soil moisture
   at an intermediate scale and thus bridges the gap between in-situ point
   measurements and global satellite-based soil moisture estimates. The aim
   of this study was to test the suitability of the CRP to provide spatial
   estimates of soil moisture. The CRP was set up and calibrated in
   Cathedral Peak Catchment VI. An in-situ soil moisture network consisting
   of time-domain reflectometry and Echo probes was created in Catchment
   VI, and was used to validate the CRP soil moisture estimates. Once
   calibrated, the CRP was found to provide spatial estimates of soil
   moisture, which correlated well with the in-situ soil moisture network
   data set and yielded an R-2 value of 0.845. The use of the CRP for soil
   moisture monitoring provided reliable, accurate and continuous soil
   moisture estimates over the catchment area. The wealth of current and
   potential applications makes the CRP very appealing for scientists and
   engineers in various fields.},

Abstract = {At global scale nutrient flows are unbalanced, resulting in huge
   surpluses in Western Europe versus negative balances in Africa. Existing
   policy and socio-economic environments in different parts of the world
   are the major cause of this situation. At lower spatial scales, a much
   more complex and diverse picture emerges. In Sub-Saharan Africa,
   different levels and causes of soil fertility decline are found among
   agro-ecological zones, soil types, farm systems, wealth groups,
   urban-rural households, cash and food crops, home fields and bush
   fields.
   Technology development has been the traditional response to address
   nutrient imbalances in general, and soil fertility decline in Africa in
   particular. Farm households have continued to develop and adapt existing
   technology to changing situations. National and international research
   institutions have followed a variety of changing approaches of which the
   recently developed participatory approaches have yielded some impressive
   results in isolated cases. These efforts have, however, not led to the
   necessary massive reversion of the trend in soil fertility decline. The
   Dutch policies on nutrient use and the Indonesian policy to adopt
   Integrated Pest Management are two examples, associated with such major
   trend reversions. This suggests that promoting and supporting
   participatory technologies have limited impact when no attention is paid
   to participatory policy development and implementation.
   In order to mobilise farm households in a trend reversion, a number of
   conditions should be met such as stable prices for agricultural outputs,
   better input/output prices ratios, influence of land users on the
   research agenda and private-public initiatives focused on smallholders.
   This observation calls for the establishment of interactive
   landusers-science-policy triangles at various scales (local, national
   and international) in which joint learning and mediating may lead to
   more informed decision making, more focused design of an agricultural
   sector policy, implementation of policies by effective institutions, and
   appropriate technology development and implementation. Interventions
   need to be reoriented: less technology development, more policy
   influence and institution building. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron probes are widely used to monitor environmental water
   content near the surface. The method averages over tens of hectares and
   is unrivaled in serving representative data for agriculture and
   hydrological models at the hectometer scale. Recent experiments,
   however, indicate that the sensor response to environmental
   heterogeneity is not fully understood. Knowledge of the support volume
   is a prerequisite for the proper interpretation and validation of
   hydrogeophysical data. In a previous study, several physical
   simplifications have been introduced into a neutron transport model in
   order to derive the characteristics of the cosmic-ray probe's footprint.
   We utilize a refined source and energy spectrum for cosmic-ray neutrons
   and simulate their response to a variety of environmental conditions.
   Results indicate that the method is particularly sensitive to soil
   moisture in the first tens of meters around the probe, whereas the
   radial weights are changing dynamically with ambient water. The
   footprint radius ranges from 130 to 240 m depending on air humidity,
   soil moisture, and vegetation. The moisture-dependent penetration depth
   of 15 to 83 cm decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor.
   However, the footprint circle remains almost isotropic in complex
   terrain with nearby rivers, roads or hill slopes. Our findings suggest
   that a dynamically weighted average of point measurements is essential
   for accurate calibration and validation. The new insights will have
   important impact on signal interpretation, sensor installation, data
   interpolation from mobile surveys, and the choice of appropriate
   resolutions for data assimilation into hydrological models.},

   values representative of the mean behaviour at the medium-sized river
   basin scale, which is useful for remote sensing validation analysis and
   rainfall-runoff modeling. To this end, 23 measurements campaigns were
   carried out during a time span of 14 months at 20 sites located within
   the Upper Chiascio River Basin, a catchment with a drainage area of
   about 460 km(2) in the Umbria Region (central Italy). The data set
   allowed the analysis of both soil moisture temporal stability and its
   dynamics. On the basis of statistical and temporal stability approaches,
   it was investigated how factors such as climatic regime and
   geomorphology influence soil moisture behaviour. For the investigated
   area, the spatial variability of soil moisture was higher in dry periods
   with respect to wet periods, mainly due to the rainfall pattern
   characteristics during different periods of the year. Soil moisture
   values recorded during wet periods showed a better correlation than
   those recorded during dry periods. The maximum number of required
   samples, to obtain the mean areal soil moisture with an absolute error
   of 3\% vol/vol, was found equal to 12. The temporal stability analysis
   showed that during wet periods just one ``optimal{''} measurement point
   can provide values of soil moisture representative of the catchment-mean
   behaviour, while during dry periods the number of ``optimal{''}
   measurement points became equal to two. Therefore, at the adopted
   spatial scale the use of a single measurement point can lead to
   significant errors. From the perspective of soil moisture dynamics, the
   decomposition of the spatial variance showed that the contribution of
   the time-invariant component (temporal mean of each site) was
   predominant on respect to the total spatial variance of absolute soil
   moisture data, for almost the whole observation period. Results provided
   guidance to optimize soil moisture sampling by performing targeted
   measurements at a few selected points representative of the
   catchment-mean behaviour.},

Abstract = {Multisphere interactions over the Tibetan Plateau directly impact its
   surrounding climate and environment at a variety of spatiotemporal
   scales. Remote sensing and modeling are expected to provide
   hydrometeorological data needed for these process studies, but in situ
   observations are required to support their calibration and validation.
   For this purpose, we have established a dense monitoring network on the
   central Tibetan Plateau to measure two state variables (soil moisture
   and temperature) at three spatial scales (1.0 degrees, 0.3 degrees, and
   0.1 degrees) and four soil depths (0-5, 10, 20, and 40 cm). The
   experimental area is characterized by low biomass, high soil moisture
   dynamic range, and typical freeze-thaw cycle. The network consists of 56
   stations with their elevation varying over 4470-4950 m. As auxiliary
   parameters of this network, soil texture and soil organic carbon content
   are measured at each station to support further studies. To guarantee
   continuous and high-quality data, tremendous efforts have been made to
   protect the data-logger from soil water intrusion, to calibrate soil
   moisture sensors, and to upscale the point measurements. As the highest
   soil moisture network above sea level in the world, our network meets
   the requirement for evaluating a variety of soil moisture products and
   for soil moisture scaling analyses. It also directly contributes to the
   soil-water-ice-air-ecosystem interaction studies on the third pole. The
   data will be publicized via the International Soil Moisture Network and
   the recent 2-yr data will become accessible soon.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the spatial representativeness of the temporal
   dynamics of absolute soil moisture and its temporal anomalies over North
   America based on a range of data sets. We use three main data sources:
   in situ observations, the remote-sensing-based data set of the European
   Space Agency Climate Change Initiative on the Essential Climate Variable
   soil moisture (ECV-SM), and land surface model estimates from European
   Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts's ERA-Land. The
   intercomparisons of the three soil moisture data sources are performed
   at the in situ locations as well as for the full-gridded products. The
   applied method allows us to quantify the spatial footprint of soil
   moisture. At the in situ locations it is shown that for absolute soil
   moisture the ECV-SM and ERA-Land products perform similarly, while for
   the temporal anomalies the ECV-SM product shows more similarity in
   spatial representativeness with the in situ data. When taking into
   account all grid cells of the ECV-SM and ERA-Land products to calculate
   spatial representativeness, we find the largest differences in spatial
   representativeness for the absolute values. The differences in spatial
   representativeness between the single products can be related to some of
   their intrinsic characteristics, i.e., for ECV-SM low similarities are
   found in topographically complex terrain and areas with dense
   vegetation, while for ERA-Land the smoothed model topography and surface
   properties affect soil moisture and its spatial representativeness.
   Additionally, we show that the applied method is robust and can be used
   to analyze existing networks to provide insight into the locations in
   which higher station density would be of most benefit.},

Abstract = {Scaling processes are increasingly understood to be the result of
   nonlinear dynamic mechanisms repeating scale after scale from large to
   small scales leading to nonclassical resolution dependencies. This means
   that the statistical properties systematically vary in strong, power-law
   ways with the resolution. When present in geophysical and remotely
   sensed fields, it implies that when classical (single-scale) remote
   sensing algorithms are used to determine surrogates of various
   geophysical fields, they can at most be correct at the unique (and
   subjective) calibration resolution. Scaling analysis and modeling
   techniques were applied to MODIS TERRA Bands I through 7 and to the
   standard derived vegetation and soil moisture indices in order to
   quantitatively characterize the wide range of scaling of these fields,
   The scaling exponents we found are not so large; however, they act
   across wide scale ranges and imply large effects. For example, for the
   statistics near the mean, the MODIS (500-m) resolution would be biased
   by a factor of similar to 1.52 when compared with similar results from
   an ``ideal{''} sensor at 1-mm resolution. Applying the standard index
   algorithms on lower and lower resolution satellite data, we obtained
   indices with significantly different statistical properties than if the
   same algorithm was used at the finest resolution and then degraded to an
   intermediate value (a difference of a factor similar to 1.54). This
   shows that the algorithms can, at best, be accurate at the unique
   calibration scale and this points to the need to develop
   resolution-independent algorithms based on the scaling exponents.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to, e.g.,
   farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. Here, we present
   a method to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Sentinel-1
   (S-1) satellites, which carry C-hand Synthetic Aperture Radar (CSAR)
   sensors that provide the richest freely available SAR data source so
   far, unprecedented in accuracy and coverage. Our SSM retrieval method,
   adapting well-established change detection algorithms, builds the first
   globally deployable soil moisture observation data set with 1-km
   resolution. This paper provides an algorithm formulation to be operated
   in data cube architectures and high-performance computing environments.
   It includes the novel dynamic Gaussian upscaling method for spatial
   upscaling of SAR imagery, harnessing its field-scale information and
   successfully mitigating effects from the SAR's high signal complexity.
   Also, a new regression-based approach for estimating the radar slope is
   defined, coping with Sentinel-1's inhomogeneity in spatial coverage. We
   employ the S-1 SSM algorithm on a 3-year S-1 data cube over Italy,
   obtaining a consistent set of model parameters and product masks,
   unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of therefrom
   generated S-1 SSM data, involving a 1-km soil water balance model over
   Umbria, yields high agreement over plains and agricultural areas, with
   low agreement over forests and strong topography. While positive biases
   during the growing season are detected, the excellent capability to
   capture small-scale soil moisture changes as from rainfall or irrigation
   is evident. The S-1 SSM is currently in preparation toward operational
   product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical consideration for agriculture and hydrology
   especially in semi-arid regions. Like groundwater, soil moisture
   measurements may not always available in sufficient distributions for
   effective monitoring of agricultural operations. This paper presents a
   quasi-terrestrial water balance method, driven by common hydro-climatic
   data, to estimate soil moisture. The method is tested for the
   approximate to 152 000 km(2) floodplain region of Hai River Basin using
   48 consecutive months (January 2003-December 2006) of data. Comparisons
   of the estimated and field-measured soil moisture storage and storage
   change show favorable agreements at monthly, seasonal yearly cycles.
   This suggests that the proposed method reliably detects soil moisture
   storage signal in the tested region. The analysis shows a narrowing soil
   moisture storage change in the study area. Further analysis indicates
   that the narrowing in soil moisture storage change is sustained by
   groundwater storage loss via irrigation. There is also storage loss to
   the atmosphere via irrigation-driven evapotranspiration. Apparently,
   storage gain occurs in summer while storage loss occurs in winter.
   However, an overall storage loss exists in the tested floodplain region
   of Hai River Basin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A new approach to estimate soil moisture (SM) based on evaporative
   fraction (EF) retrieved from optical/thermal infrared MODIS data is
   presented for Canadian Prairies in parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta. An
   EF model using the remotely sensed land surface temperature
   (Ts)/vegetation index concept was modified by incorporating North
   American Regional Reanalysis (NAAR) Ta data and used for SM estimation.
   Two different combinations of temperature and vegetation fraction using
   the difference between Ts from MODIS Aqua and Terra images and Ta from
   NARR data (Ts-Ta Aqua-day and Ts-Ta Terra-day, respectively) were
   proposed and the results were compared with those obtained from a
   previously improved model (Delta Ts Aqua-DayNight) as a reference. For
   the estimation of SM from EF, two empirical models were tested and
   discussed to find the most appropriate model for converting
   MODIS-derived EF data to SM values. Estimated SM values were then
   correlated with in situ SM measurements and their relationships were
   statistically analyzed. Results indicated statistically significant
   correlations between SM estimated from all three EF estimation
   approaches and field measured SM values (R-2 = 0.42-0.77, p values <
   0.04) exhibiting the possibility to estimate SM from remotely sensed EF
   models. The proposed Ts-Ta MODIS Aqua-day and Terra-day approaches
   resulted in better estimations of SM (on average higher R-2 values and
   similar RMSEs) as compared with the Delta Ts reference approach
   indicating that the concept of incorporating NARR Ta data into
   Ts/Vegetation index model improved soil moisture estimation accuracy
   based on evaporative fraction. The accuracies of the predictions were
   found to be considerably better for intermediate SM values (from 12 to
   22 vol/vol\%) with square errors averaging below 11 (vol/vol\%)(2). This
   indicates that the model needs further improvements to account for
   extreme soil moisture conditions. The findings of this research can be
   potentially used to downscale SM estimations obtained from passive
   microwave remote sensing techniques. (C) 2013 International Society for

Abstract = {Since 2000, the network of stations that make up the Czech
   Hydrometeorological Institute (CHMI) has measured the soil moisture
   content at the 0- to 0.9-m layer using sensors placed within the natural
   soil profile under closely cropped grass cover. Using information from 8
   years of continuous observation at seven stations throughout the Czech
   Republic, we verified the usefulness of the Soil Moisture Index (SMI).
   The SMI is a potentially useful index for calculating the water deficit
   in the Czech Republic and Central Europe. During this period, a
   statistically significant decrease in moisture content was detected, and
   negative SMI values predominated. There were frequent occurrences of
   flash drought, defined as a very rapid decline in soil moisture during a
   3-week period. The CHMI can use SMI values below -3 in the Integrated
   Warning Service System. The routine calculation of SMI values can alert
   agricultural producers to the development of flash drought conditions
   and provide them with information regarding the effectiveness of recent
   rainfall events. An increase in soil moisture, in contrast, could serve
   as a warning sign for hydrology because it creates the preconditions for
   flooding. The complex study of soil humidity regimes is becoming more
   significant in connection with current global climatic change warnings

Abstract = {In this work, we present are view of the results obtained in the
   exploitation of percolation theory and the renormalization group method
   in the study of soil moisture spatial patterns.
   In order to capture critical point in soil moisture spatio-temporal
   dynamics, we developed an algorithm consisting of three steps: (i)
   dichotomization, i.e., transforming the soil moisture maps into binary
   maps; (ii) identification of the largest wet cluster; (iii) scaling
   transformation, i.e., applying an ad hoc implemented coarse-graining
   procedure to the binary maps.
   The methodology was explored by means of several applications on soil
   moisture data coming from field measurement, remote sensing, and
   hydrological modelling over a wide range of spatial scales. From the
   relations between the occupation probability in soil moisture spatial
   patterns and the normalized size of the largest cluster at different
   scales, as well as the scaling behaviour, it is possible to argue that
   also for this physical system the critical point theory applies.
   The critical probability seems to be a structural feature of the
   catchment, being insensitive to the scale of the analysis, as well as to
   the parameterization of the methodology.},

Abstract = {The soil water content profile is often well correlated with the soil
   moisture state near the surface. They share mutual information such that
   analysis of surface-only soil moisture is, at times and in conjunction
   with precipitation information, reflective of deeper soil fluxes and
   dynamics. This study examines the characteristic length scale, or
   effective depth Delta z, of a simple active hydrological control volume.
   The volume is described only by precipitation inputs and soil water
   dynamics evident in surface-only soil moisture observations. To proceed,
   first an observation-based technique is presented to estimate the soil
   moisture loss function based on analysis of soil moisture dry-downs and
   its successive negative increments. Then, the length scale Delta z is
   obtained via an optimization process wherein the root-mean-squared (RMS)
   differences between surface soil moisture observations and its
   predictions based on water balance are minimized. The process is
   entirely observation-driven. The surface soil moisture estimates are
   obtained from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and
   precipitation from the gauge-corrected Climate Prediction Center daily
   global precipitation product. The length scale Delta z exhibits a clear
   east-west gradient across the contiguous United States (CONUS), such
   that large Delta z depths (>200 mm) are estimated in wetter regions with
   larger mean precipitation. The median Delta z across CONUS is 135 mm.
   The spatial variance of Delta z is predominantly explained and
   influenced by precipitation characteristics. Soil properties, especially
   texture in the form of sand fraction, as well as the mean soil moisture
   state have a lesser influence on the length scale.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the findings from a research conducted to
   investigate the effects of moisture and environmental conditions on the
   mechanical behaviour of granular pavements. Analysis was conducted on
   data collected from state-of-the-art instrumentation on two field
   pavement sites located in Sunshine Coast, Australia. The sites were
   monitored over three years, and daily temperature, moisture and strain
   values were analysed. Large tensile strains in the basecourse occurred
   when moisture increased and temperature decreased at the end of day.
   This result indicated that the change in soil pore pressure due to
   moisture and temperature variations was causing the strains in the
   pavement. Heavy traffic volume had a minor effect on basecourse strain
   in comparison to moisture and temperature although, it was concluded
   that the combined effect of soil moisture, temperature and heavy traffic
   loading was a cause for large vertical strains in the pavement.},

Number = {1},
Pages = {56-67},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A novel methodology is introduced for quantifying the added value of
   remotely sensed soil moisture products for global land surface modeling
   applications. The approach is based on the assimilation of soil moisture
   retrievals into a simple surface water balance model driven by
   satellite-based precipitation products. Filter increments (i.e.,
   discrete additions or subtractions of water suggested by the filter) are
   then compared to antecedent precipitation errors determined using
   higher-quality rain gauge observations. A synthetic twin experiment
   demonstrates that the correlation coefficient between antecedent
   precipitation errors and filter increments provides an effective proxy
   for the accuracy of the soil moisture retrievals themselves. Given the
   inherent difficulty of directly validating remotely sensed soil moisture
   products using ground-based observations, this assimilation-based proxy
   provides a valuable tool for efforts to improve soil moisture retrieval
   strategies and quantify the novel information content of remotely sensed
   soil moisture retrievals for land surface modeling applications. Using
   real spaceborne data, the approach is demonstrated for four different
   remotely sensed soil moisture datasets along two separate transects in
   the southern United States. Results suggest that the relative
   superiority of various retrieval strategies varies geographically.},

Abstract = {The Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) method has been a
   topic of much discussion, especially in the last three decades.
   Recently, Michel et al. (2005) pointed out several inconsistencies in
   the soil moisture accounting (SMA) procedure used in the SCS-CN method
   and developed a procedure that is more consistent from the SMA
   viewpoint. However, the model proposed by them does not have any
   expression for initial soil moisture store level (VO) and hence there is
   a scope for further improvement. Like the original method, there is
   sudden jump in Vo and therefore a quantum jump in computed runoff is
   possible. In the present study, an attempt is made to develop an
   expression for Vo to make the model a continuous watershed model. Then,
   the performance of the new model is compared with the model proposed by
   Michel et al. and the original SCS-CN model by applying them in a large
   number of small watersheds in the United States. The present model was
   found to perform significantly better than both the original SCS-CN
   model and the model proposed by Michel et al. Copyright (c) 2007 John

Abstract = {In a period of surging energy prices, resource depletion, and concerns
   over the use of nuclear power, energy savings are paramount and a major
   component of ongoing sustainable development. Geothermal energy is the
   energy stored in the form of heat beneath the surface of the Earth.
   Related to this, the thermal properties of soils are of great
   importance, particularly with regard to the modern trends of utilizing
   the subsurface for transmission of either heated fluids or high power
   currents. For example, in geothermal hydrology or geotechnical
   engineering applications, the thermal conductivity must be determined to
   assess the energy potential of the soil. The presence of water
   (groundwater, rainfall, natural moisture) improves both the thermal
   conductivity and thermal capacity fields. We present an original
   method-based on a thermal study and the use of non-integer order
   models-to determine the thermophysical parameters of different soils in
   near-surface layers, and link them to the water content variations of
   different soils. The results are compared with those obtained using a
   capacitive profile probe. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Abstract = {Particle-size distribution (PSD), especially clay content, is an
   important physical property of soil because of its large influence on
   soil hydrological characteristics, salinity, fertility, erodibility,
   nutrient content, swelling/shrinking, and degradation. The authors
   present a case study of soil PSD and its relationship with soil-water
   content (SWC) in a gravel-mulched field in an arid area of northwestern
   China using a statistical regression model and Pearson correlation
   coefficients. The SWC was correlated with clay content, and both
   increased with soil depth, with correlation coefficients ranging from
   0.901 to 0.972. The regression analysis of clay content and SWC from
   various depths used the least-squares method, and the predictive
   accuracies of the regression models were evaluated with the data for
   measured clay content. Both the mean error and root mean square error
   were low and the prediction accuracy was high. The SWCs were
   significantly positively correlated between soil layers, with all
   correlation coefficients greater than 0.989, indicating that the SWC in
   a specific layer could be well estimated by the SWC in the adjacent
   subsoil. Clay content can thus be predicted from measured SWC, and can
   be further used to evaluate soil quality and productivity. This study
   also provides a theoretical reference for the prevention of
   salinization, the adjustment of land use and agricultural production,
   and the conservation of soil and water. (C) 2017 American Society of

Abstract = {This research addressed the temporal and spatial variation of soil
   moisture (SM) in a heterogeneous landscape. The research objective was
   to investigate soil moisture variation in eight homogeneous 30 by 30 m
   plots, similar to the pixel size of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or
   Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) image. The plots were adjacent to
   eight stations of an in situ soil moisture network operated by the
   United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service
   USDA-ARS in Tifton, GA. We also studied five adjacent agricultural
   fields to examine the effect of different landuses/land covers (LULC)
   (grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil) on the temporal and
   spatial variation of soil moisture. Soil moisture field data were
   collected on eight occasions throughout 2005 and January 2006 to
   establish comparisons within and among eight homogeneous plots.
   Consistently throughout time, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high
   variation in the soil moisture behavior among the plots and high
   homogeneity in the soil moisture behavior within them. A precipitation
   analysis for the eight sampling dates throughout the year 2005 showed
   similar rainfall conditions for the eight study plots. Therefore, soil
   moisture variation among locations was explained by in situ local
   conditions. Temporal stability geostatistical analysis showed that soil
   moisture has high temporal stability within the small plots and that a
   single point reading can be used to monitor soil moisture status for the
   plot within a maximum 3\% volume/volume (v/v) soil moisture variation.
   Similarly, t-statistic analysis showed that soil moisture status in the
   upper soil layer changes within 24 h. We found statistical differences
   in the soil moisture between the different LULC in the agricultural
   fields as well as statistical differences between these fields and the
   adjacent 30 by 30 m plots. From this analysis, it was demonstrated that
   spatial proximity is not enough to produce similar soil moisture, since
   t-test's among adjacent plots with different LULCs showed significant
   differences. These results confirm that a remote sensing approach that
   considers homogeneous LULC landscape fragments can be used to identify
   landscape units of similar soil moisture behavior under heterogeneous
   landscapes. In addition, the in situ USDA-ARS network wilt serve better
   in remote sensing studies in which sensors with fine spatial resolution
   are evaluated. This study is a first step towards identifying landscape
   units that can be monitored using the single point reading of the
   USDA-ARS stations network. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A fast TDR-inversion technique for the reconstruction of spatial soil
   moisture content},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {9},
Number = {5},
Pages = {481-492},
Abstract = {Spatial moisture distribution in natural soil or other material is a
   valuably information for many applications. Standard measurement
   techniques give only mean or punctual results. Therefore a new inversion
   algorithm has been developed to derive moisture profiles along single
   TDR sensor-probes. The algorithm uses the full information content of
   TDR reflection data measured from one or both sides of an embedded
   probe. The system consisting of sensor probe and surrounded soil can be
   interpreted as a nonuniform transmission-line. The algorithm is based on
   the telegraph equations for nonuniform transmission-lines and an
   optimization approach to reconstruct the distribution of the capacitance
   and effective conductance along the transmission-line with high spatial
   resolution. The capacitance distribution can be converted into
   permittivity and water content by means of a capacitance model and
   dielectric mixing rules. Numerical investigations have been carried out
   to verify the accuracy of the inversion algorithm. Single- and
   double-sided time-domain reflection data were used to determine the
   capacitance and effective conductance profiles of lossless and lossy
   materials. The results show that single-sided reflection data are
   sufficient for lossless (or low-loss) cases. In case of lossy material
   two independent reflection measurements are required to reconstruct a
   reliable capacitance profile. The inclusion of an additional effective
   conductivity profile leads to an improved capacitance profile. The
   algorithm converges very fast and yields a capacitance profile within a
   sufficiently short time. The additional transformation to the water
   content requires no significant calculation time.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of active
   infrared thermography and thermometry in combination with multivariate
   statistical partial least squares analysis as rapid soil water content
   detection techniques both in the laboratory and the field. Such
   techniques allow fast soil water content measurements helpful in both
   agricultural and environmental fields. These techniques, based on the
   theory of heat dissipation, were tested by directly measuring
   temperature dynamic variation of samples after heating. For the
   assessment of temperature dynamic variations data were collected during
   three intervals (3, 6 and 10 s). To account for the presence of specific
   heats differences between water and soil, the analyses were regulated
   using slopes to linearly describe their trends. For all analyses, the
   best model was achieved for a 10 s slope. Three different approaches
   were considered, two in the laboratory and one in the field. The first
   laboratory-based one was centred on active infrared thermography,
   considered measurement of temperature variation as independent variable
   and reported r = 0.74. The second laboratory-based one was focused on
   active infrared thermometry, added irradiation as independent variable
   and reported r = 0.76. The in-field experiment was performed by active
   infrared thermometry, heating bare soil by solar irradiance after
   exposure due to primary tillage. Some meteorological parameters were
   inserted as independent variables in the prediction model, which
   presented r = 0.61. In order to obtain more general and wide estimations
   in-field a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis on three classes
   of percentage of soil water content was performed obtaining a high
   correct classification in the test (88.89\%). The prediction error
   values were lower in the field with respect to laboratory analyses. Both
   techniques could be used in conjunction with a Geographic Information
   System for obtaining detailed information on soil heterogeneity.},

Abstract = {The Calcium Carbide Gas Pressure (CCGP) method is a rapid measurement
   procedure for obtaining Soil Water Content (SWC), which relies on the
   chemical reaction of the calcium carbide reagent with water in soil
   pores. Currently, the method is limited to soil samples of 20 g or
   larger. However, test equipment for much smaller sample sizes does
   exist, and there is a need for quantifying the reliability of SWC
   measurements of small samples. The research involved a total of 232
   tests carried out on 22 different soil types containing particles no
   larger than No. 4 sieve size. The water content of soil specimens with
   varying wetness was measured using both conventional oven-drying and
   CCGP methods. The error distribution analysis indicated that the CCGP
   method, as used in this study, estimates the SWC for all soil types with
   a mean absolute discrepancy of around 0.3\% and 0.2\%, with general and
   soil specific calibrations, respectively. It was found that the CCGP
   method is reliable for SWC determination of small specimens up to 20\%
   of SWC if the manufacturer's instructions are followed. (C) 2014 Sharif

Year = {2018},
Volume = {77},

Abstract = {The expected increase in precipitation and temperature in Scandinavia,
   and especially short-time heavy precipitation, will increase the
   frequency of flooding. Urban areas are the most vulnerable, and
   specifically, the road infrastructure. The accumulation of large volumes
   of water and sediments on road-stream intersections gets severe
   consequences for the road drainage structures. This study integrates the
   spatial and temporal soil moisture properties into the research about
   flood prediction methods by a case study of two areas in Sweden, Vastra
   Gotaland and Varmland, which was affected by severe flooding in August
   2014. Soil moisture data are derived from remote-sensing techniques,
   with a focus on the soil moisture-specific satellites ASCAT and SMOS.
   Furthermore, several physical catchments descriptors (PCDs) are analyzed
   and the result shows that larger slopes and drainage density, in
   general, mean a higher risk of flooding. The precipitation is the same;
   however, it can be concluded that more precipitation in most cases gives
   higher soil moisture values. The lack, or the dimensioning, of road
   drainage structures seems to have a large impact on the flood risk as
   more sediment and water can be accumulated at the road-stream
   intersection. The results show that the method implementing soil
   moisture satellite data is promising for improving the reliability of
   flooding.},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil water content at high spatio-temporal resolution and
   coupled to other sensor data is crucial for applications oriented
   towards water sustainability in agriculture, such as precision

   at different depths, air and soil temperatures. The system is based on
   an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple
   integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency
   dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three
   non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 < 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves
   were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and
   normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the
   overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08
   for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data
   very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate
   very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63;
   RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically
   sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks.
   This work provides a framework for the replication and upgrading of a

   moisture. If the effects of surface roughness and vegetation on the
   reflected signals can be quantified, spaceborne GNSS bistatic radar
   receivers could provide soil moisture on relatively small spatial and

Abstract = {Surface soil moisture plays a key role in water and energy exchanges at
   the land-atmosphere interface. Previous research on the microwave remote
   sensing of soil moisture focused mostly on the forward modeling problem.
   This paper presents a unique inversion algorithm (Hong's algorithm) for
   soil moisture retrieval with reduced degrees of freedom of the Fresnel
   equation; the algorithm is based on the characteristics of the
   polarization ratio for rough surfaces around the Brewster angle and
   Hong's approximation, which is an approximate relationship between
   vertically and horizontally polarized reflectivities. Using the daily
   observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) taken at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees pixel,
   the soil moisture is estimated globally over the land surface using a
   relation between the complex dielectric constant and the soil moisture
   after retrieving the surface roughness and complex dielectric constant.
   The surface soil moisture products obtained from Hong's algorithm are
   validated using in situ observations carried out in Oklahoma and Georgia
   in 2003. The official AMSR-E soil moisture products are compared to
   assess Hong's algorithm using identical brightness temperature data
   sets. The biases and the root mean squared error calculated in
   comparison with the ground observations are in the range of -0.059
   m(3)/m(3) to 0.01 m(3)/m(3) and 0.023 m(3)/m(3) to 0.065 m(3)/m(3),
   respectively. Hong's algorithm estimates the soil moisture within the
   estimated accuracy of AMSR-E surface soil moisture, 0.06 m(3)/m(3),
   without requiring a priori information about the roughness and the
   dielectric constants of the surface. With a minimal use of forward
   models, this research could also be applied to global soil moisture
   retrieval in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite mission and
   the Soil Moisture Active/Passive mission. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In situ soil moisture measurements from 2007 to 2010 for 196 stations
   from five networks across the world (United States, France, Spain,
   China, and Australia) are used to determine the reliability of three
   soil moisture products: (i) a revised version of the ECMWF Interim
   Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim; ERA-Land); (ii) a revised version of the
   Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA)
   reanalysis from NASA (MERRA-Land); and (iii) a new, microwave-based
   multisatellite surface soil moisture dataset (SM-MW). Evaluation of the
   time series and anomalies from a moving monthly mean shows a good
   performance of the three products in capturing the annual cycle of
   surface soil moisture and its short-term variability. On average,
   correlations (95\% confidence interval) are 0.66 (+/- 0.038), 0.69 (+/-
   0.038), and 0.60 (+/- 0.061) for ERA-Land, MERRA-Land, and SM-MW. The
   two reanalysis products also capture the root-zone soil moisture well;
   on average, correlations are 0.68 (+/- 0.035) and 0.73 (+/- 0.032) for
   ERA-Land and MERRA-Land, respectively. Global trends analysis for
   1988-2010 suggests a decrease of surface soil moisture contents (72\% of
   significant trends are negative, i.e., drying) for ERA-Land and an
   increase in surface soil moisture (59\% of significant trends are
   positive, i.e., wetting) for MERRA-Land. As the spatial extent and
   fractions of significant trends in both products differ, the trend
   reflected in the majority of grid points within different climate
   classes was investigated and compared to that of SM-MW. The latter is
   dominated by negative significant trends (73.2\%) and is more in line
   with ERA-Land. For both reanalysis products, trends for the upper layer
   of soil are confirmed in the root-zone soil moisture (first meter of
   soil).},

Abstract = {The contributions of precipitation and soil moisture observations to
   soil moisture skill in a land data assimilation system are assessed.
   Relative to baseline estimates from the Modern Era
   Retrospective-analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA), the study
   investigates soil moisture skill derived from (i) model forcing
   corrections based on large-scale, gauge- and satellite-based
   precipitation observations and (ii) assimilation of surface soil
   moisture retrievals from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for
   Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Soil moisture skill (defined as the
   anomaly time series correlation coefficient R) is assessed using in situ
   observations in the continental United States at 37 single-profile sites
   within the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) for which skillful
   AMSR-E retrievals are available and at 4 USDA Agricultural Research
   Service ({''}Cal Val{''}) watersheds with high-quality distributed
   sensor networks that measure soil moisture at the scale of land model
   and satellite estimates. The average skill of AMSR-E retrievals is R =
   0.42 versus SCAN and R = 0.55 versus CalVal measurements. The skill of
   MERRA surface and root-zone soil moisture is R = 0.43 and R = 0.47,
   respectively, versus SCAN measurements. MERRA surface moisture skill is
   R = 0.56 versus CalVal measurements. Adding information from
   precipitation observations increases (surface and root zone) soil
   moisture skills by Delta R similar to 0.06. Assimilating AMSR-E
   retrievals increases soil moisture skills by Delta R similar to 0.08.
   Adding information from both sources increases soil moisture skills by
   Delta R similar to 0.13, which demonstrates that precipitation
   corrections and assimilation of satellite soil moisture retrievals
   contribute important and largely independent amounts of information.},

Abstract = {Land surface hydrology is an important control of surface weather and
   climate. A valuable technique to investigate this link is the
   prescription of soil moisture in land surface models, which leads to a
   decoupling of the atmosphere and land processes. Diverse approaches to
   prescribe soil moisture, as well as different prescribed soil moisture
   conditions have been used in previous studies. Here, we compare and
   assess four methodologies to prescribe soil moisture and investigate the
   impact of two different estimates of the climatological seasonal cycle
   used to prescribe soil moisture. Our analysis shows that, though in
   appearance similar, the different approaches require substantially
   different long-term moisture inputs and lead to different temperature
   signals. The smallest influence on temperature and the water balance is
   found when prescribing the median seasonal cycle of deep soil liquid
   water, whereas the strongest signal is found when prescribing soil
   liquid and soil ice using the mean seasonal cycle. These results
   indicate that induced net water-balance perturbations in experiments
   investigating soil moisture-climate coupling are important contributors
   to the climate response, in addition to the intended impact of the
   decoupling. These results help to guide the set-up of future experiments
   prescribing soil moisture, as for instance planned within the Land
   Surface, Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP).},

Abstract = {Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), a nondestructive
   analytical technique, may someday be used to rapidly and simultaneously
   quantify several soil properties in agricultural fields. The objectives
   of this study were to examine the influence of moisture content on the
   accuracy of NIRS analysis of soil properties and to assess the
   robustness of a NIRS multivariate calibration technique. Four hundred
   agricultural soil samples (< 2 mm) from Iowa and Minnesota were studied
   at two moisture levels: moist and air-dried. The soil properties tested
   included total C, organic C, inorganic C, total N, CEC, pH, texture,
   moisture, and potentially mineralizable N. About 70\% of the Iowa
   samples were selected for the calibration set, and the rest of the Iowa
   samples and all of the Minnesota samples were assigned to validation set
   I and validation set II, respectively. Calibrations were based on
   partial least-squares regression (PLSR), using the first differentials
   of log (1/R) for the 1100 to 2500-nm spectral range. The results for the
   calibration set and validation set I indicated that NIRS-PLSR was able
   to predict many soil properties (total C, organic C, inorganic C, total
   N, CEC, \% clay, and moisture) with reasonable accuracy for both the
   air-dried (R-2 > 0.76) and moist (R-2 > 0.74) soils. The results for
   validation set II showed that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict some
   properties of soils (total C, organic C, total N, and moisture content)
   from a different geographic region, but other soil properties in
   validation set II were not accurately predicted. Although NIRS-PLSR
   predictions are slightly more accurate for air-dried soils than for
   moist soils, the results indicate that the NIRS-PLSR technique can be
   used for analysis of field moist samples with acceptable accuracy as
   long as diverse soil samples from the same region are included in the
   calibration database.},

Abstract = {Dual probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensors are economical solutions for soil
   moisture measurements. However, in agriculture fields the temperature
   significantly changes from time to time during 24 h, which affects

   the error produced in the response of the DPHP sensors due to variation
   of the soil temperature. For this purpose, first effect of the soil
   temperature on the response of the sensor is studied using eight
   different soil samples. Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model,
   used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature
   compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and
   one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low
   power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also
   developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The
   developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured
   for 38 h at every 1 h interval. Field measurements indicates that
   volumetric moisture content measured without temperature compensation
   leads to error of about 3\% and with temperature compensation the error
   is reduced to 0.5\%. (C) 2017 Elsevier,B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The conventional methods frequently used in Cuba to determine some
   fertility parameters important for sugarcane production, such as organic
   matter (OM), available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K2O), are
   difficult, costly, and time-consuming procedures. This study was
   undertaken to build and validate Visible/Near Infrared Reflectance
   (Vis/NIR) calibration models of these parameters at landscape level and
   within a field, by taking into consideration their correlation
   coefficients with the OM. The parameters P and K2O, which are not
   spectrally active in the Vis/NIR range should be better predicted when
   are highly correlated with OM. Also, the wavelength intervals to
   simplify this methodology were selected. Samples were air-dried before
   scanning using a diode array spectrophotometer covering the wavelength
   range from 399 to 1697 nm. The regression models were built by using the
   linear multivariate regression method Partial Least Squares (PLS), and
   the nonlinear multivariate regression methods Support Vector Machines
   (SVM) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR). At landscape level the best
   correlations between soil spectra and OM (0.90 <= R-2 <= 0.93; 0.12 <=
   RMSEP <= 0.14) were obtained with LWR, followed by K2O with LWR (0.77 <=
   R-2 <= 0.79; 3.47 <= RMSEP <= 3.62), Olsen P (0.69 <= R-2 <= 0.81; 0.27
   <= RMSEP <= 0.35) and Oniani P (0.64 <= R-2 <= 0.65; 3.31 <= RMSEP <=
   3.61) both with SVM. Also the nonlinear regression models gave the best
   results within a field. The higher values for OM (R-2 = 0.92; RMSEP =
   0.14) and Olsen P (0.68 <= R-2 <= 0.83; 0.27 <= RMSEP <= 0.34) were
   observed with SVM, while for K2O (0.16 <= R-2 <= 0.63; 5.13 <= RMSEP <=
   5.88), and Oniani P (0.70 <= R-2 <= 0.72; 2.32 <= RMSEP <= 2.52) were
   obtained with LWR. The soil fertility parameters studied at landscape

   due to interference of two adjacent TDR probes},
Journal = {EXPERIMENTAL HEAT TRANSFER},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {30},
Number = {5},
Pages = {475-488},
Abstract = {The objective of this experimental study was to determine the
   measurement errors caused by the interference effects when two TDR
   probes operate nearby in various distance apart for different soil types
   and soil water contents. The results will help to guide the design of an
   experimental apparatus which aims to study the coupled heat and moisture
   transfer in soils at high temperatures of higher than 40 degrees C with
   the highest possible spatial resolution. The interference effect between
   two adjacent time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes has been evaluated
   and analyzed experimentally. It was observed that the distance between
   the probes, soil texture, and the water content of the testing soil is
   the key parameters which affect the interference and TDR probe
   capability of measurement. In this study, three types of soils were
   examined, namely FSJ\#1 (silty clay), Matilda (loamy sand), and Ottawa
   sand C-190 (quartz sand). Three different volumetric water contents were
   evaluated for each soil. The interference effect was noticeable in all
   soil samples when the distances between the probes were 1 cm. For the
   samples with higher moisture content, the effect of interference on the
   TDRs' electromagnetic waveform signals is more prominent. Interference
   was found in Matilda samples with degrees of saturations of 0.5 and
   higher even though the distances between the probes were greater than 1
   cm; nevertheless, the determination of volumetric water content was not
   affected by the interference, because the interference only caused the
   two TDRs' electromagnetic waveform signals to shift by the same length.
   No interference was observed in cases of FSJ\#1 and Ottawa sand when the
   distances between the probes were greater than 1 cm. From the results,
   it was found that the sensitivity zone of our TDR equipment is a radius
   of about 10 mm surrounding the central needle of the TDR probe. In case
   of FSJ\#1, when interference occurs, the measurement error of water
   content significantly increases from 9.3\% to 15.5\%, corresponding to
   the degree of saturation from 0.25 to 1.0.},

Abstract = {Between 2009 and 2011, the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) was
   augmented with soil moisture/soil temperature probes and atmospheric
   relative humidity instruments as part of a programmatic expansion in
   support of the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS).
   The 114 sites in this sparse network are well distributed across the

   unchanged in land use for many decades into the future. Soil probes are
   installed in triplicate redundancy, similar to the air temperature and
   precipitation measurements, at either five standard World Meteorological
   Organization (WMO) depths (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm) or only two depths
   (5 and 10 cm) depending on the nature of the underlying materials.
   Stations also measure air temperature, surface skin temperature,
   precipitation, solar radiation, and 1.5-m wind speed. In addition to
   sensor failure, the triplicate design of USCRN soil probes have allowed
   for an initial characterization of variability of soil moisture
   measurements. Nationwide analysis of soil moisture during early-to-mid
   growing season in 2011 and 2012 was performed to examine the differences
   in response to the widespread drought of 2012. The redundancy of the
   network helps retain the continuity of the record over time, and also
   provides key insights into the variations of measurements at a single
   location that are related to a combination of installation effects and
   the impacts of soil differences at the local level. This article
   highlights the usefulness of deploying triplicate configurations of soil
   probes for detecting faulty sensors and for better understanding the
   nature of soil moisture measurement variability.},

Title = {Evaluation of the Performance of TDR and Capacitance Techniques for Soil
   Moisture Measurement},
Journal = {GEOTECHNICAL TESTING JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {41},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {Though researchers have employed various techniques (gravimetric,
   electromagnetic, neutron scattering, heat pulse, microwave, and optical
   remote sensing techniques) for soil moisture measurement,
   dielectric-based techniques (Time Domain Reflectometry {[}TDR] and
   capacitance technique {[}CT]) have gained much more popularity, mainly
   due to revolutionary developments in the fields of electronics and data
   communication systems. However, the suitability and relative performance
   of these techniques for moisture measurement of soils is a point of
   debate. Hence, in order to address this issue, extensive studies were
   conducted on soils of entirely different characteristics, compacted at
   various compaction states (dry densities and water contents) by
   employing TDR and capacitance probes. Subsequently, the dielectric
   constant of the soil and its bulk electrical conductivity were obtained
   using these probes and compared against each other and those computed
   from Topp's equation, which is a well-established relationship between
   the dielectric constant of the soil and its volumetric moisture content.
   An attempt was also made to correlate Ka values obtained from the
   dielectric techniques and Topp's equation with those of the Time
   Propagation (TP) Mixing model, which incorporates the properties of the
   soil matrix as well. It has been observed that the Ka-TDR matches well
   with the Ka-Topp and Ka-TP, while the best match has been observed
   between Ka-TDR and Ka-Topp as compared to the Ka-CT. As such, the study
   demonstrates clearly that Topp's equation, which ignores the
   soil-specific parameters, is capable of determining the soil moisture
   content appropriately. This study proposes an empirical equation that
   relates dielectric constants obtained from Topp's equation to those
   obtained from TDR, CT, and the TP Mixing model. Such a relationship can
   be further utilized for estimating the volumetric soil moisture content.},

   Measurement and Prediction},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2018},

Number = {1},
Month = {JUL 5},
Abstract = {Using 6 yr (Water Year {[}WY] 2009-WY 2014) of hourly in situ
   measurements from a spatially distributed water-balance cluster, we
   quantified the long-term accuracy of an algorithm used to predict
   spatial patterns of depth-integrated soil-water storage within the
   rain-snow transition zone of the southern Sierra Nevada. The
   algorithm-the multivariate, non-parametric regression-tree estimator
   Random Forest-was used to predict soil-water storage based on a
   combination of attributes at each instrument cluster (soil texture,
   topographic wetness index, elevation, northness, and canopy cover).
   Out-of-bag R-2 (similar to cross-validation for Random Forest) was used
   to quantify the accuracy of the estimator for unobserved data. Accuracy
   was consistently high during the wet-up, snow-cover, and early recession
   periods of average and wet years. The accuracy declined at the end of a
   3-yr dry period, and the relative rank of the independent variables in
   the model shifted. Soil texture was the highest-ranked independent
   variable across all years, followed by elevation and northness.
   Topographic wetness increased in importance during dry periods.
   Northness exhibited high importance during the wet-up and early
   recession periods of most water years. During dry years, the importance
   of elevation declined. In dry years, notable differences in soil-water
   storage at each depth include lower-than-average storage in the deeper
   regolith at the beginning of the water year and lower storage in
   near-surface layers during the winter resulting from transient snow
   cover.},

   higher data dispersion than undisturbed samples, due to factors such as
   grain size and bulk density, which influence the calibration data. The
   CS616 sensor had satisfactory performance in the calibration of
   disturbed and undisturbed samples, with excellent fit of the soil
   moisture data. Using soil moisture contents obtained by the CS616

   moisture and snow estimation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {216},
Pages = {13-27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Global monitoring of soil moisture and snow is now available through
   various satellite observations from optical, microwave, and
   gravitational sensors. However, very few modeling frameworks exist that
   conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically
   consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of
   multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the
   Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models
   with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic
   Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to
   estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness
   temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage
   observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE),
   respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4)
   reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states
   and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data
   assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for
   2003-2009 to investigate individual contributions from different
   satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of
   open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of
   MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and
   high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness
   temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture
   and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil
   moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth
   estimation in most high-latitude regions. Generally, the combination of
   MODIS, GRACE, and AMSR-E observations with regard to spatial locations
   holds promise to provide a robust global soil moisture and snow
   estimation through the multi-sensor land data assimilation system.},

Volume = {183},
Number = {SI},

Abstract = {Frequency Domain Analysis can be used to determine the moisture content
   of soils. At least two techniques can be used, the first using the soil
   capacitance as part of a low pass filter, measuring the attenuation of a
   fixed frequency signal, the second using the soil capacitance as the
   controlling component in a variable frequency oscillator. Whilst the two
   techniques demonstrate differing sensitivities to different conditions,
   they demonstrate an acceptably stable reciprocal relationship to each
   other over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. With insulated
   probes, it is possible under field conditions for these probes to be
   damaged or for moisture to creep into the electronics housing. Either of
   these conditions make the soil capacitor appear to `leak' by providing a
   lower electrically resistive path in parallel with the soil capacitance.
   This resistance affects the measurements of the two techniques described
   above in different ways and thus readings from the sensors diverge from
   their normal relationships. These variations are measureable and thus
   the fault condition can be automatically detected. This can be used to
   flag potential problems in the soil moisture measurements raising an
   alarm condition, or stopping unnecessary irrigation based on erroneous
   results from a damaged sensor. This paper presents results demonstrating
   these phenomena using a Frequency Domain capacitance based sensor

Journal = {PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {28-38},

Abstract = {To quantitatively analyze the spatial features of a cosmic-ray sensor
   (CRS) (i.e., the measurement support volume of the CRS and the weight of
   the in situ point-scale soil water content (SWC) in terms of the
   regionally averaged SWC derived from the CRS) in measuring the SWC,
   cooperative observations based on CRS, oven drying and frequency domain
   reflectometry (FDR) methods are performed at the point and regional
   scales in a desert steppe area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
   This region is flat with sparse vegetation cover consisting of only
   grass, thereby minimizing the effects of terrain and vegetation.
   Considering the two possibilities of the measurement support volume of
   the CRS, the results of four weighting methods are compared with the SWC
   monitored by FDR within an appropriate measurement support volume. The
   weighted average calculated using the neutron intensity-based weighting
   method (Ni weighting method) best fits the regionally averaged SWC
   measured by the CRS. Therefore, we conclude that the gyroscopic support
   volume and the weights determined by the Ni weighting method are the
   closest to the actual spatial features of the CRS when measuring the
   SWC. Based on these findings, a scale transformation model of the SWC
   from the point scale to the scale of the CRS measurement support volume
   is established. In addition, the spatial features simulated using the Ni
   weighting method are visualized by developing a software system.},

Title = {Real-Time Soil Moisture and Salinity Profile Estimation Using
   Assimilation of Embedded Sensor Datastreams},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Treated urban wastewater has been increasingly used for irrigation to
   increase crop production, but inadequate management of this marginal
   quality saline water cannot only reduce crop yield but also degrade
   soil. To increase sustainability, a sound irrigation policy based on
   real-time soil states is needed to avoid the adverse effects from excess
   salinity in soils. In real applications, uncertain model inputs and soil
   heterogeneity are expected when a modeling approach is used. In
   addition, sensor measurement information is generally insufficient to
   characterize the state of the soil profile in detail. To overcome these
   limitations, a monitoring and modeling system assimilating embedded
   sensor datastreams into a hydrologic model to improve real-time soil
   state estimates over the whole profile of interest is examined with a
   wastewater reuse system in Palmdale, CA. Experimental results show that
   under an unknown heterogeneous soil, the filtering scheme is able to
   describe the spatial variability of moisture and soil solution
   electrical conductivity in soils due to direct state estimation by
   assimilating moisture and electrical conductivity measurements and also
   due to improved soil hydraulic parameter estimates through the data
   assimilation framework. Two data withholding validation experiments were
   conducted to evaluate the added value of assimilating measurements. The
   spatial data withholding experiment demonstrates that state predictions
   at unobserved areas can be improved via the assimilation if the soil
   system is relatively homogeneous and effects from erroneous irrigation
   forcing are reduced. The temporal data withholding experiment indicates
   that a high update frequency can maintain the reliability of state
   estimation. Overall, this system can provide a more accurate soil
   characterization that could be used to optimize irrigation management to
   reduce adverse effects from wastewater reuse.},

Abstract = {This paper discusses soil moisture retrievals over the Tibetan Plateau
   from brightness temperature (T-B's) observed by the Special Sensor
   Microwave Imagers (SSM/I's) during the warm seasons of the period from
   July 1987 to December 2008. The Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR)
   of F08, F11 and F13 SSM/I satellites by the Precipitation Research Group
   of Colorado State University is used for this study. A soil moisture
   retrieval algorithm is developed based on a radiative transfer model
   that simulates top-of-atmosphere T-B's whereby effects of atmosphere are
   calculated from near-surface forcings obtained from a bias-corrected
   dataset. Validation of SSM/I retrievals against in situ measurements for
   a two-and-half year period (225 matchups) gives a Root Mean Squared
   Error of 0.046m(3) m(-3). The agreement between retrievals and Noah
   simulations from the Global Land Data Assimilation System is
   investigated to further provide confidence in the reliability of SSM/I
   retrievals at the Plateau-scale.
   Normalised soil moisture anomalies (N) are computed on a warm seasonal
   (May-October) and on a monthly basis to analyse the trends present
   within the products available from July 1987 to December 2008. The slope
   of linear regression functions between N and time is used to quantify
   the trends. Both the warm season and monthly N indicate severe wettings
   of 0.8 to almost 1.6 decade(-1) in the centre of the Plateau.
   Correlations are found by the trend with elevation for the warm season
   as a whole and the individual months May, September and October. The
   observed wetting of the Tibetan Plateau agrees with recent findings on
   permafrost retreat, precipitation increase and potential
   evapotranspiration decline.},

Abstract = {A real-time soil nutrient sensor would allow efficient collection of
   data with a fine spatial resolution to accurately characterize within
   field variability for site-specific nutrient application. Ion-selective
   electrodes are promising candidates because they have rapid response,
   directly measure the analyte, and are small and portable. Our goal was
   to investigate the ability of three different phosphate ion-selective
   electrodes (two fabricated with organotin compound-based PVC membranes,
   and one fabricated from a cobalt rod) used in conjunction with Kelowna
   soil extractant to determine phosphorus over the typical range of soil
   concentrations. Electrodes using organotin compound-based PVC membranes
   containing bis(p-chlorobenzyl)tin dichloride as an ionophore exhibited
   sensitive responses to HPO42- over a range of 10(-4) to 10(-1) mol/L in
   Tris buffer at pH 7. They were nearly insensitive to phosphate when
   using Kelowna soil extractant as the base solution, perhaps because of
   the high concentration of fluoride (0.015 mol/L) in the Kelowna
   solution. In addition, the life of the membranes was less than 14 days.
   Electrodes using another tin-compound-based PVC membrane containing
   tributyltin chloride as an ionophore also provided unsatisfactory
   results, showing much less sensitivity to H2PO4- than previously
   reported. The cobalt rod-based electrodes exhibited sensitive responses
   to H2PO4- over a range from 10(-5) to 10(-1) mol/L total phosphate
   concentration with a detection limit of 10(-5) mol/L in the Kelowna
   solution. This detection range would encompass the typical range of soil
   phosphorus concentrations measured in agricultural fields. The
   selectivity of the cobalt electrodes was satisfactory for measuring
   phosphates in the presence of each of six interfering ions, i.e., HCO3-,
   Cl-, Br-, NO3-, Ac-, and F-, with the electrodes being 47 to 1072 times
   more responsive to phosphate than to the tested interfering ions.},

Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {93-103},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Microdialysis is a technique that can be used to sample fluxes of
   nitrogen (N) in soils with minimal disturbance. To advance our
   understanding of the technique and improve N recovery, we compared a
   common membrane type (10 x 0:5 mm probe length and width, 20 kDa
   molecular weight cut-off; MWCO) with alternative length and MWCO
   configurations (30 mm; and 100 kDa MWCO). We hypothesised that the
   alternative membranes would improve recovery of low molecular weight N
   via increased surface area and membrane pore size. The test
   environments, sampled at fixed pump flow rates, were: (i) stirred 100 mu
   M N standard solution containing organic (amino acid) and inorganic
   (ammonium, nitrate) N; (ii) soil spiked with 100 mu M standard N
   solution; and (iii) in situ boreal forest soil. In general, long
   membranes recovered more N, but the magnitude of improved recovery
   varied with test environment. Long membranes recovered more inorganic N
   regardless of flow rate, except ammonium in stirred solution, where
   length had no effect at slow flow rates. Long membranes also recovered
   more organic N from stirred solution regardless of flow rate, and
   recovered most N at slow flow rates in spiked soil. Longer membranes
   recovered more amino acids in situ in forest soil, with improved
   resolution of individual amino acids, but were biased towards soluble,
   mobile forms. MWCO did not affect N recoveries, indicating that in the
   test conditions, membrane length had greater control than pore size. We
   discuss the bottlenecks of microdialysis application in soil research
   and conclude that optimised membrane configurations will advance its use
   as a tool for quantifying nutrient fluxes in soils. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {This study evaluated the family of ECH2O sensors (EC-5 and ECH2O-TE) for
   measurement of soil moisture content (theta), bulk electrical
   conductivity (ECb) and temperature for a range of soils, across a range
   of measurement frequencies between 5 and 150 MHz. Measurement frequency
   is one of the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of capacitance
   sensor measurements to soil variables such as soil texture, electrical
   conductivity, and temperature. Measurements in both soil and solution
   demonstrated that the ECH2O EC and TE measurements were accurate. Using
   a measurement frequency of 70 MHz, a single calibration curve was
   determined for a range of mineral soils, independent of soil salinity,
   suggesting there might be no need for a soil specific calibration. When
   combining all data for each soil type, the R-2 values remained high (R-2
   = 0.98) with little probe to probe variability. After laboratory
   calibration, the error for theta was about 2\%, independent of soil ECb,
   up to a soil solution EC of about 12 dS/m. Our results showed that a
   single calibration curve could be used for all tested mineral soils,
   independent of soil salinity. The bulk soil ECb - water content data
   were excellently described by a polynomial expression. Measurements of
   temperature sensitivity to soil water content and ECb were sufficiently
   small. For example, for a temperature change of 10 degrees C,
   measurements of theta and ECb were affected by about 0.02 cm(3) cm(-3)
   and 0.02 dS/m, respectively. Limited sensor calibration requirements are
   important, when large networks of soil moisture sensors are being
   deployed. It is concluded that an accurate, cost-effective soil moisture
   sensor is available that operates at a measurement frequency of 70 MHz,
   with a low sensitivity to confounding soil environmental factors. (C)

Title = {Evaluating and Classifying Field-Scale Soil Nutrient Status in Beijing
   using 3S Technology},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Pages = {689-696},
Abstract = {More attention has been paid to estimating soil nutrient status, along
   with a sharp decrease in total farmland acreage, especially in Beijing
   Municipality. However, traditional site-specific investigation makes it
   impossible to apply it to large scale monitoring. The objective of this
   study was to evaluate and classify soil nutrient status using advanced
   3S (global positioning system, GPS; remote sensing, RS; and geographic
   information system, GIS) technology. Firstly, multi-temporal Landsat TM
   5 images with 30 m spatial resolution were utilized to identify the
   field-scale farmlands. The overall classification accuracy reached
   86.96\%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.743. Additionally, the
   correlation coefficient (r) reached 0.942 by comparing the remote
   sensing-based farmland area with the statistical data. Subsequently,
   organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available
   potassium from 7,435 field sample points positioned by GPS receiver,
   were used to generate a comprehensive soil nutrient index in GIS
   software, according to the classification criteria of Beijing Soil and
   Fertilizer Workshop. Finally, a classification map of field-scale soil
   nutrient levels (very high, high, moderate, low \& very low) was created
   using the farmlands as mask layers. The analysis results showed that the
   soils at moderate and low levels dominated the Beijing's farmlands,
   which accounted for 46.1\% and 39.1\%, respectively; high and very low
   level soils were the second place whose ratios were 10.4\% and 4.3\%,
   respectively; and very high level soils could be rarely found. Yanqing
   County, Tongzhou District and Changping District have better soil
   nutrient status as a whole. (C) 2012 Friends Science Publishers},

   The SOC was reduced due to 75 percent NPK at the first depth. In cocoa,
   the P availability increased significantly with application of VCE at 20

Title = {Development of on-line measurement system of bulk density based on
   on-line measured draught, depth and soil moisture content},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {86},
Number = {2},
Pages = {218-229},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {On-line measurement of soil compaction is needed for site specific
   tillage management. The soil bulk density (rho) indicating soil
   compaction was measured on-line by means of a developed compaction
   sensor system that comprised several sensors for on-line measurement of
   the draught (D) of a soil cutting tool (subsoiler), the soil cutting
   depth (d) and the soil moisture content (w). The subsoiler D was
   measured with a single shear beam load cell, whereas d was measured with
   a wheel gauge that consisted of a swinging arm metal wheel and a linear
   variable differential transducer (LVDT). The soil w was measured with a
   near infrared fibre-type spectrophotometer sensor. These on-line three
   measured parameters were used to calculate p, by utilising a hybrid
   numerical-statistical mathematical model developed in a previous study.
   Punctual kriging was performed using the variogram estimation and
   spatial prediction with error (VESPER) 1.6 software to develop the field
   maps of rho, soil w, subsoiler d and D, based on 10 m x 10 m grid. To
   verify the on-line measured rho map, this map was compared with the map
   measured by the conventional core sampling method.
   The spherical semivariogram models, providing the best fit for all
   properties was used for kriging of different maps. Maps developed showed
   that no clear correlation could be detected between different parameters
   measured and subsoiler D. However, the D value was smaller at shallow
   penetration d, whereas large D coincided with large rho values at few
   positions in the field. Maps of rho measured with the core sampling and
   on-line methods were similar, with correlation coefficient (r) and the
   standard error values of 0.75 and 0.054 Mg m(-3), respectively. On-line
   measured rho exhibited larger errors at very dry zones. The normal
   distribution of the rho error between the two different measurement
   methods showed that about 72\% of the errors were less than 0.05 Mg
   m(-3) in absolute values. However, the overall mean error of on-line
   measured rho was of a small value of 2.3\%, which ensures the method
   accuracy for on-line measurement of p. Measurement under very dry
   conditions should be minimised, because it can lead to a relatively
   large error, and hence, compacted zones at dry zones cannot be detected
   correctly. (C) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In order to introduce a sustainable soil fertility system for chickpea,
   field experiments were carried out in 2007 and 2008 growing seasons.
   Experiments were arranged in split-split plot arrangements with three
   replications. Main plots consisted of (G(1)): establishing a mixed
   vegetation of vetch and barley, (G(2)): without green manure. Also, five
   strategies for obtaining the base fertilizer requirement including
   (N-1): farm manure; (N-2): compost; (N-3): triple super phosphate;
   (N-4): farm manure + compost and (N-5): farm manure + compost + triple
   super phosphate. Four levels of biofertilizers consisted of (B-1):
   Phosphate solubilizing bacteria; (B-2): Trichoderma harzianum; (B-3):
   Phosphate solubilizing bacteria + T. harzianum; and (B-4): without
   biofertilizers were arranged in sub-sub plots. Results showed that green
   manure increased pod number and number of fertile pods per plant.
   Integrating biofertilizers (B-3) and green manure (G(1)) produced the
   highest pod number per plant and grain yield. The highest amounts of
   yield and yield components were obtained in G(1)N(5) treatment.
   Comparison of 3-way interactions showed that G(1)N(5)B(3) was the best
   treatment. Significant increase of N, P, K, Fe and Mg content in leaves
   and grains emphasized on superiority of mentioned treatment because each
   one of these nutrients has an approved role in chlorophyll synthesis and
   photosynthesis ability of the crop. The N-5 treatment in addition to
   having the highest yield had the best grain quality due to high protein,
   starch and total sugar contents, low crude fiber and reduced cooking

Abstract = {In this study, the microclimate changes in silvopastoral systems are
   quantified at different time and spatial scales and compared with
   single-pasture systems. The study was conducted in a silvopastoral
   system in Sao Carlos, Brazil (22 degrees 01' South and 47 degrees 53'
   West). The silvopastoral system consisted of grass pastures {[}Urochloa
   (sin. Brachiaria) decumbens cv. Basilik] lined with strips of native
   trees spaced at 17 m. Continuous microclimate measurements (air
   temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and incident
   photosynthetically active radiation) were carried out from September
   2010 to September 2012 at two positions of the silvopastoral system (2.0
   and 8.5 m from the rows of trees) and at a pasture under full sunlight,
   located in an adjacent area. The soil moisture was monitored weekly from
   24 March 2010 to 1 April 2012 at distances of 0.0, 2.0, 4.75, and 8.5 m
   from the rows of trees. The rows of native trees reduced wind speeds
   (46\% reduction) and changed the photosynthetically active radiation
   incidence pattern on the pasture (up to 40\% reduction of incidence at
   the point nearest to the trees). The combined action of these factors
   promoted thermal and air humidity changes on the pasture at the
   different points measured. With respect to soil moisture, there was
   greater soil moisture removal at the sampling points near the rows of
   native trees under the silvopastoral system, mainly due to enhanced
   exploration by tree roots at greater depths in dry spells or early dry
   periods, when compared with the midpoints between the rows.},

Abstract = {The Restinga vegetation consists of a mosaic of plant communities, which
   are defined by the characteristics of the substrates, resulting from the
   type and age of the depositional processes. This mosaic complex of
   vegetation types comprises restinga forest in advanced (high restinga)
   and medium regeneration stages (low restinga), each with particular
   differentiating vegetation characteristics. The climate along the coast
   is tropical (Koppen). Of all ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest, Restinga
   is the most fragile and susceptible to anthropic disturbances. Plants
   respond to soil characteristics with physiological and morphological
   modifications, resulting in changes in the architecture (spatial
   configuration) of the root system. The purpose of this study was to
   characterize the soil fertility of high and low restinga forests, by
   chemical and physical parameters, and its relation to the root system
   distribution in the soil profile. Four locations were studied: (1) Ilha
   Anchieta State Park, Ubatuba; (2) two Ecological Stations of
   Jureia-Itatins and of Chauas, in the municipality of Iguape; (3) Vila de
   Pedrinhas in the municipality of llha Comprida; and (4) Ilha do Cardoso
   State Park, Cananeia. The soil fertility (chemical and physical
   properties) was analyzed in the layers 0-5, 0-10, 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60
   cm. In addition, the distribution of the root system in the soil profile
   was evaluated, using digital images and the Spring program. It was
   concluded that the root system of all vegetation types studied is
   restricted to the surface layers, 0-10 and 10-20 cm, but occupies mainly
   the 0-10 cm layer (70 \%); that soil fertility is low in all
   environments studied, with base saturation values below 16 \%, since
   most exchange sites are occupied by aluminum; and that restinga
   vegetation is edaphic.},

Abstract = {A confluence of scientific and technological developments in geospatial
   data have made it possible to para-meterise the components of the soil
   water balance equation in space and time at spatial and temporal
   resolutions useful for agriculture. In this work, we present results on
   the development of an approach that takes advantage of this opportunity
   to predict soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 90 m on a daily time
   step at multiple depths in the profile.
   Three types of water balance model were examined: (i) single layer model
   with saturated flow (ii) multi-layer model with saturated flow and (iii)
   multi-layer model with unsaturated flow. Five layers were considered:
   0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm, which coincide with the layers
   of the Soil Landscape Grid of Australia which is available at similar to
   90 m spatial resolution. Pedotransfer functions were used to predict the
   bucket size for each soil layer. Precipitation and evapotranspiration
   are estimated by gridded SILO precipitation data (5 km, 1 day) and the
   MODIS 16 ET product (1 km, 8 day), respectively. Soil moisture
   predictions were tested against four publicly and privately owned soil
   moisture networks.
   The multi-layer model incorporating unsaturated flow performed the best
   in terms of predicting soil moisture for the whole profile (0-1 m) with
   a median correlation coefficient (r) of just over 0.7 across all sites.
   When classifying the sites according to the land use; cropping sites
   showed better median correlation (similar to 0.8) than grazing sites
   (similar to 0.7). However, grazing sites seem to have more consistent
   results for all the layers. To understand the relative importance of the
   water balance model predictions as compared to other environmental
   properties, a Random Forest model was fitted to a suite of variables
   e.g. soil order, month, temperature and etc., that vary in space, time
   or both space and time. For the analysis, only calibrated soil moisture
   network sites (OzNet) were considered. Soil moisture which was derived
   from unsaturated soil water balance model was the 9th most important
   variable. To assess the quality of the predictive model,
   leave-one-out-site cross validation (LOOSCV) was performed and across
   all sites the prediction quality was reasonable (Concordance = 0.66,
   Accuracy = 0.06 cm 3 cm(-3)). These results highlight the potential of
   this approach and since it is based on readily available data it is
   scalable to large spatial domains.},

   moisture sensors placed in the area covered by the system were collected
   by a central unit using radio transmission. The soil moisture was
   estimated via an artificial neural network with the data obtained for
   micro-regions. Next, the locations of the moisture sensors in the area
   were optimized using a genetic algorithm to provide the optimum energy
   and water consumption in the system. Subsequently, the drip irrigation
   was controlled using moisture data from only five sensors located at the
   best points, as determined by the genetic algorithm. The obtained
   experimental results indicated that the moisture rate at the end of the
   period of irrigation using the system developed was more homogeneous
   than that of traditional irrigation systems for each micro-region using
   only five soil moisture sensors in a non-homogeneous area. Thus, daily
   energy and water consumption were decreased by 32 \%, while the moisture
   rate in the soil was maintained within the desired range.},

Abstract = {We develop the stabilized extended boundary condition method (SEBCM)
   based on the classical EBCM to solve the 3-D vector electromagnetic
   scattering problem from arbitrary random rough surfaces. Similar to the
   classical EBCM, we expand the fields in terms of Floquet modes and match
   the extended boundary conditions at test surfaces away from the actual
   rough surface to retrieve the surface currents and therefore the
   scattered fields. However, to solve long-standing stability problems of
   the classical EBCM, we introduce a z-coordinate transformation to
   restrict and control the test surface locations explicitly. We also
   introduce the concepts of moderated test surface locations and balanced
   k-charts for further stabilization and optimization of the solutions.
   The computational efficiency is optimized by judicious submatrix
   decomposition. The resulting bistatic scattering cross sections are
   validated by comparing with analytical and numerical solutions.
   Specifically, the solutions are compared with those from the small
   perturbation method and small-slope approximation within their validity
   region, and with those from the method of moments outside the validity
   domains of analytical solutions. It is shown that SEBCM gives accurate,
   numerically efficient, full-wave solutions over a large range of surface
   roughnesses and medium losses, which are far beyond the validity range
   of analytical methods. These properties are expected to make SEBCM a
   competitive forward solver for soil moisture retrieval from radar
   measurements.},

Abstract = {At the hillslope scale, surface runoff depends to a great extent on the
   water deficit of the soils, i.e. the difference between the effective
   porosity and the water content, all through the soil profile. The aim of
   this study was to assess water deficits using Electrical Resistivity
   Tomography (ERT). ERT offers several advantages: (i) it is not
   intrusive, (ii) it exhibits spatial patterns at a decametric or
   hectometric scale, and (iii) it provides information on both water
   content and soil depth. The study was conducted on a Mediterranean
   shaley sandy soil, in the Cevennes (South of France), First, the factors
   (nature of the pores and organization of the material, water content,
   soil solution and temperature) on which electrical resistivities depend
   were analyzed in the laboratory. Soil samples were used to derive the W
   and W parameters of Archie's relation, changes in the soil solution over
   time, and the effect of temperature on resistivities. These results were
   then used to interpret ERT in situ at different times of the year. The
   water content and water deficit obtained from ERT were then compared
   with local measurements made using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and
   the comparison was satisfactory. The results of this study show the
   potential of measuring soil water content and water deficit using
   electrical resistivities, and describe how uncertainties in temperature,
   porosity, and fluid conductivity impact ERT-obtained estimates of soil
   water content and deficit. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Spaceborne radiometers operating near 1.4 GHz are the primary instrument
   for recent efforts to remotely sense near-surface soil moisture around
   the globe. Generally, these instruments must contend with the effects of
   vegetation growing in the soil. However, an important first step is to
   model the measurements made by a radiometer that is viewing bare
   (vegetation-free) soil. The proposed model uses a matching layer and a
   random depolarizer to describe bare soil surface roughness and some
   aspects of antenna beamwidth. The model suggests that the effects of
   near-surface soil moisture and roughness upon the radiometer measurement
   are more distinct than is currently thought. Furthermore, it appears
   that both moisture and roughness can be retrieved from a single set of
   radiometer measurements made at orthogonal linear polarizations. This
   retrieval precision is predicted to be poor at soil observation angles
   near nadir but improves for larger angles. At observation angles near 50
   degrees, the vertically polarized radiometer measurements are predicted
   to be nearly insensitive to roughness. A convenient parameterization of
   the model is provided and permits quick implementation.},

Abstract = {A study was carried out to investigate the utility of L-band SAR data
   for estimating aboveground biomass in sites with low levels of
   vegetation regrowth. Data to estimate biomass were collected from 59
   sites located in fire-disturbed black spruce forests in interior Alaska.
   PALSAR L-band data (HH and HV polarizations) collected on two dates in
   the summer/fall of 2007 and one date in the summer of 2009 were used.
   Significant linear correlations were found between the log of
   aboveground biomass (range of 0.02 to 22.2 t ha(-1)) and sigma degrees
   (L-HH) and sigma degrees (L-HV) for the data collected on each of the
   three dates, with the highest correlation found using the L-HV data
   collected when soil moisture was highest. Soil moisture, however, did
   change the correlations between L-band sigma degrees and aboveground
   biomass, and the analyses suggest that the influence of soil moisture is
   biomass dependent. The results indicate that to use L-band SAR data for
   mapping aboveground biomass and monitoring forest regrowth will require
   development of approaches to account for the influence that variations
   in soil moisture have on L-band microwave backscatter, which can be
   particularly strong when low levels of aboveground biomass occur. (C)

Abstract = {Establishing a representative monitoring location of soil water content
   is important for agricultural water mana-gement. One of the challenges
   is to develop a field protocol for determining such a location with
   minimum costs. In this paper, we use the concept of time stability in
   soil water content to exami-ne whether using a short term monitoring
   period is sufficient to identify a representative site of soil water
   content and, therefore, irrigation scheduling. Surface moisture-density
   gauge was used as a means for measuring soil water content. Variations
   of soil water content in space and time were studied using
   geostatistical tools. Measuring soil water content was made at 30
   locations as nodes of a 6x8 m grid, six times during the growing season.
   A representative location for average soil water content estimation was
   allocated at the beginning of a season, and thereafter it was validated.
   Results indicated that the spatial pattern of soil water content was
   strongly temporally stable, explained by the relationship between soil
   water content and fine soil texture. Two field surveys of soil water
   content, conducted before and after the 1st irrigation, could be
   sufficient to allocate a representative location of soil water content,
   and for adequate irrigation scheduling of the whole field. Surface
   moisture-density gauge was found to be efficient for characterising time
   stability of soil water content under irrigated field conditions.},

Title = {L-band remote-sensing increases sampled levels of global soil
   moisture-air temperature coupling strength},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {220},
Pages = {51-58},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Due to their shallow penetration of the soil column, remote-sensing (RS)
   soil moisture retrievals are often considered ill-suited for measuring
   the strength of soil moisture-air temperature coupling. Consequently,
   soil moisture proxies derived from antecedent rainfall considerations
   are commonly applied in their place. However, the suitably of satellite
   RS products has not yet been examined for newer soil moisture products
   derived from L-band microwave radiometry. This study globally compares
   correlations between monthly soil moisture and the monthly number of
   summertime hot days (NHD) for the case of three separate RS-based soil
   moisture products and a fourth soil moisture proxy derived from the
   standard precipitation index (SPI). Compared with SPI-based estimates,
   C- and X-band RS soil moisture products demonstrate a significantly (at
   p = 0.05 {[}-] confidence) weaker correlation with NHD. However,
   2010-2018 L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) based soil
   moisture-NHD correlation is generally comparable to the SPI case.
   Furthermore, utilizing higher-precision 2015-2018 soil moisture products
   from the L-band Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission further
   strengthens soil moisture-NHD correlation and leads to stronger sampled
   correlations than SPI over global hot spot regions (significant at p =
   0.05 {[}-] confidence). Combined with the general equivalence of monthly
   surface and root zone soil moisture anomalies, these results suggest
   that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, i.e. the relative size of soil
   moisture signal and random observation error variances) of RS-based
   surface soil moisture product, instead of their vertical measurement
   depth, is the key limiting factor determining their ability to quantify
   land atmosphere coupling strengths. Based on this, we argue that L-band
   soil moisture products have reached a sufficient level of SNR to be of
   value for the study of land-atmosphere coupling.},

Abstract = {Northeast China (NEC) has become one of China's most obvious examples of

   spatiotemporal dynamics of SSM in NEC using a 32-year SSM product and
   found the following. (1) SSM displayed the characteristics of being dry
   in the west and wet in the east and decreased with time. (2) The
   seasonal difference was found for the temporal dynamics of SSM: it
   increased in summer and decreased in spring and autumn. (3) For all four
   regions studied, the temporal dynamics of SSM were similar to those of
   the whole of NEC, but with different rates of SSM change. Moreover, SSM
   in regions B and D had a lower spatial variance than the other two
   regions because of the stable spatial pattern of cropland. (4) The
   change rates for SSM were consistent with that observed for the warming
   rates, which indicated that SSM levels derived from remote sensing data
   will correlate with climate change. In summary, a wetter summer and a
   drier spring and autumn were observed in NEC over the past 30 years.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {110},

Abstract = {Monitoring spatiotemporal variations of soil water content (theta) is
   important across a range of research fields, including agricultural
   engineering, hydrology, meteorology and climatology. Low frequency
   electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems have proven to be useful tools
   in mapping soil apparent electrical conductivity (sa) and soil moisture.
   However, obtaining depth profile water content is an area that has not
   been fully explored using EMI. To examine this, we performed time-lapse
   EMI measurements using a CMD mini-Explorer sensor along a 10m transect
   of a maize field over a 6 day period. Reference data were measured at
   the end of the profile via an excavated pit using 5TE capacitance
   sensors. In order to derive a time-lapse, depth-specific subsurface
   image of electrical conductivity (sigma), we applied a probabilistic
   sampling approach, DREAM((ZS)), on the measured EMI data. The inversely
   estimated sigma values were subsequently converted to theta using the
   Rhoades et al. (1976) petrophysical relationship. The uncertainties in
   measured sigma(a), as well as inaccuracies in the inverted data,
   introduced some discrepancies between estimated s and reference values
   in time and space. Moreover, the disparity between the measurement
   footprints of the 5TE and CMD Mini-Explorer sensors also led to
   differences. The obtained theta permitted an accurate monitoring of the
   spatiotemporal distribution and variation of soil water content due to
   root water uptake and evaporation. The proposed EMI measurement and
   modeling technique also allowed for detecting temporal root zone soil
   moisture variations. The time-lapse theta monitoring approach developed
   using DREAM( ZS) thus appears to be a useful technique to understand
   spatiotemporal patterns of soil water content and provide insights into
   linked soil moisture vegetation processes and the dynamics of soil
   moisture/infiltration processes.},

Abstract = {Field monitoring of soil moisture and groundwater levels is important to

   novel monitoring method using ultrasonic waves. The detector is composed
   of an ultrasonic transducer and a brass pipe whose lower end is inserted
   vertically into the ground. Ultrasonic waves generated by the transducer
   at the upper end of the pipe travel through it underground, and are
   reflected from the soil's surface at the bottom of the pipe. The soil's
   moisture is monitored by the intensity of the reflected ultrasonic waves
   and the groundwater level is monitored by the propagation time of the
   same waves. Indoor experiments were carried out using an artificial
   rainfall simulator and a soil tank. Shigaraki soil and Toyoura sand were
   used as soil samples in the experiments. The intensity of the reflected
   waves increased with the soil's water content and changed dramatically
   depending on whether the soil was fully dry, wet, or fully saturated.
   The propagation time decreased as the groundwater level rose. This
   method has advantages in that the detector can easily be installed on
   the ground surface and can simultaneously monitor both the soil moisture
   and groundwater level. (C) 2009 The Japan Society of Applied Physics},

   the ground wave velocity and to find the effective ground wave sampling
   depth under irrigation and drainage conditions. In this study, a
   PulseEkko 1000 GPR system with 450 MHz antennas was used at a sandy loam
   soil site. Water contents measured with time domain reflectometry (TDR)
   were used to determine the sampling depth of GPR based water content
   estimates. Cumulative irrigation and drainage calculated with GPR were
   found to be more closely related with cumulative irrigation and drainage
   measured with shorter TDR probes, suggesting that the ground wave
   sampling depth was in the 0.2-0.5 m range. During the infiltration phase
   the depth of the ground wave penetration was found to be in the 0-0.56 m
   range, assuming a sharp boundary between wet and dry sand. Comparison of
   water contents measured with the WARR and FO methods revealed that an
   antenna separation distance of 1.5-2.0 m for the FO method was required

Title = {Method for soil moisture retrieval in arid prairie using TerraSAR-X data},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {In arid prairie, soil moisture has a substantial impact on the prairie
   resource management. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based soil
   moisture retrieval is often hampered by vegetation effects on the
   backscattering coefficient. A new method has been proposed to retrieve
   soil moisture using TerraSAR-X data. The developed method included bare
   soil backscattering sigma(o)(ppsoil) simulation, vegetation effect
   correction, and the relationship between sigma(o)(ppsoil) and soil
   moisture establishment. The bare soil surface was described using the
   forward advanced integral equation model. The vegetation influence was
   eliminated through an empirical ratio method. Soil moisture was
   retrieved from the estimated sigma(o)(ppsoil). The collected datasets in
   Wutumeiren prairie were used to verify the developed method. Four
   different vegetation variables were incorporated to separate the
   influence of vegetation, including leaf area index (LAI), normalized
   difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and vegetation
   water content, respectively. The lowest soil moisture inversion error
   was found when LAI was applied to decouple the effect of vegetation,
   which led the root mean square error to reach up to 5.02 vol.\%. From
   the perspective of experiment results, LAI was recommended to
   characterize the scattering mechanism of vegetation. These results
   indicated that TerraSAR-X data have an operational potential for soil
   moisture retrieval in arid prairie. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical

Title = {The Variable Saturation Hydraulic Conductivity Method for Improving Soil
   Water Content Simulation in EPIC and APEX Models},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},

Abstract = {Soil water percolation is a key process in the life cycle of water in
   fields, watersheds, and river basins. The Environmental Policy
   Integrated Climate (EPIC) and the Agricultural Policy/Environmental
   eXtender (APEX) are continuous models developed for evaluating the
   environmental effects of agricultural management. Traditionally, these
   models have simulated soil water percolation processes using a
   tipping-bucket approach, with the rate of flow limited by the saturated
   hydraulic conductivity. This simple approach often leads to inaccuracy
   in simulating elevated soil water conditions where soil water content
   (SWC) levels may remain above field capacity under prolonged wet weather
   periods or limited drainage. To overcome this deficiency, a new
   sub-model, the variable saturation hydraulic conductivity (VSHC) method,
   was developed for simulating soil water percolation processes using a
   nonlinear equation to estimate the effective hydraulic conductivity as a
   function of the SWC and soil properties. The VSHC method was evaluated
   at three sites in the United States and two sites in Europe. In
   addition, a numerical solution of the Richards equation was used as a
   benchmark for SWC comparison. Results show that the VSHC method
   substantially improves the accuracy of the SWC simulation in long-term
   simulations, particularly during wet periods. At the watershed scale,
   results on the Riesel Y2 watershed indicate that the VSHC method
   enhances model performance in the high-flow regime of channel peak flows
   because of the improved estimation of SWC, which implies that the
   improved SWC simulation at the field scale is beneficial to hydrologic
   modeling at the watershed scale.},

Abstract = {Thermal remote sensing of soil moisture in vineyards is a challenge. The
   grass-covered soil, in addition to a standing grape canopy, create
   complex patterns of heating and cooling and increase the surface
   temperature variability between vine rows. In this study, we evaluate
   the strength of relationships between soil moisture, mechanical
   resistance and thermal inertia calculated from the drop of surface
   temperature during a clear sky night over a vineyard in the Niagara
   region. We utilized data from two sensors, an airborne thermal camera
   (height approximate to 500 m a.g.l.) and a handheld thermal gun (height
   approximate to 1 m a.g.l.), to explore the effects of different field of
   views and the high inter-row temperature variability. Spatial patterns
   of soil moisture correlated more with estimated thermal inertia than
   with surface temperature recorded at sunrise or sunset. Despite the
   coarse resolution of airborne thermal inertia images, it performed
   better than estimates from the handheld thermal gun. Between-row
   variation was further analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model.
   Despite the limited spatial variability of soil properties within a
   single vineyard, the magnitudes of the model coefficients for soil
   moisture and mechanical resistance are encouraging indicators of the
   utility of thermal inertia in vineyard management.},

   Validation in South-Western France},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Global soil moisture (SM) products are currently available thanks to
   microwave remote sensing techniques. Validation of these satellite-based
   SM products over different vegetation and climate conditions is a
   crucial step. INRA (National Institute of Agricultural Research) has set
   up the AQUI SM and soil temperature in situ network (composed of three
   main sites Bouron, Bilos, and Hermitage), over a flat area of dense pine
   forests, in South-Western France (the Bordeaux-Aquitaine region) to
   validate the Soil Moisture and Ocean salinity (SMOS) satellite SM
   products. SMOS was launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency (ESA).
   The aims of this study are to present the AQUI network and to evaluate
   the SMOS SM product (in the new SMOS-IC version) along with other
   microwave SM products such as the active ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer)
   and the ESA combined (passive and active) CCI (Climate Change
   Initiative) SM retrievals. A first comparison, using Pearson
   correlation, Bias, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and Un biased RMSE
   (ubRMSE) scores, between the 0-5 cm AQUI network and ASCAT, CCI, and
   SMOS SM products was conducted. In general all the three products were
   able to reproduce the annual cycle of the AQUI in situ observations. CCI
   and ASCAT had best and similar correlations (R similar to 0.72) over the
   Bouron and Bilos sites. All had comparable correlations over the
   Hermitage sites with overall average values of 0.74, 0.68, and 0.69 for
   CCI, SMOS-IC, and ASCAT, respectively. Considering anomalies,
   correlation values decreased for all products with best ability to
   capture day to day variations obtained by ASCAT. CCI (followed by
   SMOS-IC) had the best ubRMSE values (mostly < 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) over most
   of the stations. Although the region is highly impacted by radio
   frequency interferences, SMOS-IC followed correctly the in situ SM
   dynamics. All the three remotely-sensed SM products (except SMOS-IC over
   some stations) overestimated the AQUI in situ SM observations. These
   results demonstrate that the AQUI network is likely to be well-suited
   for satellite microwave remote sensing evaluations/validations.},

Abstract = {Understanding soil moisture and its relationship with different climatic
   and soil characteristics is essential for better analysing the
   interactions between forest and soil water dynamics, allowing us to more
   precisely predict climatic changes. The present paper investigates the
   temporal variability of soil moisture in three different forest
   ecosystems (LTER - long term ecological research site) with the same
   soil type (Eutric Cambisol). Soil moisture was measured daily from 2011
   to 2016 by using three sensors at three different depths (20, 40, 70
   cm). We identified the interactions between soil properties, vegetation
   type, local climatic conditions and soil moisture. In order to establish
   the temporal variability of the soil moisture content, we have applied
   two procedures, namely the Fourier series and the neural network
   fitting. A high variability in time and depth for soil volumetric water
   content was identified. The highest soil moisture levels were recorded
   at higher depths (70 cm) for almost all surfaces, with the exception of
   the Fundata surface because of the occurrence of limestone. In the
   mountainous areas, with higher precipitation (Fundata and Predeal
   sites), volumetric soil water content was mainly influenced by soil
   physical characteristics. Soil moisture levels below the drought level
   were only recorded for the Stalpeni site from September to October 2012.
   There was a delay between the precipitation event and soil
   humidification of 0.4-0.8 time units (days). We also found a significant
   correlation between soil moisture and soil texture and a weak
   correlation with vegetation type. Temperature influenced soil moisture
   levels at almost all depths, while precipitation only had an impact when
   there was a delay of 1 or 2 days. Our results can serve as a scientific
   base in the monitoring and analysing of soil moisture against the
   background of a changing climate.},

Title = {Evaluating Experimental Design of ERT for Soil Moisture Monitoring in
   Contour Hedgerow Intercropping Systems},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Contour hedgerow intercropping systems have been proposed as an
   alternative to traditional agricultural practice with a single crop, as
   they are effective in reducing run-off and soil erosion. However,
   competition for water and nutrients between crops and associated
   hedgerows may reduce the overall performance of these systems. To get a
   more detailed understanding of the competition for water, spatially
   resolved monitoring of soil water contents in the soil-plant-atmosphere
   system is necessary. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is
   potentially a valuable technique to monitor changes in soil moisture in
   space andtime. In this study, the performance of different ERT electrode
   arrays to detect the soil moisture dynamics in a mono-and an
   intercropping system was tested. Their performance was analyzed based on
   a synthetic study using geophysical measures, such as data recovery and
   resolution, and using spatial statistics of retrieved water content,
   such as an adjusted coefficient of variation and semivariances. The
   synthetic ERT measurements detected differences between the cropping
   systems and retrieved spatial structure of the soil moisture
   distribution, but the variance and semivariance were underestimated.
   Sharp water content contrasts between horizons or in the neighborhood of
   a root water uptake bulb were smoothened. The addition of electrodes
   deeper in the soil improved the performance, but sometimes only
   marginally. ERT is therefore a valuable tool for soil moisture
   monitoring in the field under different cropping systems if an electrode
   array is used which can resolve the patterns expected to be present in
   the medium. The use of spatial statistics allowed to not only identify
   the overall model recovery, but also to quantify the recovery of spatial
   structures.},

   European drought monitoring},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {525},
Pages = {547-558},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the context of evaluating the occurrence of drought events over
   Europe, soil moisture maps provide an invaluable resource to quantify
   the effects of rainfall deficits on vegetated lands. Spatially
   distributed models represent one of the main options, alongside
   satellite remote sensing, to successfully monitor this quantity over
   large areas in a cost effective way. This work has the double aim of:
   (i) intercomparing three soil moisture outputs obtained by different
   land-surface models (LISFOOD, CLM and TESSEL) through long (at least 6
   years of data between 2001 and 2011) in-situ measured datastreams, and
   (ii) quantifying the added value of combining the estimates of these
   three models by means of a simple ensemble approach. Generally, the
   three models return similar soil moisture anomalies over most of Europe,
   with few notable exceptions during summer in Mediterranean regions. The
   comparison with in-situ data suggests no substantial differences among
   the models, with LISFLOOD slightly outperforming the other two in terms
   of correlation as also supported by a pairwise comparison. The combined
   soil moisture anomalies obtained via the ensemble-mean approach are
   characterized by an increase of both the correlation and the accuracy in
   retrieving extreme events compared to the single models; however, the
   number of observed extreme events actually captured by the ensemble
   model does not increase significantly if compared to the single models.
   Overall, the ensemble model results are skillful, with an all site
   average skill score of about 0.4. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Richards' equation (RE) is the most common mathematical expression for
   soil water movement in a porous medium. Despite advancements in
   numerical schemes and high-performance computing, the requirements of
   iterative computations and fine grids hinder further extension of the RE
   to multi-dimensional and large-scale applications. Averaging methods of
   hydraulic conductivity have been known to be one of the significant
   factors affecting the accuracy of numerical solutions of the RE,
   especially when coarse grids are used. In this study, we developed a
   high-order averaging method of hydraulic conductivity for accurate
   numerical modeling of the RE, which has a straightforward formula
   regardless of the soil conditions and produces high simulation accuracy
   when used on coarse grids. The developed method is based on the
   high-order upwind scheme, which is widely used for hyperbolic partial
   differential equations within a finite volume framework in order to
   prevent numerical oscillations near a discontinuity while preserving
   high-order accuracy. Numerical simulations of several one- and
   two-dimensional cases performed in the study indicate that the proposed
   method outperforms existing simple averaging methods and is also
   superior, or at least equivalent, to complex averaging methods over a
   wide range of soil textures, especially on coarse grids. In addition,
   the proposed method is straightforwardly extended to nonorthogonal grids
   by being combined with the coordinate transformation method and the
   extension is verified through multi-dimensional test cases as well as
   tests on a heterogeneous soil domain. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Upscaling of sparse in situ soil moisture (SM) observations is essential
   for the validation of current and upcoming space-borne SM retrievals,
   and the successful application of SM observations in hydrological models
   or data assimilation. In this study, we construct a novel method based
   on Bayesian data fusion to up scale in situ SM observations to the
   coarse scale of microwave remote sensing. In the framework of Bayesian
   theory, the valuable auxiliary information obtained in Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) apparent thermal inertia
   (ATI) is integrated into the upscaling process. The method is validated
   using SM wireless sensor network data in the Tibetan plateau, which
   covers an area of approximately 30 x 30 km(2) with 20 in situ stations.
   Results confirm that the upscaled SM using the method with randomly
   selected three stations from the 20 stations is extremely close to the
   mean of the 20 SMs. The mean root mean square error (RMSE) between the
   upscaled SM and the mean of the 20 in situ SMs was 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and
   the max RMSE was less than 0.05 m(3) m(-3). Furthermore, the sensitivity
   of the upscaling accuracy to the number of in situ observations is
   discussed. When the number of in situ observations is greater than nine,
   the increasing accuracy of the Bayesian method is limited by the
   uncertainty in the ATI of the remote sensing.},

Abstract = {Monitoring the amount of moisture held in the soil is critical in the

   implementing risk reduction strategies for the Canadian agriculture
   sector. The calibrated Integral Equation Model (IEM) was used to
   estimate soil moisture for 15 RADARSAT-2 data sets acquired over an
   eastern and western Canadian test site. Using this approach, field level
   soil moisture was estimated to a mean average error of 7.95\%, although
   considerable scatter in the results was observed. Removing fields which
   had significant residue cover improved site specific soil moisture
   errors, but only for the fall campaign prior to spring tillage and seed
   bed preparation. Higher errors were also observed for data sets where
   angles between the RADARSAT-2 look direction and field tillage
   structures were largest. When soil moisture estimates were evaluated at
   a regional scale, mean errors fell to 3.14\%. The IEM was also able to
   detect increases and decreases in soil moisture which followed periods
   of rainfall and drying.},

Abstract = {In this study, an integration of microwave data obtained from the SMAP
   and AMSR2 satellite radiometers has been attempted, to achieve an
   accurate estimation of the Soil Moisture Content (SMC). This research
   aimed to overcome the failure of radar sensor in SMAP satellite as well
   as the failure to generate the radar/radiometer combined SMC product at
   a spatial resolution of 9 km x 9 km.
   A disaggregation technique, based on the Smoothing Filter based
   Intensity Modulation (SFIM), enabled us to obtain co-located SMAP and
   AMSR2 brightness measurements at L, C, X, Ku and Ka bands at
   approximately 10 km x 10 km on the selected test area, which corresponds
   to the entire Italian territory. These disaggregated microwave data were
   used as inputs of the ``HydroAlgo{''} retrieval algorithm based on
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which were able to exploit the synergy
   between radiometric acquisitions from these two sensors. The algorithm
   was defined, implemented and tested using all the overlapping orbits of
   SMAP and AMSR2 over Italy throughout the 9\_month period between April
   and December 2015. Distributed SMC reference values for implementing and
   validating the algorithm were obtained from the Soil Water Balance
   hydrological model, SWBM. Through HydroAlgo, an SMC product at a
   resolution of approximately 10 km x 10 km was obtained. This result is
   close to the original Radar/Radiometer SMC product from SMAP, with an
   average correlation coefficient R > 0.75 and RMSE congruent to 0.03
   m(3)/m(3), in both ascending and descending orbits.},

Title = {Spatial patterns of soil moisture from two regional monitoring networks

Abstract = {Understanding soil moisture spatial variability (SMSV) at regional
   scales is of great value for various purposes; however, relevant studies
   are still limited and have yielded inconsistent findings about the
   primary controls on regional SMSV. To further address this issue,
   long-term soil moisture data were retrieved from two large scale
   monitoring networks located in the continental United States, including
   the Michigan Automated Weather Network and the Oklahoma Mesonet. To
   evaluate different controls on SMSV, supporting datasets, which
   contained data on climate, soil, topography, and vegetation, were also
   compiled from various sources. Based on temporal stability analysis, the
   results showed that the mean relative difference (MRD) of soil moisture
   was more correlated with soil texture (e.g., negative correlations
   between MRD and sand fraction, and positive ones between LAIRD and silt
   and clay fractions) than with meteorological forcings in both regions,
   which differed from the traditional notion that meteorological forcings
   were the dominant controls on regional SMSV. Moreover, the results
   revealed that contrary to the previous conjecture, the use of soil
   moisture temporal anomaly did not reduce the impacts of static
   properties (e.g., soil properties) on soil moisture temporal dynamics.
   Instead, it was found that the magnitude of soil moisture temporal
   anomaly was mainly negatively correlated with sand fraction and
   positively with silt and clay fractions in both regions. Finally, the
   relationship between the spatial average and standard deviation of soil
   moisture as well as soil moisture temporal anomaly was investigated
   using the data from both networks. The field data showed that the
   relationship for both soil moisture and soil moisture temporal anomaly
   was more affected by soil texture than by climatic conditions (e.g.,
   precipitation). The results of this study provided strong field evidence
   that local factors (e.g., soil properties) might outweigh regional
   factors (e.g., meteorological forcings) in controlling regional SMSV.

Abstract = {At the Little River Watershed (LRW) heterogeneous landscape near Tifton
   Georgia US an in situ network of stations operated by the US Department
   of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service-Southeast Watershed Research
   Lab (USDA-ARS-SEWRL) was established in 2003 for the long term study of
   climatic and soil biophysical processes. To develop an accurate
   interpolation of the in situ readings that can be used to produce
   distributed representations of soil moisture (SM) and energy balances at
   the landscape scale for remote sensing studies, we studied (1) the
   temporal and spatial variations of ground temperature (GT) and infra red
   temperature (IRT) within 30 by 30 m plots around selected network
   stations; (2) the relationship between the readings from the eight 30 by
   30 m plots and the point reading of the network stations for the
   variables SM, GT and IRT; and (3) the spatial and temporal variation of
   GT and IRT within agriculture landuses: grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton
   and bare soil in the surrounding landscape. The results showed high
   correlations between the station readings and the adjacent 30 by 30 m
   plot average value for SM; high seasonal independent variation in the GT
   and IRT behavior among the eight 30 by 30 m plots; and site specific,
   in-field homogeneity in each 30 by 30 m plot. We found statistical
   differences in the GT and IRT between the different landuses as well as
   high correlations between GT and IRT regardless of the landuse. Greater
   standard deviations for IRT than for GT (in the range of 2-4) were found
   within the 30 by 30 m, suggesting that when a single point reading for
   this variable is selected for the validation of either remote sensing
   data or water-energy models, errors may occur. The results confirmed
   that in this landscape homogeneous 30 by 30 m plots can be used as
   landscape spatial units for soil moisture and ground temperature
   studies. Under this landscape conditions small plots can account for
   local expressions of environmental processes, decreasing the errors and
   uncertainties in remote sensing estimates caused by landscape
   heterogeneity. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Combining UAV-based hyperspectral imagery and machine learning
   algorithms for soil moisture content monitoring},
Journal = {PEERJ},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Month = {MAY 3},
Abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is an important factor that affects
   agricultural development in arid regions. Compared with the space-borne
   remote sensing system, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely
   used because of its stronger controllability and higher resolution. It
   also provides a more convenient method for monitoring SMC than normal
   measurement methods that includes field sampling and oven-drying
   techniques. However, research based on UAV hyperspectral data has not
   yet formed a standard procedure in arid regions. Therefore, a universal
   processing scheme is required. We hypothesized that combining
   pretreatments of UAV hyperspectral imagery under optimal indices and a
   set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield
   a highly accurate estimate of SMC. Optimal 2D spectral indices act as
   indispensable variables and allow us to characterize a model's SMC
   performance and spatial distribution. For this purpose, we used
   hyperspectral imagery and a total of 70 topsoil samples (0-10 cm) from
   the farmland (2.5 x 10(4) m(2)) of Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur
   AutonomousRegion, China. The random forest (RF) method and extreme
   learning machine (ELM) were used to estimate the SMC using six methods
   of pretreatments combined with four optimal spectral indices. The
   validation accuracy of the estimated method clearly increased compared
   with that of linear models. The combination of pretreatments and indices
   by our assessment effectively eliminated the interference and the
   noises. Comparing two machine learning algorithms showed that the RF
   models were superior to the ELM models, and the best model was PIR
   (R-val(2)= 0.907, RMSEP = 1.477, and RPD = 3.396). The SMC map predicted
   via the best scheme was highly similar to the SMC map measured. We
   conclude that combining preprocessed spectral indices and machine
   learning algorithms allows estimation of SMC with high accuracy
   (R-val(2) = 0.907) via UAV hyperspectral imagery on a regional scale.
   Ultimately, our program might improve management and conservation
   strategies for agroecosystem systems in arid regions.},

Abstract = {Land surface models (LSMs) have been widely used to provide objective
   monitoring of soil moisture during drought, but large uncertainties
   exist because of the different parameterizations in LSMs. This study
   aims to evaluate the ability to monitor soil moisture drought over three
   key regions in China by using the Noah LSM from the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System, version 2 (GLDASv2), and the Community Atmosphere
   Biosphere Land Exchange (CABLE) model that is currently used at the
   China Meteorological Administration. The modeled soil moisture drought
   indices were verified against the standardized precipitation
   evapotranspiration index (SPEI), which served as a reference drought
   indicator over northern China (NC), northwestern China (NWC), and
   southwestern China (SWC) from 1961 to 2010. The results show that the
   precipitation forcing data that drive both LSMs have high accuracy when
   compared with local observational data. GLDASv2/Noah outperforms CABLE
   in capturing soil moisture anomalies and variability, especially in SWC,
   but both show good correlations with the 3-month SPEI (SPEI3) in NC,
   NWC, and SWC. The autumn drought of 2002 and spring drought of 2010 were
   selected for the comparison of the modeled drought categories with the
   SPEI3 drought category, where GLDASv2/Noah performed slightly better
   than CABLE. This work demonstrates that the choice of LSM is crucial for
   monitoring soil moisture drought and that the GLDASv2/Noah LSM can be a
   good candidate for the development of a new operational
   drought-monitoring system in China.},

Abstract = {The regional verification of soil moisture is a vital step in evaluating
   and improving numerical model performance and utilizing forecast
   results. Currently, even with improved spatial and temporal resolutions
   of numerical model, verification methods for soil moisture data still
   rely on the traditional intensity verification parameters, such as mean
   error (ME) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Those methods provide
   only incomplete and sometimes inaccurate messages and thus hinder a
   proper evaluation of a forecast model. The SAL method is an object-based
   regional verification method with respect to precipitation forecasts.
   Based on the SAL method, a novel object-based method (SAL-DN) is
   proposed here, which can be used to test regional soil moisture. Both
   the ideal experiment and real experiment show that the SAL-DN method can
   reveal the differences between the observed and forecast soil moisture
   in three aspects: structure, amplitude, and location, and the results
   can reflect the actual situation. Furthermore, compared with the SAL
   method, the SAL-DN method is also capable of verifying physical
   quantities with high-value and low-value centers like temperature.
   Therefore, the SAL-DN method enhances verification accuracy and can be
   applied widely.},

   Monitoring Network},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is an essential variable in many hydrological and
   meteorological models. Spatially continuous soil moisture datasets are
   important for understanding water cycle and climate change. Currently,
   satellite-based microwave sensors have been the main resources for
   obtaining global soil moisture data. This paper evaluates the
   performance of different soil moisture products from the combined
   Essential Climate Variable (ECV) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) satellite against the stations within the OzNet soil moisture
   networks over southeastern Australia. SMOS soil moisture products
   obtained from two versions (ascending and descending) were included. The
   evaluations were carried out at both network and site scales. According
   to the validation results, the ECV products outperformed the SMOS
   products at both scales. Comparing the two versions of the SMOS
   products, the SMOS ascending product generally performed better than the
   SMOS descending product and obtained comparable accuracy to the ECV
   product at Kyeamba and Yanco sites. However, the SMOS ascending
   performed poorly at the Adelong sites. Moreover, the ECV product has
   less data gaps than the SMOS products, because the ECV products were
   developed by combining passive and active microwave products.
   Consequently, the results in this study show that the combined ECV
   product is recommended, as both accuracy and integrity of the soil
   moisture product are important. The SMOS ascending product is
   recommended between the two overpass versions of SMOS products.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a fundamental data source used by the United States
   Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Production Assessment
   Division (IPAD) to monitor crop growth stage and condition and
   subsequently, globally forecast agricultural yields. Currently, the USDA
   IPAD estimates surface and root-zone soil moisture using a two-layer
   modified Palmer soil moisture model forced by global precipitation and
   temperature measurements. However, this approach suffers from well-known
   errors arising from uncertainty in model forcing data and highly
   simplified model physics. Here, we attempt to correct for these errors
   by designing and applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data
   assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from
   the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA
   modified Palmer soil moisture model. An assessment of soil moisture
   analysis products produced from this assimilation has been completed for
   a five-year (2002 to 2007) period over the North American continent
   between 23 degrees N-50 degrees N and 128 degrees W-65 degrees W. In
   particular, a data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate
   the added utility of integrating remotely sensed soil moisture by
   comparing EnKF soil moisture results obtained using (relatively)
   low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite
   imagery to baseline Palmer model runs forced with higher quality
   rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation
   suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture
   retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions
   derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.},

Abstract = {Estimation of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) at regional scales is a
   critical issue in surface hydrology that could be a great help for
   estimating evapotranspiration, erosion, runoff, and irrigation
   requirements, etc. A significant number of satellites {[}soil moisture
   and ocean salinity (SMOS), special sensor microwave imager (SSM/ I),
   advanced microwave scanning radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), tropical rainfall
   measuring mission/ microwave imager (TRMM/ TMI), etc.] retrieve surface
   soil moisture (SSM) using passive microwave remote sensing. This
   information can be used to derive RZSM using a new mathematical filter.
   In particular, the recently developed soil moisture analytical
   relationship (SMAR) can relate the surface soil moisture to the moisture
   of deeper layer using a relationship derived from a soil water balance
   equation where infiltration is estimated based on the relative
   fluctuations of soil moisture in the surface soil layer. In the present
   paper, the SMAR model is tested on two research databases in Africa and
   North America {[}African monsoon multidisciplinary analysis (AMMA) and
   soil climate analysis network (SCAN), respectively], where field
   measurements at different depths are available. Furthermore, the TRMM/
   TMI Satellite is selected to retrieve the satellite SSM data of the
   studied regions using the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). Both
   remotely sensed SSM and field measurements are used within the SMAR
   model to explore their ability in reproducing the RZSM and also to
   explore the existing difference in model parameterization moving from
   one dataset to the other. The SMAR model is applied using three
   different schemes: (1) with parameters calibrated using surface field
   measurements, (2) with parameters calibrated using remotely sensed SSM
   as input, and finally (3) using the remotely sensed SSM with the same
   parameters calibrated in Scheme 1. In all cases, SMAR parameters have
   been calibrated using a genetic algorithm optimizing the root-mean
   square error (RMSE) between SMAR prediction and measured RZSM. The
   results show that remotely sensed data may be coupled with the SMAR
   model to provide a good description of RZSM dynamics, but it requires a
   specific parameterization respect to Scheme 1. Nevertheless, it is
   surprising to observe that two of the four parameters of the model
   related to the soil texture are relatively stable moving from
   remote-sensed to field data. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil

Abstract = {Soil moisture data can reflect valuable information on soil properties,
   terrain features, and drought condition. The current study compared and
   assessed the performance of different interpolation methods for
   estimating soil moisture in an area with complex topography in southwest
   China. The approaches were inverse distance weighting, multifarious
   forms of kriging, regularized spline with tension, and thin plate
   spline. The 5-day soil moisture observed at 167 stations and daily
   temperature recorded at 33 stations during the period of 2010-2014 were
   used in the current work. Model performance was tested with accuracy
   indicators of determination coefficient (R-2), mean absolute percentage
   error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), relative root mean square
   error (RRMSE), and modeling efficiency (ME). The results indicated that
   inverse distance weighting had the best performance with R2, MAPE, RMSE,
   RRMSE, and ME of 0.32, 14.37, 13.02\%, 0.16, and 0.30, respectively.
   Based on the best method, a spatial database of soil moisture was
   developed and used to investigate drought condition over the study area.
   The results showed that the distribution of drought was characterized by
   evidently regional difference. Besides, drought mainly occurred in
   August and September in the 5 years and was prone to happening in the
   western and central parts rather than in the northeastern and

Abstract = {Soil moisture from ERA-Land, a revised version of the land surface

   Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), is used to monitor at a global scale
   the consistency of a new microwave based multi-satellite surface soil
   moisture date set (SM-MW) over multi-decadal time period (1980-2010).
   ERA-Land results from Land Surface Model simulations forced by high
   quality atmospheric forcing data. It was shown to adequately capture the
   temporal dynamic of soil moisture. ERA-land's large scale nature, frozen
   configuration, global availability and ability to accurately represent
   soil moisture variability make it suitable to complement typical
   validation approaches of soil moisture from remote sensing based on
   ground measurements. Considering locations that have significant
   correlations for each 3-year sub periods within 1980-2010, averaged soil
   moisture correlations of SM-MW with ERA-Land (at 95\% Confidence
   Interval) are increasing steadily from 1986 to 2010 (from 0.52 +/- 0.10,
   to 0.66 +/- 0.04). The lower correlations mirror the periods where only
   passive microwave from the Special Sensor Microwave/Image (SSM/I Ku band
   at 19.3 GHz) sensor was used, highlighting the importance of
   multi-sensor capabilities. Overall SM-MW is relatively stable over time
   with respect to ERA-Land. Good agreement is obtained in semi-arid areas,

Title = {Estimating Soil Moisture Patterns with Remote Sensing and Terrain Data
   at the Small Catchment Scale},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Detailed information on the temporal and spatial evolution of soil
   moisture patterns is of fundamental importance to improve runoff
   prediction, optimize irrigation management and to enhance crop
   forecasting. However, obtaining representative soil moisture
   measurements at the catchment scale is challenging because of the
   dynamic spatial and temporal behavior of soil moisture. High-resolution
   remote sensing data provide detailed spatial information about catchment
   characteristics (e. g., terrain and land use) that can be used as
   proxies to estimate soil moisture. We assessed the potential use of
   combined multitemporal multispectral remote sensing (RS) and terrain
   data for estimating spatial soil moisture patterns at the small
   catchment scale. The fuzzy c-means sampling and estimation approach (FCM
   SEA) was applied to conduct a sensor (proxy) directed (guided) sampling
   and to reconstruct multitemporal soil moisture patterns based on time
   domain reflectometry measurements. A comprehensive soil moisture
   database for the Schafertal catchment, located in central Germany, was
   used to test, validate, and compare the FCM SEA performances of the
   combined remote sensing data with those of a benchmark approach driven
   solely by terrain data. Results from the study show that a FCM SEA model
   that integrates bi-temporal RS imagery and terrain data was more
   effective in estimating spatial soil moisture patterns relative to the
   benchmark model. It outperformed the benchmark model in 58\% of the
   cases and was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed
   variance for a range of different catchment moisture conditions. This
   was achieved with only a small sample size (n = 30). The results of this
   study are promising because they highlight the importance of considering
   multitemporal RS and terrain data and demonstrate how in situ sensors
   can be optimally placed to enable cost-efficient monitoring and
   prediction of spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment
   scale.},

Abstract = {Regional soil moisture monitoring has always been a difficult point in
   many researches. The traditional point measurement and the large scale
   remote sensing monitoring are always unable to obtain information of
   medium and small scale regional soil moisture. As a new type of
   mesoscale soil moisture condition monitoring method, the cosmic ray
   neutron method can obtain the soil moisture information within 300 m
   radius of the source region, which covers the shortage of the point
   measuring method and remote sensing method. This study utilized cosmic
   ray neutron instrument (CRS) to constantly monitor soil moisture, and
   conducted the applicability research of cosmic ray neutron method in
   soil moisture monitoring. Results show high consistency of CRS and time
   domain reflectometer (TDR) measurements, the fitting degree is 0.847,
   the root mean square error is 0.020 kg/kg. Also, CRS is sensitive to
   precipitation, it can clearly show the increase of soil moisture under
   different conditions, while the sensitivity of TDR is relatively poor.
   This research can provide a reference for dynamic change monitoring of
   regional mesoscale soil moisture.},

Abstract = {A simple approach for correcting for the effect of vegetation in the
   estimation of the surface soil moisture (w(S)) from L-band passive
   microwave observations is presented in this study. The approach is based
   on semi-empirical relationships between soil moisture and the polarized
   reflectivity including the effect of the vegetation optical depth which
   is parameterized as a function of the normalized vegetation difference
   index (NDVI). The method was tested against in situ measurements
   collected over a grass site from 2004 to 2007 (SMOSREX experiment). Two
   polarizations (horizontal/vertical) and five incidence angles (20
   degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees, 50 degrees, and 60 degrees) were
   considered in the analysis. The best w(S) estimations were obtained when
   using both polarizations at an angle of 40 degrees. The average accuracy
   in the soil moisture retrievals was found to be approximately 0.06
   m3/m3, improving the estimations by 0.02 m3/m3 with respect to the case
   in which the vegetation effect is not considered. The results indicate
   that information on vegetation (through a vegetation index such as NDVI)
   is useful for the estimation of soil moisture through the semi-empirical
   regressions.},

Abstract = {In order to improve accuracy of soil moisture inversion using remote

   used to solve the soil thermal inertia so that the remote sensing

   vegetation, but usually only for the bare areas or worse vegetation
   covered areas. The model has been tested at several locations in the

Abstract = {The enormous increase of remote sensing data from airborne and

   attention is devoted to machine learning methods due to their
   flexibility and the capability to process large number of inputs and to

Abstract = {Soil moisture from Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) passive microwave
   satellite data was assessed as an information source for identifying
   regions experiencing climate-related agricultural risk for a period from
   2010 to 2013. Both absolute soil moisture and soil moisture anomalies
   compared to a 4-yr SMOS satellite baseline were used in the assessment.
   The 4-yr operational period of SMOS was wetter than the 30-yr climate
   normal in many locations, particularly in the late summer for most
   regions and in the spring for the province of Manitoba. This leads to a
   somewhat unrepresentative baseline that skews anomaly measures at
   different parts of the growing season. SMOS soil moisture does, however,
   show a clear trend where extremes are present, with drier-than-average
   conditions during periods that drought and dry soil risks were
   identified and wetter-than-average conditions when flooding and excess
   moisture were present. Areas where extreme weather events caused crop
   losses were identifiable using SMOS soil moisture, both at the
   provincial and regional scales. The variability in soil moisture between
   at-risk areas and normal areas is very small but consistent, both
   geographically and over time, making SMOS a good real-time indicator for
   risk assessment.},

Volume = {21},
Number = {4},
Pages = {476-486},
Abstract = {A variational data assimilation method is proposed to estimate the
   near-surface soil moisture and surface sensible and latent heat fluxes.
   The method merges the five parts into a cost function, i.e., the
   differences of wind, potential temperature, and specific humidity
   gradient between observations and those computed by the profile method,
   the difference of latent heat fluxes calculated using the ECMWF land
   surface evaporation scheme and the profile method, and a weak constraint
   for surface energy balance. By using an optimal algorithm, the best
   solutions are found. The method is tested with the data collected at
   Feixi Station (31.41 degrees N, 117.08 degrees E) supported by the China
   Heavy Rain Experiment and Study (HeRES) during 7-30 June 2001. The
   results show that estimated near-surface soil moistures can quickly
   respond to rainfall, and their temporal variation is consistent with
   that of measurements of average soil moisture over 15-cm top depth with
   a maximum error less than 0.03 m(3) m(-3). The surface heat fluxes
   calculated by this method are consistent with those by the Bowen ratio
   method, but at the same time it can overcome the instability problem
   occurring in the Bowen ratio method when the latter is about -1.
   Meanwhile, the variational method is more accurate than the profile
   method in terms of satisfying the surface energy balance. The
   sensitivity tests also show that the variational method is the most
   stable one among the three methods.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial distribution and temporal changes of the global
   soil moisture for a long period of time is crucial to the understanding
   of climate changes and hydrological processes. By applying Fourier
   analysis to the time-series observations from the space-borne passive

   soil moisture changes and help to generate the historical soil moisture
   datasets with an improved accuracy. The method is applied to the
   observations from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E). Validations using field sampled soil moisture
   from two watersheds in the U.S. indicate that the method can effectively
   improve the sensitivity of current National Aeronautics and Space

   the surface soil moisture, with the correlation coefficients of the

Month = {AUG 14},
Abstract = {Although many methods of soil moisture measurement exist, there remains
   a lack of soil moisture sensor with small volume, high precision,
   excellent real-time performance and distributed monitoring capability.
   In this paper, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based carbon fiber heated
   sensor (CFHS) that can overcome the deficiencies in soil moisture
   movement is proposed. The CFHS consists of a carbon fiber rod with a
   diameter of 5 mm, quas-distributed FBG sensors on an optical fiber, a
   coating, two binding posts, and two electric cables. Laboratory
   calibration tests have been conducted to establish an empirical
   piece-wise relationship between the temperature characteristic value and
   soil moisture for sand, silt and clay. A laboratory validation test
   under normal gravity and a centrifuge test under overweight conditions,
   have been performed to verify the feasibility of this technique for soil
   moisture monitoring. The test results show that the CFHS can (i)
   accurately record soil moisture under normal gravitational and
   overweight conditions and (ii) track the evolution of capillary zones,
   and the generation and migration of moisture transition zones under
   centrifuge acceleration. During a response period of 5 min, the accuracy
   is 0.033m(3)/m(3) under 1 g condition, and 0.047m(3)/m(3) under
   overweight condition. With the advantages of small sensor size, low
   disturbance of soil mass and wide adaptability in physical model tests,
   the proposed method can achieve distributed soil moisture measurement at
   different scales and with high efficiency.},

Abstract = {A soil moisture content map is important for providing information about
   the distribution of moisture in a given area. Moisture content directly
   influences agricultural yield thus it is crucial to have accurate and
   reliable information about moisture distribution and content in the
   field. Since soil is a porous medium modified generalized Archie's
   equation provides the basic formula to calculate moisture content data
   based on measured ECa. In this study we aimed to find a more accurate
   and cost effective method for measuring moisture content than manual
   field sampling. Locations of 25 sampling points were chosen from our
   research field as a reference. We assumed that soil moisture content
   could be calculated by measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
   using the Veris-3100 on-the-go soil mapping tool. Statistical analysis
   was carried out on the 10.791 ECa raw data in order to filter the
   outliers. The applied statistical method was +/- 1.5 interquartile (IRQ)
   distance approach. The visualization of soil moisture distribution
   within the experimental field was carried out by means of ArcGIS/ArcMAP
   using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method. In the
   investigated 25 sampling points, coefficient of determination between
   calculated volumetric moisture content data and measured ECa was R-2 =
   0.87. According to our results, volumetric moisture content can be
   mapped by applying ECa measurements in these particular soil types.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to examine the effect of

   applied at planting and remaining N applied at V6 growth stage) and five
   N rates (0, 45, 90, 135, and 180 kg N ha(-1)) were utilized. Increasing
   soil depth decreased extractable phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and
   calcium (Ca) contents in the soil. The nitrate (NO3)-N concentration in
   deeper soil was similar to the top layer as N fertilization was greater
   than 90 kg N ha(-1). It suggests that N application should be less than
   90 kg ha(-1) to reduce the movement of excess N to deep soil layers and

Title = {A Self-Powered and Autonomous Fringing Field Capacitive Sensor
   Integrated into a Micro Sprinkler Spinner to Measure Soil Water Content},

Abstract = {We present here the design and fabrication of a self- powered and
   autonomous fringing field capacitive sensor to measure soil water
   content. The sensor is manufactured using a conventional printed circuit
   board and includes a porous ceramic. To read the sensor, we use a
   circuit that includes a 10 kHz triangle wave generator, an AC amplifier,
   a precision rectifier and a microcontroller. In terms of performance,
   the sensor's capacitance ( measured in a laboratory prototype) increases
   up to 5\% when the volumetric water content of the porous ceramic
   changed from 3\% to 36\%, resulting in a sensitivity of S = 15.5 pF per
   unity change. Repeatability tests for capacitance measurement showed
   that the theta(v) sensor's root mean square error is 0.13\%. The average
   current consumption of the system ( sensor and signal conditioning
   circuit) is less than 1.5 mu A, which demonstrates its suitability for
   being powered by energy harvesting systems. We developed a complete
   irrigation control system that integrates the sensor, an energy
   harvesting module composed of a microgenerator installed on the top of a
   micro sprinkler spinner, and a DC/ DC converter circuit that charges a 1
   F supercapacitor. The energy harvesting module operates only when the
   micro sprinkler spinner is irrigating the soil, and the supercapacitor
   is fully charged to 5 V in about 3 h during the first irrigation. After
   the first irrigation, with the supercap fully charged, the system can
   operate powered only by the supercapacitor for approximately 23 days,
   without any energy being harvested.},

Abstract = {the present work, we have investigated Polyvinyl Alcohol (PVA) modified
   Zinc Oxide nanowires (ZnONW) heterostructure based microsensors platform
   to measure the relative humidity and gravimetricsoil moisture contents
   for agriculture applications. For this the hydrothermal growth of ZnO NW
   is carried out on Inter Digitated Electrodes (IDEs) patterned on Si/SiO2
   substrates. Further, ZnO NW surfaceis functionalized by drop casting PVA
   solution. The surface characterization of the PVA coated ZnO NWs-film is
   carried out by X-Ray diffraction (XRD), Fourier transform infrared
   spectroscopy (FTIR), ScanningElectron Microscopy (SEM) and
   Current-Voltage (IV) measurements. These measurements revealed the
   successful formation of PVA-ZnO NW heterostructure. The microsensors are
   exposed to different levels of relative humidity (\% RH) ranging from 40
   to 90\% and various moisture contents of bentonite and redsoils. It is
   observed that the microsensors resistance decreases with increase in
   humidity (\% RH) and gravimetric soil moisture contents (red and
   bentonite), respectively. The sensor exhibited a sensitivityof 4.6 K
   Omega / 0.1\% change in RH. Further, sensitivities of 7.5 and 12.2
   Omega/ 0.1\% change in gravimetric water content when exposed to
   bentonite and red soil samples respectively were achieved. The low cost,
   goodre producibility, repeatability and good stability with time
   indicated that PVA modified ZnO NW hetero structure microsensors
   platform is potentially useful for measurement of humidity and soil
   moisture contents in agriculture applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {We investigate in this paper the effect of plane and profile curvatures
   on the soil moisture distribution and related fluxes obtained from field
   experiments. Today, there is a need also to confirm the theoretical
   approaches of the kinematic wave approximation with the real field
   measurements. Within a research project dedicated to the model-based
   description of runoff formation processes, field measurements of soil
   moisture dynamics and numerical simulation, using one simply formulated
   kinematic wave model, are combined. It is shown that the measurement of
   the soil moisture movement downwards within a hillslope can be
   interpreted by the kinematic wave model and vice versa how the model can
   be validated in its physical explanations by the field measurements. It
   is revealed that the soil moisture fluxes can be described by kinematic
   waves crossing the soil mantle of the hillslope. Based on these analyses
   it is shown that the two topographic characteristics plane and profile
   curvatures of the hillslope control the subsurface and saturation flow.

Abstract = {Limited water supplies in arid regions put constraints on agriculture.
   In arid New Mexico, greenhouse chile pepper production has the potential
   for water and nutrient savings. The objectives of this study were to (1)
   compare two capacitance sensors - (Hydra probes and 5TM) and one TDR
   CS616 sensor, (2) compute actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for
   drip-irrigated chile peppers for three water treatments, and (3) develop
   new crop coefficients (K-c) for the three growing seasons in a
   greenhouse study. Three water treatments were (1) control where water
   was applied near the surface using two drip emitters, (2) partial root
   zone drying vertical (PRDv) where subsurface irrigation was applied at
   20 cm depth from soil surface, and (3) partial root zone drying
   compartment (PRDc) where roots were divided into two compartments and
   irrigation were switched between compartments after 15 days.
   Sensor-generated volumetric water contents (theta) were correlated with
   the gravimetrically determined theta, and the new calibration
   coefficients improved the precision of theta estimates. From 2011
   onward, irrigation amounts were adjusted to minimize deep percolation,
   and about 30\% less water was applied in 2014 as compared to the 2011
   growing season but no significant differences were observed in
   transpiration rate and leaf temperature. The ratio of intercellular to
   ambient CO2 concentrations (Ci/Ca) was significantly correlated to
   transpiration rate and vapor pressure deficit in 2014 (P < 0.05). ETa
   obtained from water balance and reference ET (ETr) from Penman-Monteith
   developed the K-c for drip-irrigated greenhouse chile peppers for three
   growing seasons. The maximum values of K-c were about 1.4 during 2013
   and 1.2 during 2014. The 2011 growing season was shorter and the maximum
   K-c were closer to one. Crop coefficients for greenhouse grown chile
   peppers varied with growing seasons and irrigation treatment. Irrigation
   scheduling can be done based on the soil moisture or K-c for the known
   growing season. This study demonstrated the water saving potential of

Abstract = {We show that satellite-derived estimates of shallow soil moisture can be
   used to calibrate a land surface model at the regional scale in Ghana,
   using data assimilation techniques. The modified calibration
   significantly improves model estimation of soil moisture. Specifically,
   we find an 18\% reduction in unbiased root-mean-squared differences in
   the north of Ghana and a 21\% reduction in the south of Ghana for a
   5-year hindcast after assimilating a single year of soil moisture
   observations to update model parameters. The use of an improved remotely
   sensed rainfall dataset contributes to 6\% of this reduction in
   deviation for northern Ghana and 10\% for southern Ghana. Improved
   rainfall data have the greatest impact on model estimates during the
   seasonal wetting-up of soil, with the assimilation of remotely sensed
   soil moisture having greatest impact during dryingdown. In the north of
   Ghana we are able to recover improved estimates of soil texture after
   data assimilation. However, we are unable to do so for the south. The
   significant reduction in unbiased root-mean-squared difference we find
   after assimilating a single year of observations bodes well for the
   production of improved land surface model soil moisture estimates over
   sub-Saharan Africa.},

Volume = {113},

Abstract = {Many studies have shown the deficiencies of the extended Kalman filter
   (EKF), even though it has become a standard technique used in nonlinear
   estimation. In the EKF method, the state distribution is propagated
   analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear
   system, which can introduce large errors in variable estimation and may
   lead to suboptimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter.
   The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) addresses these problems using a
   deterministic sampling approach to capture the posterior mean and
   covariance accurate to the third order for any nonlinearity, while the
   dual-UKF method uses two UKF filters (one for state variables and one
   for parameters, in contrast to only one filter in the usual UKF) to
   simultaneously optimize the model states and parameters using
   observational data. In this paper, we employ the dual-UKF method to
   account for the effects of land surface subgrid-scale heterogeneity and
   soil water thawing and freezing and implement it into the NCAR Community
   Land Model version 2.0 to build a data assimilation system for
   assimilating satellite observations of soil moisture. Experiments for
   two sites in north and south China show that this dual-UKF-based
   assimilation system outperforms the usual UKF- and EKF-based methods in
   reproducing the temporal evolution of daily soil moisture, especially
   under freezing conditions. Furthermore, the improvement also propagates,
   albeit to a lesser extent, to lower layers where observations are
   unavailable.},

Abstract = {This is a review article with the objective of summarizing and relating
   the main findings of different research projects carried out in Florida
   that evaluated commercially available soil moisture sensor systems
   (SMSs) for residential irrigation control. The initial goal of the
   experiments cited was to find out if SMSs could reduce irrigation water
   application as compared to typical residential irrigation systems
   without sensor feedback. The effect of different threshold settings and
   irrigation frequencies on water application and turf quality was also
   evaluated Other research goals included evaluating the consistency of
   different SMS units and their precision in measuring soil water content
   (theta). Results on turfgrass plots showed that a 7 days per week (d
   week(-1)) irrigation frequency significantly reduced the water applied
   compared to 1 and 2 d week(-1) scheduled frequencies. During rainy
   periods, the SMSs tested reduced irrigation by 42\% to 72\% on average,
   depending on specific testing conditions, while maintaining good turf
   quality. During dry periods, the average savings decreased to -1\% to
   64\%, and the resultant turf quality was sometimes below the minimum
   acceptable level. Therefore, under sustained thy weather conditions or
   in dry climates, the run times, irrigation frequency, and/or low
   threshold settings should be carefully considered. Results showed that
   SMSs from Acclima and Rain Bird were more consistent and precise in
   measuring soil water content and saved more water than Water Watcher and
   Irrometer units. Under residential conditions, SMSs decreased the water
   application by 65\% compared to homes with automated irrigation systems
   without sensor feedback. Overall research results clearly demonstrate
   that the use of SMSs in Florida, when properly installed, set, and
   maintained, could lead to significant irrigation water savings while
   maintaining turf quality at or above the minimum acceptable rating.},

Abstract = {As the soil moisture content (w) is a deterministic factor for

   detection, an on-line measurement system will bring these applications
   into practice. A fibre-type visible (VIS) and near-infrared (NIR)
   spectrophotometer, with a light reflectance measurement range of
   306.5-1710.9 nm was used to measure to during field operation. The
   spectrophotometer optical unit was attached to the subsoiler chisel
   backside to perform the light reflectance measurement from the soil
   surface on the bottom of the trench opened by the proceeded chisel. The
   spectrophotometer-optical unit system was calibrated for to under
   stationary laboratory conditions on samples collected from an Arenic
   Cambisol field with different soil textures. A partial least square
   analysis was carried out in order to establish a statistical model
   relating soil light spectra with the gravimetric W of the 0.005-0.26 kg
   kg(-1) range. This model was validated with the full cross validation
   method resulting in a small root mean square error of cross validation
   (RMSECV) of 0.0175 kg kg(-1) and a high validation correlation of 0.978.
   Further validation of the model developed in the laboratory under
   stationary state showed also a small root mean square error of
   prediction (RMSEP) of 0.0165 kg kg(-1) and a prediction correlation of
   0.982. When the NIR sensor-model system was used to determine w. based
   on on-line field measurement, a relatively larger RMSEP of 0.025 kg
   kg(-1) and lower prediction correlation of 0.75 were found. However, a
   reasonably similar spatial distribution of W was found between the
   on-line NIR measurement and oven drying methods. Therefore. the on-line
   NIR to sensor developed is recommended to provide valuable information
   towards the site-specific applications in soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {The prediction of the spatial and temporal variability of land surface
   states and fluxes with land surface models at high spatial resolution is
   still a challenge. This study compares simulation results using
   TerrSysMP including a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model
   (ParFlow) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM) of a 38 ha managed
   grassland head-water catchment in the Eifel (Germany), with soil water
   content (SWC) measurements from a wireless sensor network, actual
   evapotranspiration recorded by lysimeters and eddy covariance stations
   and discharge observations. TerrSysMP was discretized with a 10 x 10 m
   lateral resolution, variable vertical resolution (0.025-0.575 m), and
   the following parameterization strategies of the subsurface soil
   hydraulic parameters: (i) completely homogeneous, (ii) homogeneous
   parameters for different soil horizons, (iii) different parameters for
   each soil unit and soil horizon and (iv) heterogeneous stochastic
   realizations. Hydraulic conductivity and Mualem-Van Genuchten parameters
   in these simulations were sampled from probability density functions,
   constructed from either (i) soil texture measurements and Rosetta
   pedotransfer functions (ROS), or (ii) estimated soil hydraulic
   parameters by 1D inverse modelling using shuffle complex evolution
   (SCE).
   The results indicate that the spatial variability of SWC at the scale of
   a small headwater catchment is dominated by topography and spatially
   heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameters. The spatial variability of the
   soil water content thereby increases as a function of heterogeneity of
   soil hydraulic parameters. For lower levels of complexity, spatial
   variability of the SWC was underrepresented in particular for the
   ROS-simulations. Whereas all model simulations were able to reproduce
   the seasonal evapotranspiration variability, the poor discharge
   simulations with high model bias are likely related to short-term ET
   dynamics and the lack of information about bedrock characteristics and
   an on-site drainage system in the uncalibrated model. In general,
   simulation performance was better for the SCE setups. The SCE
   simulations had a higher inverse air entry parameter resulting in SWC
   dynamics in better correspondence with data than the ROS simulations
   during dry periods. This illustrates that small scale measurements of
   soil hydraulic parameters cannot be transferred to the larger scale and
   that interpolated 1D inverse parameter estimates result in an acceptable
   performance for the catchment. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {A Seven-Rod Dielectric Sensor for Determination of Soil Moisture in
   Well-Defined Sample Volumes},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel seven-rod sensor used for time-domain
   reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR)
   measurements of soil water content in a well-defined sample volume. The
   probe directly measures the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum and
   for this purpose requires three calibration media: air, water, and
   ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to study the
   influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the
   probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as
   a verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soilssandy
   loam and two silt loamswith six water contents from air-dry to
   saturation. The conversion from <mml:semantics>S11</mml:semantics>
   parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network
   analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid
   procedure. The simulation and measurement results for the real part of
   the isopropanol dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers
   with different diameters were in good agreement with literature data up
   to 200 MHz. The real part of the dielectric permittivity was extracted
   and related to the moisture of the tested soil samples. Relations
   between the volumetric water content and the real part of the dielectric
   permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by TDR) were
   compared with Topp's equation. It was concluded that the best fit to
   Topp's equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data
   calculated according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and
   Roth gave results closer to Topp's calibration. The obtained results
   indicated that the seven-rod probe can be used to accurately measure of
   the dielectric permittivity spectrum in a well-defined sample volume of
   about 8 cm(3) in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 200 MHz.},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important property for agriculture, but currently
   commercialized soil moisture sensors are too expensive for many farmers.
   The objective of this study is to develop a low-cost soil moisture
   sensor using capacitors on a film substrate and a capacitive touch
   integrated circuit. The performance of the sensor was evaluated in two
   field experiments: a grape field and a mizuna greenhouse field. The
   developed sensor captured dynamic changes in soil moisture at 10, 20,
   and 30 cm depth, with a period of 10-14 days required after sensor
   installation for the contact between capacitors and soil to settle down.
   The measured soil moisture showed the influence of individual sensor
   differences, and the influence masked minor differences of less than
   0.05 m(3).m(-3) in the soil moisture at different locations. However,
   the developed sensor could detect large differences of more than 0.05
   m(3).m(-3), as well as the different magnitude of changes, in soil
   moisture. The price of the developed sensor was reduced to 300 U.S.
   dollars and can be reduced even more by further improvements suggested
   in this study and by mass production. Therefore, the developed sensor
   will be made more affordable to farmers as it requires low financial
   investment, and it can be utilized for decision-making in irrigation.},

Abstract = {Mining affects the environment in different ways depending on the
   physical context in which the mining occurs. In mining areas with an
   arid environment, mining affects plants' growth by changing the amount
   of available water. This paper discusses the effects of mining on two
   important determinants of plant growth-soil moisture and groundwater
   table (GWT)-which were investigated using an integrated approach
   involving a field sampling investigation with remote sensing (RS) and
   ground-penetrating radar (GPR). To calculate and map the distribution of
   soil moisture for a target area, we initially analyzed four models for
   regression analysis between soil moisture and apparent thermal inertia
   and finally selected a linear model for modeling the soil moisture at a
   depth 10 cm; the relative error of the modeled soil moisture was about
   6.3\% and correlation coefficient 0.7794. A comparison of mined and
   unmined areas based on the results of limited field sampling tests or RS
   monitoring of Landsat 5-thermatic mapping (TM) data indicated that soil
   moisture did not undergo remarkable changes following mining. This
   result indicates that mining does not have an effect on soil moisture in
   the Shendong coal mining area. The coverage of vegetation in 2005 was
   compared with that in 1995 by means of the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) deduced from TM data, and the results showed
   that the coverage of vegetation in Shendong coal mining area has
   improved greatly since 1995 because of policy input RMBAyen0.4 per ton
   coal production by Shendong Coal Mining Company. The factor most
   affected by coal mining was GWT, which dropped from a depth of 35.41 m
   before mining to a depth of 43.38 m after mining at the Bulianta Coal
   Mine based on water well measurements. Ground-penetrating radar at
   frequencies of 25 and 50 MHz revealed that the deepest GWT was at about
   43.4 m. There was a weak water linkage between the unsaturated zone and
   groundwater, and the decline of water table primarily resulted from the
   well pumping for mining safety rather than the movement of cracking
   strata. This result is in agreement with the measurements of the water
   wells. The roots of nine typical plants in the study area were
   investigated. Populus was found to have the deepest root system with a
   depth of about 26 m. Based on an assessment of plant growth demands and
   the effect of mining on environmental factors, we concluded that mining
   will have less of an effect on plant growth at those sites where the
   primary GWT depth before mining was deep enough to be unavailable to
   plants. If the primary GWT was available for plant growth before mining,
   especially to those plants with deeper roots, mining will have a
   significant effect on the growth of plants and the mechanism of this
   effect will include the loss of water to roots and damage to the root
   system.},

Abstract = {In this study, we assessed induced polarization as potential
   non-destructive method for root detection in dike embankments. We used
   both laboratory and field experiment to describe the electrical signal
   with a focus on soil water content. Our objective was to determine in
   which hydric state of the soil, and related electrical properties, roots
   could be accurately discriminated. We hypothesized that preferential
   water zone absorption near the roots could, in some conditions,
   contribute to locate them.
   During the laboratory experiments, we compared the response of
   containers filled with the same homogeneous silty clay bare material,
   and without (A) or with freshly cut root (B) at different levels of soil
   water content. Resistivity and phase variations with soil water content
   indicated that it was preferable to work in dry conditions since the
   contrast was higher.
   Interactions and overlapping between polarization effects of both root
   and soil made it difficult to interpret first chargeability maps. This
   led us to study temporal-spatial variations by considering the dynamics
   of water absorption during a field experiment.
   High resolution time lapses images showed a correlation between root
   location and complex resistivity anomalies. Although these first results
   have to be confirmed by further measurements, induced polarization seems
   to add useful information to interpret anomalies produced by woody
   roots. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Choice of stocking method may impact soil, plant, and animal responses.
   This 3-yr study evaluated stocking method effects on animal behavior and
   soil nutrient concentration in `Pensacola' bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum
   Flugge) pastures. Stocking methods were continuous stocking and
   rotational stocking with 1-, 3-, 7-, and 21-d grazing periods and a 21-d
   resting period. Responses were measured in three zones based on distance
   from shade and water (Zone 1, 0-8 m; Zone 2, 8-16 m; Zone 3, >16 m).
   Indices were calculated to weight number of dung and urine events and
   time spent by cattle in a zone by the proportion of the total pasture
   and paddock area represented by that zone. Indices were most uniform
   (similar to 1) across zones for rotational stocking with short grazing
   periods and generally increased linearly in Zones 1 and 2 with
   increasing grazing period. Except for N, soil nutrient concentration was
   not affected by stocking method. In zones closest to shade and water,
   soil nutrients accumulated for all methods in the surface 8 cm but not
   in the 8- to 23-cm layer. Air temperature, wind speed, and
   temperature-humidity index explained 49\% of the variation in time
   cattle spent under shade, confirming the importance of the environment
   in animal behavior. In warm environments, structural features of
   stocking method (e. g., the position of shade and water) have a greater
   effect on animal behavior and distribution in the landscape than do
   stocking density-mediated effects on competition for forage.},

Abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a new method for continuously
   monitoring mean soil water content (SWC) on a hectometer scale. To
   evaluate the application and accuracy of the method for SWC observation
   in an alpine meadow ecosystem (AME), we installed the CRNS in a flat
   meadow near the Naqu prefecture on the northern Tibetan Plateau. We
   collecting soil samples and applying the system by the oven-drying
   method. A weather station was also installed near the CRNS for
   monitoring basic meteorological variables and the soil temperature and
   water content at various depths. Three Em-50 instruments for monitoring
   SWC and soil temperature were buried in three sub-quadrats northwest,
   northeast and southeast of the CRNS at distances of 460, 370 and 373 m,
   respectively, to observe the variation of SWC at the various depths. The
   footprint of the CRNS for SWC observation in the meadow was about 580 m,
   and the mean measuring depth was about 31 cm according to the general
   calculation equations. The reference neutron flux for dry soil (N-0) had
   a mean and coefficient of variation of 8686 and 3\%, respectively, and
   remained substantially invariant throughout the measuring period. The
   five SWCs from the independent field samples almost passed through the
   SWC trend of the CRNS, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.011 m(3)
   m(-3) for the CRNS and oven-drying method. The time series of SWC
   measured by the CRNS agreed well with the mean SWC series to a depth of
   20 cm measured by the weather station. The trend of SWC measured by the
   Em-50s generally agreed with the trend of SWC measured by the CRNS, but
   some values and variations of SWC differed between the Em-50s and CRNS
   data. Because of the good agreement between the CRNS and independent
   field samples, we suspect that this disagreement is due to an
   insufficient representativeness of point observations and the distances
   of the points from the CRNS. The diurnal variation of hourly SWC from
   the, CRNS was sinusoidal during a dry period, peaking at 11:00 and was
   minimum at 18:00 (Beijing time), with a range of 1\%. Overall, the CRNS
   measured SWC in the AME with an acceptable accuracy, providing a
   scientific basis for the promotion and application of the CRNS in high,
   cold ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Soil water is an important factor affecting photosynthesis,
   transpiration, growth, and yield of crops. Accurate information on soil
   water content (SWC) is crucial for practical agricultural water
   management at various scales. In this study, remotely sensed parameters
   (leaf area index, and cover type, and albedo) and spatial data
   manipulated using the geographic information system (GIS) technique were
   assimilated into the boreal ecosystem productivity simulator (BEPS)
   model to monitor SWC dynamics of croplands in Jiangsu Province, China.
   The monsoon climate here is characterized by large interannual and
   seasonal variability of rainfall causing periods of high and low SWC.
   Model validation was conducted by comparing simulated SWC with
   measurements by a gravimetric method in the years 2005 and 2006 at nine
   agro-meteorological stations. The model-to-measurement R-2 values ranged
   from 0.40 to 0.82. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values were in the range
   from 0.10 to 0.80. Root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from
   0.028 to 0.056 m(3) m(-3). Simulated evapotranspiration (ET) was
   consistent with ET estimated from pan evaporation measurements. The BEPS
   model successfully tracked the dynamics and extent of the serious soil
   water deficit that occurred during September-November 2006. These
   results demonstrate the applicability of combining process-based models
   with remote sensing and GIS techniques in monitoring SWC of croplands

Year = {2010},
Volume = {48},
Number = {6},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {A recently developed data assimilation technique offers the potential to
   greatly expand the geographic domain over which remotely sensed surface
   soil moisture retrievals can be evaluated by effectively substituting
   (relatively plentiful) rain-gauge observations for (less commonly
   available) ground-based soil moisture measurements. The technique is
   based on calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (R-value)
   between rainfall errors and Kalman filter analysis increments realized
   during the assimilation of a remotely sensed soil moisture product into
   the antecedent precipitation index (API). Here, the existing R-value
   approach is modified by reformulating it to run on an anomaly basis
   where long-term seasonal trends are explicitly removed and by
   calculating API analysis increments using a Rauch-Tung- Striebel
   smoother instead of a Kalman filter. This reformulated approach is then
   applied to a number of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer soil
   moisture products acquired within three heavily instrumented watershed
   sites in the southern U.S. R-value-based evaluations of soil moisture
   products within these sites are verified based on comparisons with
   available ground-based soil moisture measurements. Results demonstrate
   that, without access to ground-based soil moisture measurements, the
   R-value methodology can accurately mimic anomaly correlation
   coefficients calculated between remotely sensed soil moisture products
   and soil moisture observations obtained from dense ground-based
   networks. Sensitivity results also indicate that the predictive skill of
   the R-value metric is enhanced by both proposed modifications to its
   methodology. Finally, R-value calculations are expanded to a
   quasi-global (50 degrees S-50 degrees N) domain using rainfall
   measurements derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission
   Precipitation Analysis. Spatial patterns in calculated R-value fields
   are compared to regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling and used to
   refine expectations concerning the global distribution of land areas in
   which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals will contribute
   to atmospheric forecasting applications.},

Abstract = {Experiments in agriculture usually consider the topsoil properties to be
   uniform in space and, for this reason, often make inadequate use of the
   results. The objective of this study was to assess the variability for
   soil moisture content using geostatistical techniques. The experiment
   was carried out on a Rhodic Ferralsol (typic Haplorthox) in Campinas,
   SP, Brazil, in an area of 3.42 ha cultivated under the no tillage
   system, and the sampling was made in a grid of 102 points spaced 10 m x
   20 m. Access tubes were inserted down to one meter at each evaluation
   point in order to measure soil moisture contents (cm(3)cm(-3)) at depths
   of 30, 60 and 90 cm with a neutron moisture gauge. Samplings were made
   between the months of August and September of 2003 and in January 2004.
   The soil moisture content for each sampling date was analyzed using
   classical statistics in order to appropriately describe the central
   tendency and dispersion on the data and then using geostatistics to
   describe the spatial variability. The comparison between the spatial
   variability for different samplings was made examining scaled
   semivariograms. Water content was mapped using interpolated values with
   punctual kriging. The semivariograms showed that, at the 60 ern depth,
   soil water content had moderate spatial dependence with ranges between
   90 and 110 m. However, no spatial dependence was found for 30 and 90 cm
   depths in 2003. Sampling density was insufficient for an adequate
   characterization of the spatial variability of soil moisture contents at
   the 30 and 90 cm depths.},

Abstract = {The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a low-input rice (Oryza

   several ways: seedlings are transplanted earlier and are more widely

   fertilizer, and soils are irrigated intermittently rather than flooded
   for long periods. The yield benefits of SRI compared to conventional
   systems can be substantial, and yet are regionally variable and have
   been the subject of considerable debate, due partly to a lack of
   mechanistic understanding. Here we show that soil properties may in part
   explain the variability in yield response to SRI. A meta-analysis of
   data from 72 field studies where SRI was compared with conventional
   systems indicates that yields increased significantly (P < 0.0001) when
   SRI was implemented on highly weathered infertile soils rich in iron and
   aluminum oxides (Acrisols and Ferralsols), but there was no difference
   in yield between SRI and conventional systems in more fertile favorable
   soils for rice production (Gleysols, Luvisols and Fluvisols). The yield
   difference between SRI and conventional rice production therefore
   appears to be related in part to soil properties linked to weathering.
   This should help resolve the debate about the value of SRI and allow
   research to be targeted toward understanding the biological and chemical
   processes in soils under SRI management.},

Abstract = {Availability of soil moisture observations at a high spatial and
   temporal resolution is a prerequisite for various hydrological,
   agricultural and meteorological applications. In the current study, a
   novel algorithm for merging soil moisture from active microwave (SAR)
   and passive microwave is presented. The MAPSM algorithmMerge Active and
   Passive microwave Soil Moistureuses a spatio-temporal approach based on
   the concept of the Water Change Capacity (WCC) which represents the
   amplitude and direction of change in the soil moisture at the fine
   spatial resolution. The algorithm is applied and validated during a
   period of 3 years spanning from 2010 to 2013 over the Berambadi
   watershed which is located in a semi-arid tropical region in the
   Karnataka state of south India. Passive microwave products are provided
   from ESA Level 2 soil moisture products derived from Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite (3 days temporal resolution and 40 km
   nominal spatial resolution). Active microwave are based on soil moisture
   retrievals from 30 images of RADARSAT-2 data (24 days temporal
   resolution and 20 m spatial resolution). The results show that MAPSM is
   able to provide a good estimate of soil moisture at a spatial resolution
   of 500 m with an RMSE of 0.025 m when comparing it to soil moisture from
   RADARSAT-2 and in-situ measurements, respectively. The use of Sentinel-1
   and RISAT products in MAPSM algorithm is envisioned over other areas
   where high number of revisits is available. This will need an update of
   the algorithm to take into account the angle sampling and resolution of
   Sentinel-1 and RISAT data.},

Abstract = {Scaling of fluid flow in general is outlined and contrasted to the
   scaling of water flow in porous media. It is then applied to deduce
   Darcy's law, thereby demonstrating that stationarity of the flow field
   at the scale of the representative elementary volume (REV) is a critical
   prerequisite. The focus is on the implications of the requirement of
   stationarity, or local equilibrium, in particular on the validity of the
   Richards equation for the description of water movement through soils.
   Failure to satisfy this essential requirement may occur at the scale of
   the REV or, particularly in numerical simulations, at the scale of the
   model discretization. The latter can be alleviated by allocation of more
   computational resources and by working on a finer-grained
   representation. In contrast, the former is fundamental and leads to an
   irrevocable failure of the Richards equation as is observed with
   infiltration instabilities that lead to fingered flow.},

Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {We used a recent ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methodology, early-time
   amplitude analysis, with the goal of monitoring changes in soil water
   content (SWC) in response to irrigation in clayey soils. We hypothesized
   that early-time analysis could be used to monitor changes in SWC in
   clay-rich soil where ground wave and reflection-based GPR methods
   traditionally fail. An overnight irrigation experiment was performed in
   a 20-by 14-m section of natural grassland at the Samford Ecological
   Research Facility in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Both GPR
   reflection surveys and ground wave velocity analysis were ineffective at
   the site due to the signal attenuation associated with the clay-rich
   soil. We collected daily GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data
   sets during a 5-d period in August 2014, with soil samples collected for
   gravimetric analysis at the conclusion of data collection. The GPR data
   display a clear response of the early-time signal amplitude to changes
   in SWC. The GPR data sets exhibit a strong correlation with SWC, as
   measured by TDR and gravimetric analysis of soil cores, which is
   consistent with the dependence of GPR early-time amplitude on relative
   permittivity. The results suggest that the early-time method can be used
   to obtain spatially distributed information on subsurface moisture
   content in clay-rich soils.},

   because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the land

   described in terms of its basic principle, measurement scales,

Abstract = {. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and land surface
   temperature (T-s) data from the multitemporal Moderate Resolution
   Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used to analyze the NDVI-T-s
   space. Unlike the traditional triangular or trapezoidal NDVI-T-s space,
   the NDVI-T-s space in this study was biparabolic when NDVI values below
   0.15 were included, describing areas that are vegetated but have low
   biomass due to arid conditions. Moreover, the NDVI-T-s biparabolic space
   is slightly better than the NDVI-T-s triangular space at discerning soil
   moisture (validation at a 10-cm depth). Linear relationships exist
   between TVDIC obtained from the NDVI-T-s biparabolic space and relative
   soil moisture with R-2 > 0.28, while correlation coefficient between
   TVDIT obtained from the triangular NDVI-T-s space and relative soil
   moisture is R-2 > 0.08. The soil moisture situations in Henan Province
   from February 26, 2011 to May 16, 2011 and in the Shendong mining area
   on October 8, 2010 were evaluated based on the temperature vegetation
   dryness index (TVDI) obtained from the NDVI-T-s biparabolic space.

Abstract = {The study presents an in-depth investigation of the properties of
   remotely sensed rainfall error propagation in the prediction of
   near-surface soil moisture from a land surface model (LSM).
   Specifically, two error sources are compared: rainfall forcing due to
   estimation error by remote sensing techniques and the representation of
   land-atmospheric processes due to LSM uncertainty {[} the Community Land
   Model, version 3.5 (CLM3.5), was used in this particular study]. CLM3.5
   is forced by three remotely sensed precipitation products, namely, two
   satellite-based estimates-NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
   (TRMM) multisatellite precipitation analysis and NOAA's Climate
   Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH)-and a rain gauge-adjusted
   radar-rainfall product from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler
   (WSR-88D) network. The error analysis is performed for the warm seasons
   of 2004 and 2006 and is facilitated through the use of in situ
   measurements of soil moisture, rainfall, and other meteorological
   variables from a network of stations capturing the state of Oklahoma
   (Oklahoma Mesonet). The study also presents a rigorous benchmarking of
   the Mesonet network as to its accuracy in deriving area rainfall
   estimates at the resolution of satellite products (0.25 degrees and 3 h)
   through comparisons against the most definitive measurements of a
   smaller-yet-denser network of rain gauges in southwestern Oklahoma
   (Micronet). The study compares error statistics between modeling and
   precipitation error sources and between the various remote sensing
   techniques. Results are contrasted between the relatively moist summer
   period of 2004 to the drier summer period of 2006, indicating model and
   error propagation dependencies. An intercomparison between rainfall and
   modeling error shows that the two error sources are of similar
   magnitudes in the case of high modeling accuracy (i.e., 2004), whereas
   the contribution of rainfall forcing error to the uncertainty of soil
   moisture prediction can be lower when the model's efficiency skill is
   relatively low (i.e., 2006).},

Abstract = {The status, availability and distribution of moisture distribution
   within a crop's root zone depths affect the yield and growth of crops.
   An experiment was carried out to determine the influence of three drip
   irrigation regimes on pattern of moisture distribution within the soil
   profile of Amaranthus cruentus field. Irrigations were carried out at 50
   KPa ( Low stress), 60 KPa ( Medium stress) and 70 KPa ( Severe stress)
   levels. The pattern of soil water extraction differed significantly
   among treatments ( P<0.05). A. cruentus extracts water for its use
   depending on available moisture within depths of the root zone. The
   surface soil at 0.1 and 0.2 m depths, rapidly losses moisture at the
   peak of the dry season in treatment 70 KPa ( severely stressed level).
   Soil hydraulic charge was high (- 80.6 and - 70.9 KPa) at crop emergence
   in the root zone of A. cruentus during the dry season experiment of 2005
   and 2006 respectively. It however reduced to as low as - 5.7 KPa at crop
   maturity ( 71 - 76 DOY) due to occasional rain showers experienced
   around the period of crop maturity. Relationship between soil hydraulic
   charge and soil moisture storage gave r(2) = 0.82 and standard deviation
   +/- 1.19 at P < 0.05. The findings from this research may be useful at
   determining the appropriate moisture stress level at which irrigation is
   best carried out in vegetable field for optimum yield.},

Abstract = {Based on 1-km land surface model geophysical predictions within the
   United States Southern Great Plains (Red-Arkansas River basin), an
   observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) is carried out to assess
   the impact of land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and
   parameter uncertainty on soil moisture products derived from the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration Hydrosphere State (Hydros)
   mission. Simulated retrieved soil moisture products are created using
   three distinct retrieval algorithms based on the characteristics of
   passive microwave measurements expected from Hydros. The accuracy of
   retrieval products is evaluated through comparisons with benchmark soil
   moisture fields obtained from direct aggregation of the original
   simulated soil moisture fields. The analysis provides a quantitative
   description of how land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and
   inversion parameter uncertainty impacts propagate through the
   measurement and retrieval process to degrade the accuracy of Hydros soil
   moisture products. Results demonstrate that the discrete set of error
   sources captured by the OSSE induce root mean squared errors of between
   2.0\% and 4.5\% volumetric in soil moisture retrievals within the basin.
   Algorithm robustness is also evaluated for the case of artificially
   enhanced vegetation water content (W) values within the basin. For large
   W(> 3 kg (.) m(-2)), a distinct positive bias, attributable to the
   impact of sub-footprint-scale landcover heterogeneity, is identified in
   soil moisture retrievals. Prospects for the removal of this bias via a
   correction strategy for inland water and/or the implementation of an
   alternative aggregation strategy for surface vegetation and roughness
   parameters are discussed.},

Abstract = {The practice of applying large amounts of P to agricultural land over
   several previous decades, particularly in regions with intensive

   increased risk of P losses into water bodies and thus of eutrophication.
   This work is aimed at analyzing the spatiotemporal changes in
   extractable soil P content at the regional level by means of a soil test
   database and then comparing results with independent data from
   agricultural censuses. A total of 228 079 soil P-test values {[}Dyer
   method: 1:5 soil-citric acid solution (20 g/L) ratio] generated between
   1980 and 2003 by certified commercial laboratories in Brittany

   analysed by considering four 4-6 year periods between 1980 and 2003
   using cumulative frequencies and summary statistics performed on raw
   soil test values. Then data were aggregated into discrete entities
   (canton: administrative entities) and summary statistics, linear
   regression and spatial distribution were carried out. P balances were
   measured for the same entities taken from the agricultural censuses of
   1979, 1988 and 2000. Over the entire study period, a marked spatial
   variability was observed with higher P content in the western part of
   Brittany, as well as a systematic increase in median P content with
   lower amplitude over the past decade. The mean cantonal soil P surplus
   accumulated over 24 years amounted to 763 kg P/ha of usable agricultural
   land. Similar P balances sometimes gave rise to widely different
   increases in P. Cumulative balances were positively correlated with an
   increase in soil P (r(2) = 0.34).},

Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Month = {NOV 13},
Abstract = {Operational land surface models (LSMs) compute hydrologic states such as
   soil moisture that are needed for a range of important applications (e.
   g., drought, flood, and weather prediction). The uncertainty in LSM
   parameters is sufficiently great that several researchers have proposed
   conducting parameter estimation using globally available remote sensing
   data to identify best fit local parameter sets. However, even with in
   situ data at fine modeling scales, there can be significant remaining
   uncertainty in LSM parameters and outputs. Here, using a new uncertainty
   estimation subsystem of the NASA Land Information System (LIS)
   (described herein), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is
   applied to conduct Bayesian analysis for the accounting of parameter
   uncertainties. The Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) MCMC
   algorithm was applied, for which a new parallel implementation was
   developed. A case study is examined that builds on previous work in
   which the Noah LSM was calibrated to passive (L-band) microwave remote
   sensing estimates of soil moisture for the Walnut Gulch Experimental
   Watershed. In keeping with prior related studies, the parameters
   subjected to the analysis were restricted to the soil hydraulic
   properties (SHPs). The main goal is to estimate SHPs and soil moisture
   simulation uncertainty before and after consideration of the remote
   sensing data. The prior SHP uncertainty is based on the original source
   of the standard SHP lookup tables for the Noah LSM. Conclusions are
   drawn regarding the value and viability of Bayesian analysis over
   alternative approaches (e. g., parameter estimation, lookup tables) and
   further research needs are identified.},

Abstract = {ERT techniques are especially promising in (semi-arid) areas with
   shallow and rocky soils where other methods fail to produce soil
   moisture maps and to obtain soil profile information. Electrical
   Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was performed in the Peyne catchment in
   southern France at four sites located on four different geological
   substrates. The main objective was to test the usefulness of such
   geoelectrical method for the assessment of spatial and temporal
   variability of soil water content and to demarcate subsurface horizontal
   zones: topsoil, active zone and bedrock. We used time lapse ERT to
   separate lithological variability from soil moisture content and to
   evaluate its potential to demarcate subsurface soil horizons. Three
   measurement campaigns were carried out and field data were collected
   using the Sting R1/IP advanced resistivity meter with one-channel
   receiver. We used an array of 28 electrodes with 1 m spacing, which
   provided reliable resistivity information to a depth of approximately
   5.5 m. ERT were followed by soil sampling carried out with a hand auger,
   directly below the respective geoelectrical profiles. Empirical linear
   regression was used to determine the specific relationships between
   volumetric soil moisture of the field samples and electrical resistivity
   data obtained in situ. Our conclusions are that ERT is a useful
   technique for providing information on the spatial temporal variability
   of water content in semi-arid areas and for reaching depths otherwise
   inaccessible. In this study we proposed a method to delineate three
   important different soil zones: topsoil, active zone, bedrock, based on
   resistivity data. These three layers are essential information in
   understanding and modelling the interaction between subsurface and
   vegetation water uptake, particularly in semi-arid regions.},

Year = {2013},
Volume = {144},
Number = {1},
Pages = {66-77},

Abstract = {Preferential flow in agricultural soils has been demonstrated to result
   in agrochemical mobilisation to shallow ground water. Land managers and
   environmental regulators need simple cost effective techniques for
   identifying soil - land use combinations in which preferential flow
   occurs. Existing techniques for identifying preferential flow have a
   range of limitations including; often being destructive, non in situ,
   small sampling volumes, or are subject to artificial boundary
   conditions. This study demonstrated that high frequency soil moisture
   monitoring using a multi-sensory capacitance probe mounted within a
   vertically rammed access tube, was able to determine the occurrence,
   depth, and wetting front velocity of preferential flow events following
   rainfall. Occurrence of preferential flow was not related to either
   rainfall intensity or rainfall amount, rather preferential flow occurred
   when antecedent soil moisture content was below 226 mm soil moisture
   storage (0-70 cm). Results indicate that high temporal frequency soil
   moisture monitoring may be used to identify soil type - land use
   combinations in which the presence of preferential flow increases the
   risk of shallow groundwater contamination by rapid transport of
   agrochemicals through the soil profile. However use of high frequency
   based soil moisture monitoring to determine agrochemical mobilisation
   risk may be limited by, inability to determine the volume of
   preferential flow, difficulty observing macropore flow at high
   antecedent soil moisture content, and creation of artificial voids
   during installation of access tubes in stony soils. Crown Copyright (C)

Title = {Soil moisture-runoff relation at the catchment scale as observed with
   coarse resolution microwave remote sensing},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {9},
Number = {3},
Pages = {173-183},
Abstract = {Microwave remote sensing offers emerging capabilities to monitor global
   hydrological processes. Instruments like the two dedicated soil moisture
   missions SMOS and HYDROS or the Advanced Scatterometer on-board METOP
   will provide a flow of coarse resolution microwave data, suited for
   macro-scale applications. Only recently, the scatterometer onboard of
   the European Remote Sensing Satellite, which is the precursor instrument
   of the Advanced Scatterometer, has been used successfully to derive soil
   moisture information at global scale with a spatial resolution of 50 km.
   Concepts of how to integrate macroscale soil moisture data in hydrologic
   models are however still vague. In fact, the coarse resolution of the
   data provided by microwave radiometers and scatterometers is often
   considered to impede hydrological applications. Nevertheless, even if
   most hydrologic models are run at much finer scales, radiometers and
   scatterometers allow monitoring of atmosphere-induced changes in
   regional soil moisture patterns. This may prove to be valuable
   information for modelling hydrological processes in large river basins
   (> 10 000 km(2)). In this paper, ERS scatterometer derived soil moisture
   products are compared to measured runoff of the Zambezi River in
   south-eastern Africa for several years (1992-2000). This comparison
   serves as one of the first demonstrations that there is hydrologic
   relevant information in coarse resolution satellite data. The observed
   high correlations between basin-averaged soil moisture and runoff time
   series (R-2 > 0.85) demonstrate that the seasonal change from low runoff
   during the dry season to high runoff during the wet season is well
   captured by the ERS scatterometer. It can be expected that the high
   correlations are to a certain degree predetermined by the pronounced
   inter-annual cycle observed in the discharge behaviour of the Zambezi.
   To quantify this effect, time series of anomalies have been compared.
   This analysis showed that differences in runoff from year to year could,
   to some extent, be explained by soil moisture anomalies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we studied the effect of spatial distribution of soil
   parameters on passive soil moisture retrieval at pixel scale. First, we
   evaluated the forward microwave emission model and soil moisture
   retrieval algorithm accuracy through the observation of field
   experiments. Then, we used soil parameters in different spatial
   distribution patterns, including random, normal, and uniform
   distribution, to determine the different levels of heterogeneity on soil
   moisture retrieval, in order to seek the relationship between
   heterogeneity and soil moisture retrieval error. Finally, we conducted a
   controlled heterogeneity effect experiment measurements using a
   Truck-mounted Multi-frequency Radiometer (TMMR) to validate our
   simulation results. This work has proved that the soil moisture
   retrieval algorithm had a high accuracy (RMSE=0.049 cm(3) cm(-3)) and
   can satisfy the need of this research. The simulation brightness
   temperatures match well with observations, with RMSE=9.89 K. At passive
   microwave remote sensing pixel scale, soil parameters with different
   spatial distribution patterns could have different levels of error on
   soil moisture estimation. Overall, we found that soil moisture with a
   random distribution in a satellite pixel scale can cause the largest
   error, with a normal distribution being the second, and a uniform
   distribution the least due to the smallest heterogeneity.},

Title = {Soil Surface Sealing Effect on Soil Moisture at a Semiarid Hillslope:
   Implications for Remote Sensing Estimation},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {6},
Number = {8},
Pages = {7469-7490},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Robust estimation of soil moisture using microwave remote sensing
   depends on extensive ground sampling for calibration and validation of
   the data. Soil surface sealing is a frequent phenomenon in dry
   environments. It modulates soil moisture close to the soil surface and,
   thus, has the potential to affect the retrieval of soil moisture from
   microwave remote sensing and the validation of these data based on
   ground observations. We addressed this issue using a physically-based
   modeling approach that accounts explicitly for surface sealing at the
   hillslope scale. Simulated mean soil moisture at the respective layers
   corresponding to both the ground validation probe and the radar beam's
   typical effective penetration depth were considered. A cyclic pattern
   was found in which, as compared to an unsealed profile, the seal layer
   intensifies the bias in validation during rainfall events and
   substantially reduces it during subsequent drying periods. The analysis
   of this cyclic pattern showed that, accounting for soil moisture
   dynamics at the soil surface, the optimal time for soil sampling
   following a rainfall event is a few hours in the case of an unsealed
   system and a few days in the case of a sealed one. Surface sealing was
   found to increase the temporal stability of soil moisture. In both
   sealed and unsealed systems, the greatest temporal stability was
   observed at positions with moderate slope inclination. Soil porosity was
   the best predictor of soil moisture temporal stability, indicating that
   prior knowledge regarding the soil texture distribution is crucial for
   the application of remote sensing validation schemes.},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {18},
Number = {1},
Pages = {5-23},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this paper, an experimental soil moisture drought monitoring and
   seasonal forecasting framework based on the Variable Infiltration
   Capacity model (VIC) over southwestern China (SW) is presented.
   Satellite precipitation data are used to force VIC for a near-real-time
   estimate of land surface hydrologic conditions. Initialized with
   satellite-aided monitoring (MONIT), the climate model (CFSv2)-based
   forecast (MONIT+CFSv2) and ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP)-based
   forecast (MONIT+ESP) are both performed. One dry season drought and one
   wet season drought are employed to test the ability of this framework in
   terms of real-time tracking and predicting the evolution of soil
   moisture (SM) drought, respectively. The results show that the skillful
   CFSv2 climate forecasts (CFs) are only found at the first month. The
   satellite-aided monitoring is able to provide a reasonable estimate of
   forecast initial conditions (ICs) in real-time mode. In the presented
   cases, MONIT+CFSv2 forecast exhibits comparable performance against the
   observation-based estimates for the first month, whereas the predictive
   skill largely drops beyond 1 month. Compared to MONIT+ESP, MONIT+CFSv2
   ensembles give more skillful SM drought forecast during the dry season,
   as indicated by a smaller ensemble range, while the added value of
   MONIT+CFSv2 is marginal during the wet season. A quantitative
   attribution analysis of SM forecast uncertainty demonstrates that SM
   forecast skill is mostly controlled by ICs at the first month and that
   uncertainties in CFs have the largest contribution to SM forecast errors
   at longer lead times. This study highlights a value of this framework in
   generating near-real-time ICs and providing a reliable SM drought
   prediction with 1 month ahead, which may greatly benefit drought
   diagnosis, assessment, and early warning.},

Abstract = {This study investigates the performance of empirical and semiempirical
   models to predict soil moisture from the data of RADARSAT II synthetic
   aperture radar (SAR) for the Yarmouk basin in Jordan. Data of SAR were
   obtained forMay and June 2010 and were processed to obtain backscatter
   (sigma(o)) data for the study area. Results showed significant
   correlations between soil moisture content (m(v)) and horizontally
   polarized sigma(o), with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.64. The
   root mean square error for the SAR volumetric soil moisture content was
   0.09 and 0.06 m(3)/m(3) for the empirical and semiempirical regression
   models, respectively. Both models had different clustering patterns in
   the soil moisture maps in the study area. The spatial agreement between
   maps of soil moisture was in the range of 55 to 65 \% when the maps were
   reclassified based on intervals of 5 \% mv for both models. In terms of
   soil moisture interval, both models showed that most of soil moisture
   changes between the two images (dates) were in the range of +/- 5 \%.
   Some high differences in.mv were observed between the two models. These
   were mainly attributed to the non-inverted pixels in the soil moisture
   maps produced by the semiempirical model. Therefore, this model may be
   applied for a limited range of soil moisture prediction. The use of
   regression model could predict a wider range for soil moisture when
   compared with the semiempirical model. However, more work might be
   needed to improve the empirical model before scaling it up to the whole

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at three depths (15, 25, and 30 cm), derived from the
   optical trapezoidal model (OPTRAM), was used for multiyear, multisite
   monitoring of agricultural droughts over two agricultural crops (Maize

   satellite data from Sentinel-2 and was validated against field SM
   assessed by gravimetric methods and by Watermark Sensors in sandy-soils
   with very low water holding capacity (0.13 cm(3)/cm(3)). The OPTRAM
   model estimated the SM at 15 and 25 cm yielding a R-2 >= 0.79 and RMSE
   <= 0.030 cm(3)/cm(3). The OPTRAM-derived SM was successfully used as
   input to compute and map the soil water deficit index, an indicator of
   agricultural drought. The results indicate that OPTRAM can provide

Abstract = {Accurate prediction of soil moisture spatial-temporal variations remains

   for landscape feature (e.g. topography, land use, vegetation) modelling.
   Innovative and effective approaches for accurate soil moisture

   particle size distribution, porosity, horizon, redox feature, and
   organic matter content, have been accepted as important factors
   controlling soil moisture and can be potentially used in soil moisture
   prediction. However, pedological properties mostly lack quantification
   (e. g. redox feature, horizon, soil structure), and soil sampling and
   analysis are time-consuming and costly, especially at large spatial
   scale. These limitations have restricted the utilisation of pedological
   information to predict soil moisture spatial-temporal variations at
   different spatial scales. To overcome these difficulties, new tools

Abstract = {Internet of Underground Things (IOUT) communications have the potential
   for soil properties estimation and soil moisture monitoring. In this
   paper, a method has been developed for real-time in situ estimation of
   relative permittivity of soil, and soil moisture, that is determined
   from the propagation path loss, and velocity of wave propagation of an
   underground (UG) transmitter and receiver link in wireless underground
   communications (WUC). The permittivity and soil moisture estimation
   processes (Di-Sense, where Di- prefix means two) are modeled and
   validated through an outdoor UG software-defined radio (SDR) testbed,
   and indoor greenhouse testbed. SDR experiments are conducted in the
   frequency range of 100-500 MHz, using antennas buried at 10 cm, 20 cm,
   30 cm, and 40 cm depths in different soils under different soil moisture
   levels, by using dipole antennas with over the air (OTA) resonant
   frequency of 433 MHz. Experiments are conducted in silt loam, silty clay
   loam, and sandy soils. By using Di-Sense approach, soil moisture and
   permittivity can be measured with high accuracy in 1-15 m distance range
   in plant root zone up to depth of 40 cm. The estimated soil parameters
   have less than 8\% estimation error from the ground truth measurements
   and semi-empirical dielectric mixing models. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {The value of satellite remote sensing soil moisture data and the
   DISPATCH algorithm in irrigation fields},
Journal = {HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {22},
Number = {11},
Pages = {5889-5900},
Month = {NOV 14},
Abstract = {Soil moisture measurements are needed in a large number of applications
   such as hydro-climate approaches, watershed water balance management and
   irrigation scheduling. Nowadays, different kinds of methodologies exist
   for measuring soil moisture. Direct methods based on gravimetric
   sampling or time domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques measure soil
   moisture in a small volume of soil at few particular locations. This
   typically gives a poor description of the spatial distribution of soil
   moisture in relatively large agriculture fields. Remote sensing of soil
   moisture provides widespread coverage and can overcome this problem but
   suffers from other problems stemming from its low spatial resolution. In
   this context, the DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale
   CHange (DISPATCH) algorithm has been proposed in the literature to
   downscale soil moisture satellite data from 40 to 1 km resolution by
   combining the low-resolution Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS)
   satellite soil moisture data with the high-resolution Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST)
   datasets obtained from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) sensor. In this work, DISPATCH estimations are compared with
   soil moisture sensors and gravimetric measurements to validate the
   DISPATCH algorithm in an agricultural field during two different
   hydrologic scenarios: wet conditions driven by rainfall events and wet
   conditions driven by local sprinkler irrigation. Results show that the
   DISPATCH algorithm provides appropriate soil moisture estimates during
   general rainfall events but not when sprinkler irrigation generates
   occasional heterogeneity. In order to explain these differences, we have
   examined the spatial variability scales of NDVI and LST data, which are
   the input variables involved in the downscaling process. Sample
   variograms show that the spatial scales associated with the NDVI and LST
   properties are too large to represent the variations of the average soil
   moisture at the site, and this could be a reason why the DISPATCH
   algorithm does not work properly in this field site.},

Title = {Mapping High-Resolution Soil Moisture over Heterogeneous Cropland Using
   Multi-Resource Remote Sensing and Ground Observations},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {High spatial resolution soil moisture (SM) data are crucial in
   agricultural applications, river-basin management, and understanding
   hydrological processes. Merging multi-resource observations is one of
   the ways to improve the accuracy of high spatial resolution SM data in
   the heterogeneous cropland. In this paper, the Bayesian Maximum Entropy
   (BME) methodology is implemented to merge the following four types of
   observed data to obtain the spatial distribution of SM at 100 m scale:
   soil moisture observed by wireless sensor network (WSN), Advanced
   Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)-derived
   soil evaporative efficiency (SEE), irrigation statistics, and
   Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR)-derived SM products
   (similar to 700 m). From the poor BME predictions obtained by merging
   only WSN and SEE data, we observed that the SM heterogeneity caused by
   irrigation and the attenuating sensitivity of the SEE data to SM caused
   by the canopies result in BME prediction errors. By adding irrigation
   statistics to the merged datasets, the overall RMSD of the BME
   predictions during the low-vegetated periods can be successively reduced
   from 0.052 m(3).m(-3) to 0.033 m(3).m(-3). The coefficient of
   determination (R-2) and slope between the predicted and in situ measured
   SM data increased from 0.32 to 0.64 and from 0.38 to 0.82, respectively,
   but large estimation errors occurred during the moderately vegetated
   periods (RMSD = 0.041 m(3.)m(-3), R = 0.43 and the slope = 0.41).
   Further adding the downscaled SM information from PLMR SM products to
   the merged datasets, the predictions were satisfactorily accurate with
   an RMSD of 0.034 m(3).m(-3), R-2 of 0.4 and a slope of 0.69 during
   moderately vegetated periods. Overall, the results demonstrated that
   merging multi-resource observations into SM estimations can yield
   improved accuracy in heterogeneous cropland.},

Abstract = {The primary goal of the SMOS mission is to deliver global fields of sea
   surface salinity and surface soil moisture using L-band (1.4 GHz)
   radiometry. Within the context of the preparation of SMOS activities
   over land, a field campaign, SMOSREX (Surface Monitoring Of the Soil
   Reservoir EXperiment), has been in operation since January 2001 in
   Mauzac, near Toulouse in France. Continuous ground measurements of
   meteorological variables, soil moisture and temperature profiles have
   been taken over bare soil and a grass plot left fallow. Since January
   2003, SMOSREX has been providing accurate field measurements of dual
   polarized L-band brightness temperature up-welling from both bare soil
   and fallow plots, together with multi-spectral (from visible to infrared
   frequencies) remote sensing surface data. The scientific objectives are
   presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental design is
   described. The experimental concept is totally new since (i) SMOSREX
   combines land-surface-atmosphere observations, passive microwave
   measurements and VIS to NIR remote sensing, (ii) SMOSREX is based on
   highly accurate L-band measurements carried out by a radiometer
   specifically designed for the experiment, and (iii) SMOSREX provides a
   unique continuous data set of L-band measurements over several years.
   The characteristics of the L-band emission are presented at diurnal,
   seasonal and annual temporal scales, and the emissions are compared over
   bare soil and natural grass. The surface emissions over bare soil and
   fallow area are shown to be counter-phased at the diurnal scale due to
   small variations in vegetation water content and bare soil surface
   moisture. Innovative long term results using L-band measurements for
   both bare soil and natural grass are presented in this paper, and the
   relationship between the surface emission at L-band and surface bare
   soil moisture is shown to be suitable for a long term period (19
   months). Soil freezing is shown to be drastically different for bare
   soil and vegetation covered plots, with a large threshold effect on
   microwave surface emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A linear physically-based model for remote sensing of soil moisture
   using short wave infrared bands},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {164},
Pages = {66-76},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Technological advances in satellite remote sensing have offered a
   variety of techniques for estimating surface soil water content as a key
   variable in numerous environmental studies. Optical methods are
   particularly valuable for remote sensing of soil moisture since
   reflected solar radiation is the strongest passive signal available to
   satellites and thus observations at optical wavelengths are capable of
   providing high spatial resolution data. Since remote sensors do not
   measure soil water content directly, mathematical algorithms that
   describe the connection between the measured signal and surface water
   content must be derived. Here, we present a physically-based soil
   moisture retrieval model in the solar domain (350-2500 nm) that is based
   on the Kubelka-Munk two-flux radiative transfer theory. The model is
   designed to describe diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically
   thick, absorbing and scattering medium. The theory suggests a linear
   relationship between a transformed reflectance and soil water content in
   the short wave infrared bands (e.g. band 7 of Landsat and MODIS
   satellites) providing an easy-to-use algorithm in these bands. Accuracy
   of this model was tested and preliminarily verified using
   laboratory-measured spectral reflectance data of different soils.
   Further studies on potentials and challenges of this model for
   large-scale application using optical satellites data remain a topic of
   ongoing research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ordination and hyperspectral remote sensing approach to classify
   peatland biotopes along soil moisture and fertility gradients},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {124},
Pages = {596-609},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Spatial information on biotopes would be an asset for boreal peatland
   inventories. It may be helpful for protection and monitoring changes in
   species diversity caused by artificial regulation of hydrology,
   atmospheric deposition, and global change. We took a data-driven
   approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in
   determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in
   Finland (65 degrees 57'N, 24 degrees 29'E). The objective was to produce
   an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level
   which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped
   with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class
   level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical
   correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate
   analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support
   vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain
   from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap
   data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant
   inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon),
   electrical conductivity (sigma), and pH. Constrained canonical
   correspondence ordination revealed that epsilon, sigma (p<0.01), and pH
   (p<0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were
   thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were
   distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum-Emperum nigrum-Rubus
   chamaemorus-S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum-S.
   lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa-Trichophorum
   cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre-S. majus-Carex rostrata-swamp. The
   highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8\%,
   kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10\% of the original training
   data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites
   from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector
   machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver
   operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good
   successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for
   bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of
   spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually
   changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from
   hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing
   support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous
   inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or
   national scales. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   the woody perennial component. Treatments, including Acacia saligna (A,
   AR, W and WR) increased SOM and NT stocks over time compared with the
   control, probably due to higher SOM and N inputs from the litter and
   root turnover. The treatments with water harvesting (AR and WR) showed
   the highest SOM and NT contents by 2008, suggesting that this practice
   had positive effects on water infiltration rates and soil water content
   in the soil, important parameters in the process of root turnover.
   However, there were no significant differences in other soil parameters,

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {166},
Pages = {175-187},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Surface soil moisture is a key variable for describing water and energy
   exchanges at the surface/atmosphere interface. The triangle or trapezoid
   method is appropriate for monitoring the regional surface soil moisture
   status. In this study, an advanced temperature vegetation dryness index
   (ATVDI) is used to monitor soil moisture status using an improved
   surface temperature and a vegetation index space that is formed by the
   theoretical dry edge determined by the surface energy balance principle
   and the wet edge extracted from water surface temperature. The ATVDI was
   validated by in situ soil moisture measurements from the Southern Great
   Plains (SGP) and is compared with a simple temperature vegetation
   dryness index (STVDI) estimated from the observed dry edge. The results
   indicate that the theoretical dry edge forms a trapezoid shape during
   the period of data coverage whereas the observed dry edge does not.
   Across all points, the R-2 of the ATVDI (0.35) is greater than that for
   the STVDI (0.28). For almost all of the sites, the R-2 between the ATVDI
   and soil moisture apparently improved. We also examined the spatial
   variation, and the value range of the ATVDI is closer than the STVDI to
   the real soil moisture conditions. The temporal variation of the ATVDI
   is closer to soil moisture than that of the STVDI, and the ATVDI is more
   sensitive to rainfall. This study demonstrates that a theoretical dry
   edge, determined by the energy balance principle, sets a standard for
   different days and that the ATVDI could monitor soil moisture conditions
   better than the STVDI could. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {A Method for Downscaling FengYun-3B Soil Moisture Based on Apparent
   Thermal Inertia},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {FengYun-3B (FY-3B) soil moisture product, retrieved from passive
   microwave brightness temperature data based on the Qp model, has rarely
   been applied at the catchment and region scale. One of the reasons for
   this is its coarse spatial resolution (25-km). The study in this paper
   presented a new method to obtain a high spatial resolution soil moisture
   product by downscaling FY-3B soil moisture product from 25-km to 1-km
   spatial resolution using the theory of Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI)
   under bare surface or sparse vegetation covered land surface. The
   relationship between soil moisture and ATI was first constructed, and
   the coefficients were obtained directly from 25-km FY-3B soil moisture
   product and ATI derived from MODIS data, which is different from
   previous studies often assuming the same set of coefficients applicable
   at different spatial resolutions. The method was applied to Naqu area on
   the Tibetan Plateau to obtain the downscaled 1-km resolution soil
   moisture product, the latter was validated using ground measurements
   collected from Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network on the
   central Tibetan Plateau (TP-STMNS) in 2012. The downscaled soil moisture
   showed promising results with a coefficient of determination R-2 higher
   than 0.45 and a root mean-square error (RMSE) less than 0.11 m(3)/m(3)
   when comparing with the ground measurements at 5 sites out of the 9
   selected sites. It was found that the accuracy of downscaled soil
   moisture was largely influenced by the accuracy of the FY-3B soil
   moisture product. The proposed method could be applied for both bare
   soil surface and sparsely vegetated surface.},

   provinces in Southwest China, were chosen to construct the LST-VI space,
   and then the spatial distribution of soil moisture in 5 provinces of
   Southwest China was monitored by the temperature vegetation dryness
   index (TVDI). Three LST-VI spaces were constructed by normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and
   modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), respectively. The
   correlations between the soil moisture data from 98 sites and the 3
   TVDIs calculated by LST-NDVI, LST-EVI and LST-MSAVI, respectively, were
   analyzed. The results showed that TVDI was a useful parameter for soil
   surface moisture conditions. The TVDI calculated from the LST-EVI space
   (TVDIE) revealed a better correlation with soil moisture than those
   calculated from the LST-NDVI and LST-MSAVI spaces. From the different
   stages of the TVDIE space, it is concluded that TVDIE can effectively
   show the temporal and spatial differences of soil moisture, and is an
   effective approach to monitor soil moisture condition.},

Abstract = {Accurate mapping of long-term global soil moisture is of great
   importance to earth science studies and a variety of applications. An
   approach for deriving volumetric soil moisture using satellite passive
   microwave radiometry from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for
   the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was developed in this study. Unlike
   the major AMSR-E retrieval algorithms that assume fixed scattering
   albedo values over the globe, the proposed algorithm adopts a weighted
   averaging strategy for soil moisture estimation based on a dynamic
   selection of albedo values that are empirically determined. The
   resulting soil moisture retrievals demonstrate more realistic global
   patterns and seasonal dynamics relative to the baseline University of
   Montana soil moisture product. Quantitative analysis of the new approach
   against in situ soil moisture measurements over four study regions also
   indicates improvements over the baseline algorithm, with coefficients of
   determination (R-2) between the retrievals and in situ measurements
   increasing by approximately 16.9\% and 41.5\% and bias-corrected
   root-mean-square errors decreasing by about 25.0\% and 38.2\% for
   ascending and descending orbital data records, respectively. The
   resulting algorithm is readily applied to similar microwave sensors,
   including the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, and its
   retrieval strategy is also applicable to other passive microwave
   sensors, including lower frequency (L-band) observations from the
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active
   Passive mission.},

   larger spatial decorrelation compared to in situ based soil moisture
   data. The precipitation storms drive the soil moisture spatial
   structures at large scale, found smaller decorrelation length after

Abstract = {The impacts of soil P leaching on water eutrophication have widely been
   concerned. However, there is no dependable method to quantitatively
   estimate the P leaching risk of soils. In this study, a simple soil
   column method was developed using two calcareous Fluvisols, silt loam
   and loam. The soil column was 20cm in length and 5cm in diameter, and
   distilled water was continuously supplied from the top. The volume and
   dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations of leachate were measured.
   Results showed that DRP concentrations in leachate increased slowly for
   the low soil Olsen-P levels but rapidly for the high Olsen-P levels.
   According to these two-phase changes in the DRP versus soil Olsen-P
   contents, the thresholds of P leaching risk were estimated to be 41.1
   and 62.3mgPkg(-1) (Olsen-P) for silt loam and loam, respectively. The P
   leaching intensity of soils increased by 3- to 540-fold if the soil
   Olsen-P contents accumulated from 6.6 to 155.5mgPkg(-1). The outcomes
   derived from this study regarding the determination of P leaching

Abstract = {With the goal of an effective method for calibrating dielectric soil
   moisture sensors that can be implemented rapidly, the applicability of a
   two-point alpha-mixing model was examined for a variety of sensor types.
   A large number of sensor outputs (X) were taken for four different types
   of ECH2O soil moisture sensors under varying volumetric water contents
   (theta) using four test sands with various grain sizes. The two-point
   alpha-mixing model was fitted to the X-theta data and a fitting
   parameter, alpha, was determined for each sensor type. Two other widely
   used sensors, the CS616 and the ThetaProbe ML2x, were also tested using
   the calibration functions and data provided by the manufacturers,
   including data for a soil with high electrical conductivity. For the
   sensors tested in this study, the effects of sensor characteristics were
   lumped into alpha. The value of alpha was 1.0 to 4.6, generally with
   high r(2) values. Some of these were as accurate as polynomial models
   that require a large number of X-theta data. After the alpha value is
   fitted for a specific sensor type, the two-point alpha-mixing model
   requires only the measurement of porosity and two extreme X values,
   i.e., sensor outputs in dry and saturated soils, and does not require
   soil samples with intermediate water content. Therefore, the two-point
   alpha-mixing model can be considered as an alternative method for
   calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors, especially when porosity
   is known with small uncertainty such as relatively homogeneous field or
   laboratory experiments.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture determination plays a major role in water and crop

   was evaluated to predict surface soil moisture content using Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) satellite images with 1km
   resolution. The investigation was carried out within an area of 76 km(2)
   in Lighavn watershed in East Azerbaijan, North West of Iran. The
   analysis was based on ground measurements of soil moisture at 225 points
   (45 pixels) across the catchment on 2 different days. Ground
   measurements from the first day were used to train the models, while
   those from the second day were used for validation. A range of
   polynomial regressions from 1st to 4th orders were established between
   the ground measured soil moisture and MODIS Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST). The best
   results were obtained for the 4th order polynomial of the TM with the

   criterions, respectively, equal to 11.0\% and 0.63 for calibration and
   15.9\% and 0.60 for validation stage. Therefore, the TM was found to

   are carried out by using the same set of training and test data for each
   method. The methodologies have been applied to two sets of data to
   retrieve SM from bare soils and to verify their accuracy. One data set
   contains scatterometer and radiometer data acquired on a variety of
   agricultural fields in different polarizations, frequencies, and
   incidence angles. The other is made up of five experiments carried out
   with a C-band scatterometer on rough and smooth soils at different
   polarizations and incidence angles. There are significant similarities
   in the performance of each method; they both retrieve the same features
   and trends in the analyzed data sets. Algorithm performances change
   according to SM level and data configuration. The main difficulties are
   found in retrieving low SM values, and in this case, the error on
   estimates is reduced when the data with two polarizations or two
   incidence angles are inserted in the inversion procedure. One major
   difference between the methodologies is that the NN performance
   improves, with respect to the Bayesian method, when more inputs are

Abstract = {Encroachment of pinyon-juniper woodland into rangeland ecosystems is
   prevalent across the western United States. Mechanisms associated with
   this successful encroachment are speculative, but probably, in part,
   involve the effective use of water resources. We explored the
   ecohydrological characteristics of a two-needle pinyon pine (Pinus
   edulis Engelm.)-Utah juniper {[}Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little]
   woodland on the Colorado Plateau in Utah. We have discovered that a high
   level of natural soil water repellency or hydrophobicity exists under
   the canopies of both pinyon and juniper species. We found, following
   summer precipitation events, that soil water repellency tinder trees
   concentrated the soil water below the surface through finger flow or
   bypass infiltration, contrasting with piston flow and much more uniform
   soil wetting in intercanopy locations. We propose that the trees
   ``engineer{''} their environment, creating water repellency as a way of
   providing an ecohydrological advantage and reducing potential water
   uptake by shallow-rooted herbaceous species. In addition, we speculate
   that soil water repellency may be a major contributing factor to the
   ``nutrient islands{''} observed to persist under juniper canopies even
   after the trees have been cut down and removed.},

Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Understanding the spatial variation of soil water content and its
   relation with hydraulic properties is important for the application of
   hydrologic models. In this study, we investigated whether soil hydraulic
   properties are related to soil water content variability at the field
   scale. We used the mean relative difference ( MRD) of soil water content
   and saturation degree to describe the spatial soil water content
   variability of a 2- yr time series of soil water content measured with a
   sensor network at 41 locations in the Rollesbroich catchment ( Germany).
   Hydraulic properties were described by the van Genuchten- Mualem ( VGM)
   model and were estimated by inverse modeling of soil water content data
   using the Hydrus- 1D model for each location. The feasible parameter
   space for the inverse modeling was derived using the Rosetta
   pedotransfer functions from information on sand, silt, and clay contents
   and bulk density from 273 soil samples taken in the catchment. Our
   inverse modeling results were able to reproduce the observed time series
   of soil water content with a root mean square error < 0.08 cm3 cm- 3 and
   R2 > 0.75. We found that the MRDs of soil water content were positively
   correlated with the saturated water content ( qs) and shape- fitting n
   parameters and negatively correlated with the shape- fitting a and
   saturated hydraulic conductivity ( Ks) parameters of the VGM model.
   Moreover, the MRDs of the saturation degree were strongly correlated
   with the a and n parameters that determine the shape of the VGM model.},

Abstract = {We propose an operational definition of soil ``fertility{''} that is
   applicable to plant community ecology and develop a method of measuring
   and quantifying it, using structural equations modeling, that is
   generalizable to soils in different regions whose fertility has
   different causes. To do this, we used structural equation modeling
   (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent ``generalized
   fertility,{''} F-G, of a soil using four indicator variables: the
   relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum
   aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of F-G in this
   study were the supply rates of NO3-, P, and K as well as three indirect
   causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can
   change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland
   soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using
   aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation
   over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM
   fit the data well. The F-G values predicted 51\% of the variance in NPP
   and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including
   the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied
   to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the
   causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.},

Title = {Evaluation of the heat pulse probe method for determining frozen soil
   moisture content},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {47},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {Heat pulse probes (HPP) have been widely utilized to determine soil
   thermal properties and water content in unfrozen soils; however, their
   applications in frozen soils are largely restricted by phase change and
   the presence of unfrozen water. This study explores the possibility of
   using HPP to determine total water content of frozen soils by (1)
   establishing the optimum heat applications to limit melting, (2)
   improving the mathematical representations for frozen conditions, and
   (3) evaluating the applicability of HPP methods under various
   temperature and moisture conditions. A custom-built HPP was tested at
   total moisture levels that varied from full saturation to oven dry and
   initial soil temperatures from 20 degrees C to -11 degrees C. The
   applied heat pulse durations varied from 8 to 60 s, with total heat
   strength varying from 100 to 2000 J m(-1). Comparison of mathematical
   methods involved two analytical solutions and a one-dimensional finite
   difference numerical model. While both analytical methods assumed no
   phase change, the numerical model considered ice melting and unfrozen
   water. Conclusions include the following: (1) the numerical model with
   phase change is the only appropriate method to represent the temperature
   change curve once melting occurs; (2) below -4 degrees C, ice melting
   could be limited, and measurement errors of total moisture content were
   within +/-0.05 m(3) m(-3); (3) application of HPP between -2 degrees C
   and 0 degrees C is difficult because of the retarded response of probe
   temperature to changing moisture contents and heat applications; and (4)
   probe spacing is a sensitive parameter requiring calibration once
   reinstallation of the probe or the thawing and freezing process occurs.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a critical role in improving the weather and climate
   forecast and understanding terrestrial ecosystem processes. It is a key
   hydrologic variable in agricultural drought monitoring, flood
   forecasting, and irrigation management as well. Satellite retrievals can
   provide unprecedented soil moisture information at the global scale;
   however, the products are generally provided at coarse resolutions
   (25-50km(2)). This often hampers their use in regional or local studies.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched in January 2015 aiming to
   acquire soil moisture and freeze-thaw states over the globe with 2 to
   3days revisit frequency. This work presents a new framework based on an
   ensemble learning method while using atmospheric and geophysical
   information derived from remote-sensing and ground-based observations to
   downscale the level 3 daily composite version (L3\_SM\_P) of SMAP
   radiometer soil moisture over the Continental United States at 1-km
   spatial resolution. In the proposed method, a suite of remotely sensed
   and in situ data sets are used, including soil texture and topography
   data among other information. The downscaled product was validated
   against in situ soil moisture measurements collected from two high
   density validation sites and 300 sparse soil moisture networks
   throughout the Continental United States. On average, the unbiased Root
   Mean Square Error between the downscaled SMAP soil moisture data and
   in-situ soil moisture observations adequately met the SMAP soil moisture
   retrieval accuracy requirement of 0.04m(3)/m(3). In addition, other
   statistical measures, that is, Pearson correlation coefficient and bias,
   showed satisfactory results.},

   crucial for maximizing their utility in research and applications in
   hydro-meteorology and climatology. It can provide insights for retrieval
   development and validation, and inform suitable strategies for data
   fusion and assimilation. Su et al. (2013a) proposed a potential Fourier
   method for quantifying the errors based on the difference between the
   empirical power spectra of these SM data and a water balance model via
   spectral fitting (SF), circumventing the need for any ancillary data
   This work first evaluates its utility by estimating the errors in two
   passive and active microwave satellite SM over Australia, and comparing
   the results against the triple collocation (TC) estimator. The SF
   estimator shows very good agreement with TC in terms of error standard
   deviation and signal-to-noise ratio, with strong linear correlations of
   0.80-0.92 but with lower error estimates. As the two estimators are not
   strictly comparable, their strong agreement suggests a strong
   complementarity between time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of
   errors. A better understanding of the spectral characteristics of the
   error is still needed to understand their differences. Next, spatial
   analyses of the derived (SF and TC) error maps, in terms of error
   standard deviation and noise-to-signal ratio, for the two satellite data
   are performed with principal component analysis to identify influence of
   vegetation/leaf-area index (LAI), rainfall, soil wetness, and spatial
   heterogeneity in topography and soil type on retrieval errors. Lastly,
   seasonal analysis of the errors discovers systematic temporal
   variability in errors due to variability in rainfall amount, and less so
   with changing LAI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Measurement depth of the cosmic ray soil moisture probe affected by
   hydrogen from various sources},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {We present here a simple and robust framework for quantifying the
   effective sensor depth of cosmic ray soil moisture neutron probes such
   that reliable water fluxes may be computed from a time series of cosmic
   ray soil moisture. In particular, we describe how the neutron signal
   depends on three near-surface hydrogen sources: surface water, soil
   moisture, and lattice water (water in minerals present in soil solids)
   and also their vertical variations. Through a combined modeling study of
   one-dimensional water flow in soil and neutron transport in the
   atmosphere and subsurface, we compare average water content between the
   simulated soil moisture profiles and the universal calibration equation
   which is used to estimate water content from neutron counts. By using a
   linear sensitivity weighting function, we find that during evaporation
   and drainage periods the RMSE of the two average water contents is
   0.0070 m(3) m(-3) with a maximum deviation of 0.010 m(3) m(-3) for a
   range of soil types. During infiltration, the RMSE is 0.011 m(3) m(-3)
   with a maximum deviation of 0.020 m(3) m(-3), where piston like flow
   conditions exists for the homogeneous isotropic media. Because piston
   flow is unlikely during natural conditions at the horizontal scale of
   hundreds of meters that is measured by the cosmic ray probe, this
   modeled deviation of 0.020 m(3) m(-3) represents the worst case scenario
   for cosmic ray sensing of soil moisture. Comparison of cosmic ray soil
   moisture data and a distributed sensor soil moisture network in Southern
   Arizona indicates an RMSE of 0.011 m(3) m(-3) over a 6 month study
   period.},

Abstract = {This study presented a novel method to determine the volume of

   of the dielectric properties between soil drying-wetting and

   tube type and one cone type) with sandy silt loam samples at a middle
   level of soil moisture content (theta(v) = 0.20 cm(3) cm(-3)), (ii) the

   ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 cm and those of the tube-type sensor from 5.1 to

Abstract = {Field monitoring of soil moisture and groundwater level is important to
   predict shallow slope failure stemming from heavy rainfall. We
   previously proposed a monitoring technique using ultrasonic waveguides
   in which soil moisture and groundwater levels are monitored on the basis
   of the intensity and propagation time of ultrasonic waves reflected from
   the underground soil surface, respectively. In field monitoring, the
   reflective intensity depends on the depth of monitoring points and the
   inhomogeneity of grains, so it has been difficult to examine the
   reflective intensity change quantitatively. In the present work, we
   propose improvements that will allow us to measure the intensity change
   quantitatively. Specifically, we utilize an ultrasonic waveguide of a
   constant length by using casing pipes with different lengths depending
   on the monitoring depth and cover the surface of coarse-grained soil
   with a homogeneous fine soil to obtain repeatable data for wetting and
   drying cycles. The positive effects of these improvements were confirmed
   by a field monitoring test. (C) 2015 The Japan Society of Applied

Abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry
   (GNSS-IR) is a new remote-sensing technique, and it can be used to
   estimate near-surface soil moisture from Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
   data. Considering the effects of vegetation changes on GNSS-IR in some
   environments, a non-linear inversion method for soil moisture is
   proposed. Firstly, the SNR data and satellite elevation angles are
   solved using Translation, Editing, and Quality Checking. The direct and
   reflected signals are separated using a low-order polynomial; then, a
   sinusoidal fitting model of the reflection signal is established; it is
   used to obtain the amplitude and phase of the SNR interferogram.
   Finally, an estimation model of vegetation water content and prediction
   model of the vegetation phase changes are established to modify the
   original phase and weaken the influence on the vegetation changes. Based
   on the corrected phase, a Genetic Algorithm Back Propagation Neural
   Network (BPNN) model is established for soil moisture inversion.
   According to the GPS monitoring data from the Plate Boundary Observatory
   H2O network, the experiment indicates that (1) The BPNN is introduced to
   inverse the soil moisture content, and the non-linear fitting ability of
   the model is well developed, and the fitting process is stable; (2) the
   modified phase effectively reduced the effects of vegetation changes on
   the soil moisture inversion. The correlation coefficient (r) between the
   inversion results and soil moisture value greatly improved, and the root
   mean square error and mean absolute error are less than 0.060 and 0.050,
   respectively. Therefore, the soil moisture problem can be treated as a
   non-linear event, and the algorithm is feasible and effective.},

Abstract = {Many contract swine producers are located in the southeastern U.S. In
   this region almost all of the swine effluent from swine production is
   applied to warm-season perennial species such as bermudagrass {[}Cynodon
   dactylon (L.) Pers.] which is widely grown for summer grazing and hay
   production. A 3-yr study was conducted to investigate the impact of
   forage double-cropping on nutrient accumulation and leaching in
   Mantachie fine loam soil fertilized with swine (Sus scrofa domesticus)
   lagoon effluent as the source of plant nutrients. Plots of previously
   established Tifton 44 bermudagrass were overseeded in the fall with one
   of four winter annuals: berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.);
   crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.); ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.); or
   wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four plots of bermudagrass were not
   overseeded and considered as control. Plots were harvested in spring for
   cool-season annual hay and in summer for bermudagrass hay. Swine
   effluent was applied during spring and summer on a need base. Suction
   lysimeters were installed in selected plots at two depths to monitor
   nutrient leaching. Surface soil samples were taken to determine baseline
   nutrient contents, followed by three other sampling dates during the
   study. Bermudagrass dry matter production (3-yr average = 9.8 Mg ha(-1))
   was not adversely affected by the overseeding treatments. Greatest dry
   matter production was achieved with bermudagrass overseeded with
   ryegrass (3-yr average = 11.3 Mg ha(-1)). Soil pH decreased by almost
   one unit by the end of the study. While total P (TP) did not change
   much, Mehlich-3 P (M3-P), K, Cu, and Zn increased significantly, Mg and
   Mn concentrations decreased by 2002 compared to the baseline levels.
   Soil P, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, and Zn accumulation were greater under
   bermudagrass/wheat combination. In general, the influence of double
   cropping on soil nutrient accumulation was not conclusive, however, this
   practice provides the year-round green forage for grazing and haying.
   Nutrient concentrations in soil and lysimeter leachate were directly
   related to the quantity of effluent applied. Results also demonstrated
   that effluent application must be coordinated with the nutrient
   requirements of the growing forages in order to minimize accumulation
   and leaching.},

Journal = {PLANT ECOLOGY},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {213},
Number = {11},
Pages = {1803-1812},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Heterogeneity in soil resources is common in natural communities, in
   both space and time. In contrast to substantial research into plant
   responses to spatial nutrient heterogeneity, little is known about the
   factors that influence plants responses to temporally heterogeneous
   nutrient supplies. We examine (1) the effects of nutrient pulse length
   on plant biomass allocation patterns, (2) whether a plant's root system
   prior to a nutrient pulse influences the benefit a plant can gain from
   that pulse, and (3) how competition and nutrient pulses interact to
   influence plant biomass. To address these issues, we used a pot
   experiment with varying initial conditions (nutrient levels and
   competition) designed to produce a range of root system sizes in the
   grass Poa pratensis. We then subjected the plants to short-term (3 and
   10 days long) nutrient pulses where the same total nutrients were
   delivered at varying rates per unit time (intensity). Plant biomass and
   tissue nitrogen concentration were lowest when pulses were short
   relative to either long pulses or continuous supply. Plants with larger
   root systems at the start of the nutrient pulse gained more benefit than
   smaller plants because final plant size relative to initial root system
   size decreased as pulse intensity (nutrients delivered per unit time)
   increased. This study has two important implications. First, since
   larger plants benefit disproportionately more from a nutrient pulse than
   smaller plants, pre-pulse conditions such as the competitive environment
   and resource supply are likely key determinants of a plant's ability to
   capture nutrients from a pulse. Second, the importance of pre-pulse size
   provides a belowground mechanism to enhance the size variability among
   plants in a community.},

   of groundwater recharge from precipitation and groundwater loss due to

   Statistical results from lysimeter measurements reveal influences of
   vegetation, depth to groundwater, and soil moisture content on

Title = {Design and performance of a wireless sensor network for catchment-scale
   snow and soil moisture measurements},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed as part of a water balance
   instrument cluster across a forested 1 km(2) headwater catchment in the
   southern Sierra Nevada of California. The network, which integrates
   readings from over 300 sensors, provides spatially representative
   measurements of snow depth, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil
   moisture, and matric potential. The ability of this densely instrumented
   watershed to capture catchment- scale snow depth and soil moisture
   distributions is investigated through comparison with three
   comprehensive gridded surveys and 1 day of detailed lidar snow data.
   Statistical analysis shows that the network effectively characterized
   catchment-wide distributions of snow depth, while offering a
   cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient means for collecting
   distributed data in real time. A temporal analysis of snow depth
   variability reveals that canopy cover is the major explanatory variable
   of snow depth and that under-canopy measurements persistently show
   higher variability compared to those in open terrain. An analysis of
   soil moisture shows lower variability at deeper soil depth and a
   correlation between mean soil moisture and variability for shallow
   soils. A three-phase design procedure was used to optimize the WSN
   deployment. First, as off-the-shelf performance of current WSN platforms
   for large-scale, long-term deployments cannot be guaranteed, statistics
   from a prototype deployment were analyzed. Two indicators of network
   performance, the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength
   indicator, showed that for our site conditions, a conservative 50 m
   node-to-node spacing would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust
   network communications. Second, results from the prototype were used to
   refine hardware specifications and to guide the layout of the full
   57-node wireless network. Of these nodes, 23 were used actively for
   sensing, while the remaining 34 nodes were used as signal repeaters to
   ensure proper spatial radio coverage and robust network operations.
   Further analysis of network statistics is conducted during the third,
   operational, phase to validate system performance.},

Abstract = {This paper introduces a new concept for a smart wireless sensor web
   technology for optimal measurements of surface-to-depth profiles of soil
   moisture using in-situ sensors. The objective of the technology,
   supported by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office Advanced
   Information Systems Technology program, is to enable a guided and
   adaptive sampling strategy for the in-situ sensor network to meet the
   measurement validation objectives of spaceborne soil moisture sensors. A
   potential application for this technology is the validation of products
   from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission. Spatially, the
   total variability in soil-moisture fields comes from variability in
   processes on various scales. Temporally, variability is caused by
   external forcings, landscape heterogeneity, and antecedent conditions.
   Installing a dense in-situ network to sample the field continuously in
   time for all ranges of variability is impractical. However, a sparser
   but smarter network with an optimized measurement schedule can provide
   the validation estimates by operating in a guided fashion with guidance
   from its own sparse measurements. The feedback and control take place in
   the context of a dynamic physics-based hydrologic and sensor modeling
   system. The overall design of the smart sensor web-including the control
   architecture, physics-based hydrologic and sensor models, and actuation
   and communication hardware-is presented in this paper. We also present
   results illustrating sensor scheduling and estimation strategies as well
   as initial numerical and field demonstrations of the sensor web concept.
   It is shown that the coordinated operation of sensors through the
   control policy results in substantial savings in resource usage.},

   devices used for a variety of applications but require site-specific
   calibrations to provide accurate measurements. Several calibration
   techniques have been reported in the literature, although
   laboratory-based procedures involving wet-up (via upward or downward
   infiltration) and dry-down are commonly performed for permanently
   installed sensors. Wet-up calibrations can be completed substantially
   faster (<1 d) than dry-down calibrations (1-2 wk), but it is uncertain
   which technique is preferable to provide the most accurate calibration.
   The objective of this study was to compare the results obtained from
   laboratory-based infiltration wet-up and dry-down calibrations of the
   Stevens Hydra Probe soil moisture sensor. Soil samples for this study
   were obtained from agricultural sites in Saskatchewan, Canada, at depths
   of 5, 20, and 50 cm across a variety of textural compositions. Results
   demonstrate that utilizing either infiltration wet-up (according to the
   procedure in this study) or dry-down procedures provides accuracies of <
   0.061 m(3) m(-3) root mean square error (RMSE), which was superior to
   manufacturer calibration accuracy across all samples. However, superior
   calibration accuracies (i.e., the lowest RMSE) were achieved using the
   dry-down procedure across all soil samples, resulting in a lower RMSE of
   0.01 to 0.04 m(3) m(-3) (at 95\% confidence). A significant c orrelation
   (r value = 0.61, p < 0.05) exists between the differences in
   infiltration wet-up and dry-down calibration RMSEs and clay content.
   This suggests that the difference between the two procedures tested in
   this study is more significant in finer textured soils. The findings of
   this study indicate that the dry-down procedure produced the lowest RMSE
   and is therefore the preferred calibration procedure, particularly for
   finer textured soils.},

Abstract = {Soil water content is one of the critical and dynamic factors for
   controlling many processes in plant growth and understanding
   agricultural drought status. It also influences the management of water.
   Unfortunately, it hasn't been a routinely measured variable in the
   world, yet. Therefore, this variable is subject to be estimated using
   related approaches. In this study, an artificial neural network (ANN), a
   suitable adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and a multiple
   linear regression (MLR) model were applied and compared for modeling the
   variation in the measured soil water content for a vegetated surface by
   meteorological and plant factors such as air temperature, relative
   humidity, vapor pressure deficit, precipitation and leaf area index.
   Measurements were carried out over an irrigated field. The results
   indicated that the best determination coefficient (r(2)=0.98) between
   the measured soil water content and all considered variables was
   estimated by the ANFIS, whereas weaker relationships were calculated
   between the same variables by MLR as r(2)=0.38 and ANN as r(2)=0.56.
   Comparisons showed that ANFIS approach had a better modeling potential
   of the soil water content compared to the MLR and ANN model in the trial
   period, though weaker relationships in the testing period were found by
   all approaches.},

Abstract = {Assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management
   and planning, particularly in water-limited regions. Here, we present a
   biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and
   root-zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological
   data (Crop RS-Met). The model, which is based on the dual FAO56
   formulation, uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and
   atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration
   and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions. We tested
   the Crop RS-Met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a
   variety of wheat (Tridcum aestivum L. and T. durum) cultivars with
   diverse phenology. Crop RS-Met was shown to accurately capture seasonal
   changes in wheat water use during the growing season. The average R-2 of
   modeled vs. observed soil water content for all cultivars (N = 11) was
   0.92 0.02 with average relative RMSE and bias of 9.29 1.30\% and 0.13
   0.03\%, respectively. We found that changing the integration time period
   of the water deficit factor in Crop RS-Met affects the accuracy of the
   model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water
   use under dry conditions. Currently, Crop RS-Met has a simple
   representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration
   heterogeneity in the soil profile. Thus, efforts to combine numerical
   models that simulate soil water dynamics with a Crop RS-Met model driven
   by high-resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially
   continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex
   edaphic characteristics.},

Abstract = {Commercial-scale integrated crop-livestock systems intensify land use by
   combining complementary agricultural enterprises and leveraging
   synergistic ecosystem services to achieve both productive and
   environmental outcomes. Although widely implemented in southern Brazil
   as an annual beef/soybean rotation, tradeoffs such as competing soil
   water use between pasture and crop phases may result from seasonal
   grazing in this system. We compared soil water and plant physiological
   variables in the crop phase of an integrated annual beef-soybean system
   managed with no-till and best grazing practices with those of an
   ungrazed cover crop control as part of a long-term experiment in
   southern Brazil. A mixed black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and Italian
   ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) pasture was either grazed by beef
   cattle to 20-cm sward height or left as an ungrazed cover crop in the
   winter, and direct-planted to soybean (Glycine max {[}L.] Merr.) in the
   summer. Although soybean yields did not differ between grazed and
   ungrazed treatments, soil matric potential was on average 25\% lower
   across depths and growth stages in plots that had been grazed during
   winter. Soybeans in grazed plots also exhibited up to 34\% lower
   light-use efficiency and a 2-week slower time to physiological
   maturation than soybeans in plots that had not been previously grazed.
   These results describe for the first time the differential crop growing
   conditions and crop physiological responses created after 16 years of
   integration with grazing animals. As integrated crop-livestock systems
   grow in importance in commercial production settings, this research can
   inform adaptive management practices to ensure the sustainability of
   these systems into the future and under a variety of environmental
   conditions.},

Abstract = {The estimation of topsoil water content is of primary interest in the
   framework of precision fanning, but, in general, such assessment is
   costly and complicated by several interfering factors which do not allow
   an accurate prediction. Proximal sensing can provide suitable
   technological facilities to support researchers and technicians in this
   task. GPR and EMI sensors are valuable instruments as they can provide
   very informative covariates to be used for improving soil water content
   estimation. In the present work, it was explored the single (EMI or GPR)
   and the combined (EMI + GPR) contribution of these proximal data
   sources. Furthermore, geostatistical (Ordinary Kriging and Kriging with
   external drift) and linear mixed effects models were applied to compare
   their respective predictive capabilities. As a result, GPR demonstrated
   to be more effective in estimating topsoil water content with respect to
   EMI but, combining both the information, an improvement in the
   prediction accuracy was observed. Moreover, adding more covariates in
   the models (GPR outcomes or GPR + EMI outcomes) allowed filtering out
   the structured spatial component of soil water content. Finally, the
   statistical approaches proved to behave very similarly, with a slight
   better performance of Kriging with external drift.},

Abstract = {Drought is a significant disaster in Beijing and it is important to find
   a method to assess the drought condition. First, this paper collected
   data of 85 soil monitoring stations in Beijing, such as soil dry bulk
   densities, saturated water contents, field capacities. Then, spatial
   variability characteristics of soil physics parameters were investigated
   by GIS and other three factors, 10 cm soil moisture content, organic
   matter and saturated water content which notably influenced soil
   moisture were extracted by Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
   Furthermore, four different nonlinear methods were put forward to
   predict crop-root zone soil water. 15555 single daily data from 2011
   were used in parameters determination, while 15470 double daily data
   were used to test. The result showed that the Least Square Support

Pages = {402-414},
Abstract = {The sustainability of the wheat-maize rotation is important to China's
   food security. Intensive cropping without recycling crop residues or
   other organic inputs results in the loss of soil organic matter (SOM)
   and nutrients, and is assumed to be non-sustainable. We evaluated the
   effects of nine different treatments on yields, nitrogen use efficiency,
   P and K balances, and soil fertility in a wheat-maize rotation system
   (1991-2010) on silt clay loam in Shaanxi, China. The treatments involved
   the application of recommended dose of nitrogen (N), nitrogen and
   phosphorus (NP), nitrogen and potassium (NK), phosphorus and potassium
   (PK), combined NPK, wheat or maize straw (S) with NPK (SNPK), or dairy
   manure (M) with NPK (M1NPK and M2NPK), along with an un-treated control
   treatment (CK). The mean yields of wheat and maize ranged from 992 and 2
   235 kg ha(-1) under CK to 5 962 and 6 894 kg ha(-1) under M2NPK
   treatment, respectively. Treatments in which either N or P was omitted
   (N, NK and PK) gave significantly lower crop yields than those in which
   both were applied. The crop yields obtained under NP, NPK and SNPK
   treatments were statistically identical, as were those obtained under
   SNPK and MNPK. However, M2NPK gave a significant higher wheat yield than
   NP, and MNPK gave significant higher maize yield than both NP and NPK.
   Wheat yields increased significantly (by 86 to 155 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in
   treatments where NP was applied, but maize yields did not. In general,
   the nitrogen use efficiency of wheat was the highest under the NP and
   NPK treatments; for maize, it was the highest under MNPK treatment. The
   P balance was highly positive under MNPK treatment, increasing by 136 to
   213 kg ha(-1) annually. While the K balance was negative in most
   treatments, ranging from 31 to 217 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), levels of soil
   available K remained unchanged or increased over the 20 yr. SOM levels
   increased significantly in all treatments. Overall, the results
   indicated that combinations of organic manure and inorganic nitrogen, or
   returning straw with NP is likely to improve soil fertility, increasing
   the yields achievable with wheat-maize system in a way which is
   environmentally and agronomically beneficial on the tested soil.},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture is often necessary in hydrological studies on
   various scales. One of the challenges is to determine the mean soil
   moisture of large areas with minimum tabour and costs. The aim of this
   study is to test temporal persistence of sample locations to decrease
   the number of samples required to make reliable estimates of mean
   moisture content in the top soil. Soil moisture data on four
   experimental sites were collected during the vegetation period in
   2004-2006. The experimental sites are located in a steppe environment in
   northern China, and are characterised by different grazing management
   which causes differences in vegetation cover. A total of 100 sampling
   points per site were ranked with respect to their difference to field
   mean soil moisture using the time-stability concept. We tested whether:
   (a) representative sample locations exist that predict field mean soil
   moisture to an acceptable degree, and (b) these locations are
   time-stable beyond a single vegetation period. Time-stable locations
   with a low deviation from mean field soil moisture and tow standard
   deviation were identified for each site. Although the time-stability
   characteristics of some points varied between years, the selected points
   were appropriate to predict mean soil moisture of the sites for multiple
   years. On the field scale, time-stability and the persistence of
   patterns were analysed by the use of a Spearman rank correlation. The
   analysis showed that persistence depended on grazing management and the
   related plant cover. It is concluded that the time-stability concept
   provides useful information for the validation of hydrological or remote
   sensing models, or for the upscaling of soil moisture information to
   larger scales. A preliminary comparison of soil moisture measurements
   derived from ground-truth and remote sensing data showed that the data
   matched well in some cases, but that the considerable difference in
   spatial extent promotes differences in other cases. (C) 2008 Elsevier

Abstract = {Precise nutrient management across claypan soil landscapes requires an

   properties and nutrient buffering. Therefore, a study was performed at
   the Central Mississippi River Basin site of the USDA Long-Term

   claypan (DTC), cropping system (CS), and landscape position (LP) affect
   soil properties, and whether accounting for these factors could improve
   fertility management. Treatments consisted of five CS \{MTCS, mulch till
   corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean {[}Glycine max (L.) Merr.]; NTCS, no-till
   corn-soybean; NTCSW, no-till corn-soybean-wheat (Triticum aestivum

   cool and warm-season hay\} and three LP (summit, backslope, and
   footslope), each with a distinct DTC. Soil test P (STP) was 9 kg P
   ha(-1) greater on footslopes than summits. Soil test K (STK) and soil
   organic matter content (SOM) were greatest on backslopes and averaged
   384 kg K ha(-1) and 20 g kg(-1), respectively, Soil test P was >= 49\%
   and STK was >= 10\% lower in NTCSW than in MTCS or NTCS. However, crop
   diversity in NTCSW maintained STP and increased SOM 2 g kg(-1) over
   MTCS. Soil test P, pHs, and SOM were similar between CCRP and HAY, while
   STK in CCRP was greater at all LP. Lastly, deeper DTC caused greater P
   buffering and less K buffering than shallower DTC. These results
   indicate that eroded sideslopes with shallow DTC likely need more or
   more frequent P and less K than other LP.},

Abstract = {Spatially correlated errors are typically ignored in data assimilation,
   thus degenerating the observation error covariance R to a diagonal
   matrix. We argue that a nondiagonal R carries more observation
   information making assimilation results more accurate. A method, denoted
   TC\_Cov, was proposed for soil moisture data assimilation to estimate
   spatially correlated observation error covariance based on triple
   collocation (TC). Assimilation experiments were carried out to test the
   performance of TC\_Cov. AMSR-E soil moisture was assimilated with a
   diagonal R matrix computed using the TC and assimilated using a
   nondiagonal R matrix, as estimated by proposed TC\_Cov. The ensemble
   Kalman filter was considered as the assimilation method. Our
   assimilation results were validated against climate change initiative
   data and ground-based soil moisture measurements using the Pearson
   correlation coefficient and unbiased root mean square difference
   metrics. These experiments confirmed that deterioration of diagonal R
   assimilation results occurred when model simulation is more accurate
   than observation data. Furthermore, nondiagonal R achieved higher
   correlation coefficient and lower ubRMSD values over diagonal R in
   experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness of TC\_Cov to estimate
   richly structuralized R in data assimilation. In sum, compared with
   diagonal R, nondiagonal R may relieve the detrimental effects of
   assimilation when simulated model results outperform observation data.

Title = {Detecting and analyzing soil phosphorus loss associated with critical
   source areas using a remote sensing approach},

Abstract = {The detection of critical source areas (CSAs) is a key step in managing
   soil phosphorus (P) loss and preventing the long-term eutrophication of
   water bodies at regional scale. Most related studies, however, focus on
   a local scale, which prevents a clear understanding of the spatial
   distribution of CSAs for soil P loss at regional scale. Moreover, the
   continual, long-term variation in CSAs was scarcely reported. It is
   impossible to identify the factors driving the variation in CSAs, or to
   collect land surface information essential for CSAs detection, by merely
   using the conventional methodologies at regional scale. This study
   proposes a new regional-scale approach, based on three satellite sensors
   (ASTER, TM/ETM and MODIS), that were implemented successfully to detect
   CSAs at regional scale over 15 years (2000-2014). The approach
   incorporated five factors (precipitation, slope, soil erosion, land use,
   soil total phosphorus) that drive soil P loss from CSAs. Results show
   that the average area of critical phosphorus source areas (CPSAs) was
   15,056 km(2) over the 15-year period, and it occupied 13.8\% of the
   total area, with a range varying from 12\% to 23.0\%, in a
   representative, intensive agricultural area of China. In contrast to
   previous studies, we found that the locations of CSAs with P loss are
   spatially variable, and are more dispersed in their distribtition over
   the long term. We also found that precipitation acts as a key driving
   factor in the variation of CSAs at regional scale. The regional-scale
   method can provide scientific guidance for managing soil phosphorus loss
   and preventing the long-term eutrophication of water bodies at regional
   scale, and shows great potential for exploring factors that drive the
   variation in CSAs at global scale. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {An algorithm to estimate soil moisture over vegetated areas based on

Abstract = {An algorithm is proposed for estimating soil moisture over vegetated
   areas. The algorithm uses in situ and remote sensing information and
   statistical tools to estimate soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution
   and at 20 cm depth over Puerto Rico. Soil moisture within the study
   region is characterized by spatial and temporal variability. The
   temporal variability for a given area exhibits long- and short-term
   variations that can be expressed by two empirical models. The average
   monthly soil moisture exhibits the long- term variability and is
   modelled by an artificial neural network ( ANN), whereas the short-term
   variability is determined by hourly variation and is represented by a
   nonlinear stochastic transfer function model. Monthly vegetation index,
   land surface temperature, accumulated rainfall and soil texture are the
   major drivers of the ANN to estimate the monthly soil moisture. Radar,
   satellite and in situ observations are the major sources of information
   of the soil moisture empirical models. A self-organized ANN was also
   used to identify spatial variability to be able to determine a similar
   transfer function that best resembles the properties of a particular
   grid point and estimate the hourly soil moisture across the island.
   Validation techniques reveal an average absolute error of 3.34\% of
   volumetric water content and this result shows that the proposed
   algorithm is a potential tool for estimating soil moisture over
   vegetated areas.},

Title = {Electromagnetic scattering from multilayer rough surfaces with arbitrary

Year = {2007},
Volume = {45},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Radar remote sensing of soil moisture content at low frequencies
   requires an accurate scattering model of realistic soils, which often
   involves multilayer rough surfaces and dielectric profiles. In this
   paper, a hybrid analytical/numerical solution to two-dimensional
   scattering from multilayer rough surfaces separated by arbitrary
   dielectric profiles based on the extended boundary condition method
   (EBCM) and scattering matrix technique is presented. The reflection and
   transmission matrices of rough interfaces are constructed using EBCM.
   The dielectric profiles are modeled as stacks of piecewise homogeneous
   dielectric thin layers, whose scattering matrices are computed by
   recursively cascading reflection and transmission matrices of individual
   dielectric interfaces. The interactions between the rough interfaces and
   stratified dielectric profiles are taken into account by applying the
   generalized scattering matrix technique. The scattering coefficients are
   obtained by combining the powers computed from the resulting Floquet
   modes of the overall system. The bistatic scattering coefficients are
   validated against existing analytical and numerical solutions.
   Field-collected soil moisture data are then used for numerical
   simulations to investigate the penetration capability at different
   frequencies and to address the potential of low-frequency radar systems
   in estimating deep soil moisture. In particular, soil moisture profiles
   during dry ground, wet ground, and wet subsurface layer conditions are
   examined. The results show that both backscattering coefficients and
   copolarized phase difference at low frequencies are sensitive to the
   roughness of subsurface interfaces and deep soil moisture. Also, much
   larger depth sensitivity can be achieved using copolarized phase
   difference than scattering coefficients.},

Abstract = {An Observing System Simulation Experiment (OSSE) for the Aquarius/SAC-D
   mission has been developed for assessing the accuracy of soil moisture
   retrievals from passive L-band remote sensing. The implementation of the
   OSSE is based on the following: a 1-km land surface model over the
   Red-Arkansas River Basin, a forward microwave emission model to simulate
   the radiometer observations, a realistic orbital and sensor model to
   resample the measurements mimicking Aquarius operation, and an inverse
   soil moisture retrieval model. The simulation implements a zero-order
   radiative transfer model. Retrieval is performed by direct inversion of
   the forward model. The Aquarius OSSE attempts to capture the influence
   of various error sources, such as land surface heterogeneity, instrument
   noise, and retrieval ancillary parameter uncertainty, all on the
   accuracy of Aquarius surface soil moisture retrievals. In order to
   assess the impact of these error sources on the estimated volumetric
   soil moisture, a quantitative error analysis is performed by comparison
   of footprint-scale synthetic soil moisture with ``true{''} soil moisture
   fields obtained from the direct aggregation of the original 1-km soil
   moisture field input to the forward model. Results show that, in heavily
   vegetated areas, soil moisture retrievals have a positive bias that can
   be suppressed with an alternative aggregation strategy for ancillary
   parameter vegetation water content (VWC). Retrieval accuracy was also
   evaluated when adding errors to 1-km VWC (which are intended to account
   for errors in VWC derived from remote sensing data). For soil moisture
   retrieval root-mean-square error on the order of 0.05 m(3)/m(3), the
   error in VWC should be less than 12\%.},

Title = {Remote Sensing Derived Fire Frequency, Soil Moisture and Ecosystem
   Productivity Explain Regional Movements in Emu over Australia},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Species distribution modeling has been widely used in studying habitat
   relationships and for conservation purposes. However, neglecting
   ecological knowledge about species, e.g. their seasonal movements, and
   ignoring the proper environmental factors that can explain key elements
   for species survival (shelter, food and water) increase model
   uncertainty. This study exemplifies how these ecological gaps in species
   distribution modeling can be addressed by modeling the distribution of
   the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) in Australia. Emus cover a large area
   during the austral winter. However, their habitat shrinks during the
   summer months. We show evidence of emu summer habitat shrinkage due to
   higher fire frequency, and low water and food availability in northern
   regions. Our findings indicate that emus prefer areas with higher
   vegetation productivity and low fire recurrence, while their
   distribution is linked to an optimal intermediate (similar to 0.12 m(3)
   m(-3)) soil moisture range. We propose that the application of three
   geospatial data products derived from satellite remote sensing, namely
   fire frequency, ecosystem productivity, and soil water content, provides
   an effective representation of emu general habitat requirements, and
   substantially improves species distribution modeling and representation
   of the species' ecological habitat niche across Australia.},

Title = {Improvement and field testing of a combined horizontal penetrometer for
   on-the-go measurement of soil water content and mechanical resistance},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {123},
Pages = {1-10},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Soil water content has a significant effect on penetrometer resistance,
   so simultaneous on-the-go measurement of both these parameters can
   provide useful information on within-field spatial variations in soil
   compaction. In this study we improved and refined the electronic
   circuitry and mechanical construction of an existing sensor and
   evaluated it as a combined horizontal penetrometer in the field. This
   paper concentrates on its ability to determine soil water content
   (volumetric basis) in the field. Stationary calibration was first
   performed in the laboratory on remoulded loam soil (gleyic Cambisol) at
   gravimetric water content 0-0.28 g g(-1) and wet bulk density 1.4-1.8 g
   cm(-3). A quadratic relationship was found between sensor output and
   volumetric water content. Simulations of the sensor fringe field using a
   finite element model showed that at a dielectric constant of 5 (dry
   soil) the zone of influence of the sensor (i.e. the distance from the
   centre of the sensor) was approximately 70 mm, whilst at a dielectric
   constant of 30 (an estimate of wet soil) it was 40 mm. The dielectric
   sensor was then implemented together with a load cell on a tine for
   field measurement of water content and penetrometer resistance, and a
   series of transect measurements were conducted to assess its accuracy
   over a range of natural soil water contents in the field. Within the
   volumetric water content range 0.30-0.40 cm(3) cm(-3), a linear
   relationship fitted the sensor output versus water content data, which
   was in close agreement with the laboratory calibration. Additional
   studies on the effect of travelling speed on dielectric sensor
   performance showed no clear trends, but further investigations are
   needed. A significant negative correlation was observed between
   penetrometer resistance and water content. The developed combined
   horizontal penetrometer can be a promising useful instrument for future
   studies in soil compaction and precision agriculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {The assessment and quantification of spatio-temporal soil
   characteristics and moisture patterns are important parameters in the
   monitoring and modeling of soil landscapes. Remote-sensing techniques
   can be applied to characterize and quantify soil moisture patterns, but
   only when dealing with bare soil. For soils with vegetation, it is only
   possible to quantify soil-moisture characteristics through indirect
   vegetation indicators, i.e. the ``vitality{''} of plants. The
   ``vitality{''} of vegetation is a sum of many indicators, whereby
   different stress factors can induce similar changes to the biochemical
   and physiological characteristics of plants. Analysis of the cause and
   effect of soil-moisture properties, patterns and stress factors can
   therefore only be carried out using an experimental approach that
   specifically separates the causes. The study describes an experimental
   approach and the results from using an imaging hyperspectral sensor
   AISA-EAGLE (400-970 nm) and a non-imaging spectral sensor ASD (400-2,500
   nm) under controlled and comparable conditions in a laboratory to study
   the spectral response compared to biochemical and biophysical vegetation
   parameters ({''}vitality{''}) as a function of soil moisture
   characteristics over the entire blooming period of Ash trees. At the
   same time that measurements were taken from the hyperspectral sensors,
   the following vegetation variables were also recorded: leaf area index
   (LAI), chlorophyll meter value - SPAD-205, vegetation height, C/N
   content and leaf water content as indicators of the ``vitality{''} and
   the state of the vegetation. The spectrum of each hyperspectral image
   was used to calculate a range of vegetation indices (VI's) with
   relationships for soil moisture characteristics and stress factors. The
   relationship between vegetation indices and plant ``vitality{''}
   indicators was analysed using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The
   results show that leaf water content is the most appropriate vegetation
   indicator for assessing the ``vitality{''} of vegetation. With the Water
   Index (WI) it was possible to differentiate between the moisture
   treatments of the control, moisture drought stress and the moisture
   flooding treatment over the entire growing season of the plants (R (2) =
   0.94). There is a correlation between the ``vitality{''} vegetation
   parameters (LAI, C/N content and vegetation height) and the indicators
   NDVI, WI, PRI and Vog2. In our study with Ash trees the vegetation
   parameter chlorophyll was found not to be a suitable indicator for
   detecting the ``vitality{''} of plants using the spectral indicators.
   There is a possibility that the sensitivity of the indicators selected
   was too low compared to changes in the chlorophyll content of Ash trees.
   Adding the co-variable `time' strengthens the correlation, whereas
   incorporating time and moisture treatment only improves the model very
   slightly. This shows that changes to the biochemical and biophysical
   characteristics caused by phenology, overlay a differentiation of the
   moisture treatments.},

Abstract = {Ensemble Kalman filter is a new sequential data assimilation algorithm
   which was originally developed for atmospheric and oceanographic data
   assimilation. It can be applied to calculate error covariance matrix
   through Monte-Carlo simulation. This approach is able to resolve the
   nonlinearity and discontinuity existed within model operator and
   observation operator. When observation data are assimilated at each time
   step, error covariances are estimated from the phase-space distribution
   of an ensemble of model states. The error statistics is then used to
   calculate Kalman gain matrix and analysis increments. In this study, we
   develop a one-dimensional soil moisture data assimilation system based
   on ensemble Kalman filter, the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB2) and
   microwave radiation transfer model (AIEM, advanced integration equation
   model). We conduct numerical experiments to assimilate in situ soil
   surface moisture measurements and low-frequency passive microwave remote
   sensing data into a land surface model, respectively. The results
   indicate that data assimilation can significantly improve the soil
   surface moisture estimation. The improvement in root zone is related to
   the model bias errors at surface layer and root zone. The soil moisture
   does not vary significantly in deep layer. Additionally, the ensemble
   Kalman filter is predominant in dealing with the nonlinearity of model
   operator and observation operator. It is practical and effective for
   assimilating observations in situ and remotely sensed data into land
   surface models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   meters) leads to uncertainties in the performance of land surface
   hydrologic models. To overcome this drawback, we developed a new
   deterministic downscaling algorithm (DDA) for estimating fine-scale soil
   moisture with pixel-based RS soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET)
   products using a genetic algorithm. This approach was evaluated under
   various synthetic and field experiments (Little Washita-LW 13 and 21,
   Oklahoma) conditions including homogeneous and heterogeneous land
   surface conditions composed of different soil textures and vegetations.
   Our algorithm is based on determining effective soil hydraulic
   properties for different subpixels within a RS pixel and estimating the
   long-term soil moisture dynamics of individual subpixels using the
   hydrological model with the extracted soil hydraulic parameters. The
   soil moisture dynamics of subpixels from synthetic experiments matched
   well with the observations under heterogeneous land surface condition,
   although uncertainties (Mean Bias Error, MBE: -0.073 to -0.049) exist.
   Field experiments have typically more variations due to weather
   conditions, measurement errors, unknown bottom boundary conditions, and
   scale discrepancy between remote sensing pixel and model grid
   resolution. However, the soil moisture estimates of individual subpixels
   (from the airborne Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer
   (ESTAR) footprints of 800 m x 800 m) downscaled by this approach matched
   well (R: 0.724 to -0.914, MBE: -0.203 to -0.169 for the LW 13; R:
   0.343-0.865, MBE: -0.165 to -0.122 for the LW 21) with the in situ local
   scale soil moisture measurements during Southern Great Plains Experiment
   1997 (SGP97). The good correspondence of observed soil water
   characteristics (h) functions (from the soil core samples) and genetic
   algorithm (GA) searched soil parameters at the LW 13 and 21 sites
   demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. Although the algorithm is
   tested under limited conditions at field scale, this approach improves
   the availability of remotely sensed soil moisture product at finer
   resolution for various land surface and hydrological model applications.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the future European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts soil moisture analysis system based on a point-wise Extended
   Kalman Filter (EKF). The performance of the system is evaluated against
   the current operational Optimal Interpolation (OI) system. Both systems
   use proxy observations, i.e., 2 m air temperature and relative humidity.
   The spatial structure of the analysis increments obtained from both
   analyses are comparable. However, the EKF-based increments are generally
   higher for the top soil layers then for the bottom layer. This gradient
   better reflects the underlying hydrological processes in that the
   strongest interaction between soil moisture and bare soil evaporation
   and transpiration through vegetation should occur in top layers where
   most of the roots are located. The impact on the forecast skill, e. g.,
   air temperature at 2 m and 500 hPa height, is neutral. The new EKF
   surface analysis system offers a range of further development options
   for the exploitation of satellite observations for the initialization of
   the land surface in Numerical Weather Prediction. Citation: Drusch, M.,

Abstract = {Ecosystem water use efficiency is an important indicator of carbon and
   water cycle coupling. This study presents a new measure of water use
   efficiency, soil water use efficiency (SWUE), based on gross primary
   production and surface soil moisture derived from remote sensing
   products (ECV/-SM). Variation in SWUE among biomes, climate conditions,
   and latitudes from 2000 to 2014 was comprehensively assessed. Average
   global SWUE over this 15-year period was approximately 3.47 gC/kgH(2)O.
   SWUE was relatively high for ecosystems near the equator and decreased
   gradually with increasing latitude. At the biome level, high SWUE was
   measured in evergreen broadleaf forests, and lower values were found in
   shrublands. Compared with two other commonly used indicators of water
   use efficiency, EWUE (ratio of gross primary production to
   evapotranspiration) and RUE (ratio of gross primary production to
   precipitation), average SWUE from 2000 to 2014 was significantly higher
   and had the largest range of values. In addition, spatial distributions
   of these three indicators varied greatly. The new indicator SWUE will
   help promote understanding of soil water use in various ecosystems. (C)

Abstract = {An ensemble method was used to combine three surface soil moisture
   products, retrieved from passive microwave remote sensing data, to
   reconstruct a monthly soil moisture data set for China between 2003 and
   2010. Using the ensemble data set, the temporal and spatial variations
   of surface soil moisture were analyzed. The major findings were: (1) The
   ensemble data set was able to provide more realistic soil moisture
   information than individual remote sensing products; (2) during the
   study period, the soil moisture increased in semiarid regions and
   decreased in arid regions with anoverall drying trend for the whole
   country; (3) the soil moisture variation trends derived from the three
   retrieval products and the ensemble data differ from each other but all
   data sets show the dominant drying trend for the summer, and that most
   of the drying regions were in major agricultural areas; (4) compared
   with the precipitation trends derived from Global Precipitation
   Climatology Project data, it is speculated that climate change is a
   possible cause for the drying trend in semiarid regions and the wetting
   trend in arid regions; and (5) combining soil moisture trends with land
   surface temperature trends derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiomete, the study domain was divided into four categories.
   Regions with drying and warming trends cover 33.2\%, the regions with
   drying and cooling trends cover 27.4\%, the regions with wetting and
   warming trends cover 21.1\% and the regions with wetting and cooling
   trends cover 18.1\%. The first two categories primarily cover the major
   grain producing areas, while the third category primarily covers
   nonarable areas such as Northwest China and Tibet. This implies that the
   moisture and heat variation trends in China are unfavorable to
   sustainable development and ecology conservation.},

Abstract = {The brightness temperature (BT) and backscattering coefficient (BSC)
   measured simultaneously by passive and active microwave sensors have
   great potential for the estimation of land surface soil moisture (SM).
   Several methods with combined passive and active microwave remote
   sensing observations for SM have been reported. Usually, the use of
   these methods, requires an accurate roughness condition, especially when
   dealing over the bare surface or surface with low vegetation. In this
   paper, two different retrieval methods for estimating SM using synthetic
   microwave remote sensing data were compared. The difference between the
   two methods is the way to estimate the roughness parameter. The
   three-parameter retrieval approach (THRA) takes the roughness parameter
   as a variable to be retrieved, and derives land surface parameters
   (e.g., SM, surface temperature (ST) and roughness) simultaneously from
   BT and BSC using nonlinear algorithms. The two-parameter retrieval
   approach (TWRA) retrieves roughness from BSC firstly, then takes the
   roughness as an input parameter to retrieve SM and ST from BT. The two
   retrieval methods were applied on AMSR-E (Advance Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer for EOS) and QuikSCAT/Seawinds (The Seawinds scatterometer on
   NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Quick
   Scatterometer) observations which have been carried out for the SMEX03
   (Soil Moisture Experiment 2003) region in ON, the north of Oklanoma. The
   comparison results shows TWRA has achieved a higher accuracy than THRA
   in dealing with the active and passive microwave observations at
   different overpass times. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

   hydrogen, one of the main elements present in explosive materials. The
   elastic scattering of fast neutrons is affected by the strong resonances
   in the cross-section of the three other elements of explosives:
   nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon. In this work, Monte Carlo estimations of
   the soil moisture effects on landmine detection are presented.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {48},

Abstract = {Significant advances have been achieved in generating soil moisture (SM)
   products from satellite remote sensing and/or land surface modeling with
   reasonably good accuracy in recent years. However, the discrepancies
   among the different SM data products can be considerably large, which
   hampers their usage in various applications. The bias of one SM product
   from another is well recognized in the literature. Bias estimation and
   spatial correction methods have been documented for assimilating
   satellite SM product into land surface and hydrologic models.
   Nevertheless, understanding the characteristics of each of these SM data
   products is required for many applications where the most accurate data
   products are desirable. This study inter-compares five SM data products
   from three different sources with each other, and evaluates them against
   in situ SM measurements over 14-year period from 2000 to 2013.
   Specifically, three microwave (MW) satellite based data sets provided by
   ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (CCI-merged, -active and -passive
   products), one thermal infrared (TIR) satellite based product (ALEXI),
   and the Noah land surface model (LSM) simulations. The in-situ SM
   measurements are collected from the North American Soil Moisture
   Database (NASMD), which involves more than 600 ground sites from a
   variety of networks. They are used to evaluate the accuracies of these
   five SM data products. In general, each of the five SM products is
   capable of capturing the dry/wet patterns over the study period.
   However, the absolute SM values among the five products vary
   significantly. SM simulations from Noah LSM are more stable relative to
   the satellite-based products. All TIR and MW satellite based products
   are relatively noisier than the Noah LSM simulations. Even though MW
   satellite based SM retrievals have been predominantly used in the past
   years, SM retrievals of the ALEXI model based on TIR satellite
   observations demonstrate skills equivalent to all the MW satellite
   retrievals and even slightly better over certain regions. Compared to
   the individual active and passive MW products, the merged CCI product
   exhibits higher anomaly correlation with both Noah LSM simulations and
   in-situ SM measurements. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Global Monitoring (GM) mode
   offers an opportunity for global soil moisture (SM) monitoring at much
   finer spatial resolution than that provided by the currently operational
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System
   and future planned missions such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and
   Soil Moisture Active Passive. Considering the difficulties in modeling
   the complex soil-vegetation scattering mechanisms and the great need of
   ancillary data for microwave backscatter SM inversion, algorithms based
   on temporal change are currently the best method to examine SM
   variability. This paper evaluates the spatial sensitivity of the ASAR GM
   surface SM product derived using the temporal change detection
   methodology developed by the Vienna University of Technology. This
   evaluation is made for an area in southeastern Australia using data from
   the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005. The spatial evaluation is
   made using three different types of SM data (station, field, and
   airborne) across several different scales (1-25 km). Results confirmed
   the expected better agreement when using point (R-station = 0.75) data
   as compared to spatial (R-PLMR,R- 1 km = 0.4) data. While the
   aircraft-ASAR GM correlation values at 1-km resolution were low, they
   significantly improved when averaged to 5 km (R-PLMR,R- 5 km = 0.67) or
   coarser. Consequently, this assessment shows the ASAR GM potential for
   monitoring SM when averaged to a spatial resolution of at least 5 km.},

Abstract = {Drought is the costliest hazard among all natural disasters. Despite the
   significant improvements in drought modeling over the last decade,
   accurate provisions of drought conditions in a timely manner is still a
   major research challenge. In order to improve the current drought
   monitoring skills, this study presents a land data assimilation system
   by merging the remotely sensed surface soil moisture with the model
   simulations with the use of a recently developed particle Markov chain
   Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. To cope with the computational complexity, a
   modular parallel particle filtering framework (PPFF) is developed which
   allows a large ensemble size in PMCMC applications. The implementation
   of the proposed system is demonstrated with the 2012 summer flash
   drought case study over the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Results
   from both synthetic and real case studies suggest that the land data
   assimilation system improves the soil moisture predictions and the
   drought monitoring skills. Compared with the U.S. Drought Monitoring
   (USDM), the land data assimilation can better capture the drought onset
   on May 2012 and the drought severity in June and July 2012. This study
   recommends that the proposed land data assimilation system based on a
   high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure can better facilitate
   the drought preparation and response actions.},

Abstract = {The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS) was launched in
   November 2009 and started delivering data in January 2010. The
   commissioning phase ended in May 2010. Subsequently, the satellite has
   been in operation for over six years while the retrieval algorithms from
   Level 1 (L1) to Level 2 (L2) underwent significant evolutions as
   knowledge improved. Moreover, other approaches for retrieval at L2 over
   land were investigated while Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) were
   initiated. In this paper, these improvements were assessed by inter
   comparisons of the current L2 (V620) against the previous version (V551)
   and new products (using neural networks referred to as SMOS-NN) and 1.3
   (referred to as SMOS-L3). In addition, a global evaluation of different
   SMOS soil moisture (SM) products (SMOS-L2, SMOS-L3, and SMOS-NN) was
   performed comparing products with those of model simulations and other
   satellites. Finally, all products were evaluated against in situ
   measurements of soil moisture (SM). To achieve such a goal a set of
   metrics to evaluate different satellite products are suggested.
   The study demonstrated that the V620 shows a significant improvement
   (including those at L1 improving L2) with respect to the earlier version
   V551. Results also show that neural network based approaches can often
   yield excellent results over areas where other products are poor.
   Finally, global compa'rison indicates that SMOS behaves very well when
   compared to other sensors/approaches and gives consistent results over
   all surfaces from very dry (African Sahel, Arizona), to wet (tropical
   rain forests). RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is still an issue even
   though detection has been greatly improved through the significant
   reduction of RFI sources in several areas of the world. When compared to
   other satellite products, the analysis shows that SMOS achieves its
   expected goals and is globally consistent over different eco climate
   regions from low to high latitudes and throughout the seasons. (C) 2016

Title = {Satellite soil moisture for agricultural drought monitoring: Assessment
   of the SMOS derived Soil Water Deficit Index},

Abstract = {Drought is a major cause of limited agricultural productivity and of
   crop yield uncertainty throughout the world. For that reason,
   agricultural drought research and monitoring are of increasing interest.
   Although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify
   agricultural drought, the actual soil water content is rarely taken into
   account because this type of drought is commonly studied using
   methodologies based on either climatological data or hydrological
   modeling. Currently, it is possible to use remote sensing to obtain
   global and frequent soil moisture data that could be directly used for
   agricultural drought monitoring everywhere. For example, the SMOS (Soil
   Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite was launched in 2009 and provides
   global soil moisture maps every 1-2 days. In this work, the Soil Water
   Deficit Index (SWDI) was calculated using the SMOS 12 soil moisture
   series in the REMEDHUS (Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network) area
   (Spain) during the period 2010-2014. The satellite index was thus
   calculated using several approaches to obtain the soil water parameters
   and was compared with the SWDI obtained from in situ data. One approach
   was based directly on SMOS soil moisture time series (using the 5th
   percentile as an estimator for wilting point and the 95th percentile and
   the minimum of the maximum value during the growing season as estimators
   for field capacity). In this case, the results of the comparison were
   good, but the temporal distribution and the range of the index data were
   unrealistic. Other approaches were based on in situ data parameters and
   pedotransfer functions estimation. In this case, the results were
   better, and the satellite index was able to adequately identify the
   drought dynamics. Therefore, the final choice to apply the index in one
   particular site will depend on the availability of data. Finally, a
   comparison analysis was made with the SMOS SWDI and two indices (Crop
   Moisture Index, CMI, and Atmospheric Water Deficit, AWD) commonly used
   for agricultural drought monitoring and assessment. In both cases, the
   agreement was very good, and it was proven that SMOS SWDI reproduces
   well the soil water balance dynamics and is able to appropriately track
   agricultural drought. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In this study, we derived regional soil moisture (SM) using the latest
   Landsat 8 image and in situ soil moisture observations at the People's
   Victory Irrigation District, China. Landsat 8 image was used to
   construct the temperature-vegetation-dryness-index (TVDI), which
   integrates the vegetation index (VI) and land surface temperature (LST)
   to reflect the regional soil moisture conditions. The normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and
   modified soil adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI) were used in this study
   to construct the LST-VI feature space. The correlations between the in
   situ soil moisture observations and the three TVDIs calculated via the
   LST-NDVI, LST-EVI, and LST-MSAVI were analyzed. The results indicated
   that the three TVDIs had a negative correlation with the soil moisture.
   Then the effective depth of the surface soil moisture was analyzed and
   found that the soil moisture at a depth of 0-200 mm had a stronger
   correlation with the TVDIs than the other depths. Finally, the retrieval
   models were verified by using the remote sensing and in situ soil
   moisture data on another day.},

Title = {Permafrost Soil Moisture Monitoring Using Multi-Temporal TerraSAR-X Data
   in Beiluhe of Northern Tibet, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {Global change has significant impact on permafrost region in the Tibet
   Plateau. Soil moisture (SM) of permafrost is one of the most important
   factors influencing the energy flux, ecosystem, and hydrologic process.
   The objectives of this paper are to retrieve the permafrost SM using
   time-series SAR images, without the need of auxiliary survey data, and
   reveal its variation patterns. After analyzing the characteristics of
   time-series radar backscattering coefficients of different landcover
   types, a two-component SM retrieval model is proposed. For the alpine
   meadow area, a linear retrieving model is proposed using the TerraSAR-X
   time-series images based on the assumption that the lowest
   backscattering coefficient is measured when the soil moisture is at its
   wilting point and the highest backscattering coefficient represents the
   water-saturated soil state. For the alpine desert area, the surface
   roughness contribution is eliminated using the dual SAR images acquired
   in the winter season with different incidence angles when retrieving
   soil moisture from the radar signal. Before the model implementation,
   landcover types are classified based on their backscattering features.
   22 TerraSAR-X images are used to derive the soil moisture in Beiluhe,
   Northern Tibet with different incidence angles. The results obtained
   from the proposed method have been validated using in-situ soil moisture
   measurements, thus obtaining RMSE and Bias of 0.062 cm(3)/cm(3) and
   4.7\%, respectively. The retrieved time-series SM maps of the study area
   point out the spatial and temporal SM variation patterns of various
   landcover types.},

Abstract = {The evaluation of the relationship between satellite-derived vegetation
   indices (normalized difference vegetation index and normalized
   difference water index) and soil moisture improves our understanding of
   how these indices respond to soil moisture fluctuations. Soil moisture
   deficits are ultimately tied to drought stress on plants. The diverse
   terrain and climate of Oklahoma, the extensive soil moisture network of
   the Oklahoma Mesonet, and satellite-derived indices from the Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) provided an opportunity to
   study correlations between soil moisture and vegetation indices over the
   2002-2006 growing seasons. Results showed that the correlation between
   both indices and the fractional water index (FWI) was highly dependent
   on land cover heterogeneity and soil type. Sites surrounded by
   relatively homogeneous vegetation cover with silt loam soils had the
   highest correlation between the FWI and both vegetation-related indices
   (r similar to 0.73), while sites with heterogeneous vegetation cover and
   loam soils had the lowest correlation (r similar to 0.22). Citation: Gu,

Title = {Soil moisture forecasting by a hybrid machine learning technique: ELM
   integrated with ensemble empirical mode decomposition},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {330},
Pages = {136-161},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an essential component of the environmental and
   the agricultural system. Continuous monitoring and forecasting of soil
   moisture is a desirable strategy to understand the soil dynamics for
   proactive planning and decision-making measures for agriculture and
   related fields. In this study hybrid data-intelligent, extreme learning
   machine (ELM) models are designed and explored for monthly SM
   forecasting. The chaotic, complex and dynamical behavior of SM can
   compound the accuracy of data-driven models. Consequently, two
   versatile, computationally efficient and self-adaptive multi-resolution
   utilities namely, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with
   adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition
   (EEMD) algorithms are utilized to address these data non-stationarity
   issues, which if not resolved can lead to model prediction inaccuracies.
   The difference in these approaches is that, during the EEMD process, a
   Gaussian white noise is added to the intact (i.e., unresolved) time
   series only, while, the CEEMDAN requires sequential additions at each
   decomposition phase. Integration of these multi-resolution tools with
   the ELM model led to the hybrid CEEMDAN-ELM and the EEMD-ELM models,
   that were benchmarked with random forest (RF) equivalent models. Using
   WaterDyn model's hind-simulated SM data, these models were applied
   (without any climate inputs) to forecast the upper (0.2 m) and the lower
   layer (0.2-1.5 m depth) soil moisture in Australia's agricultural hub,
   the Murray-Darling Basin. The standalone ELM and RF model has similar
   computation efficiency and model performances. However, despite the
   implementation of computationally expensive ensemble techniques (i.e.,
   EEMD and CEEMDAN, the hybrid ensembles EEMD-ELM and CEEMDAN-ELM were
   highly efficient with improved performances. The research outcomes
   showed that the CEEMDAN-ELM model outperformed the alternative models at
   three (out of the seven) sites applied for upper layer SM forecasts,
   while the EEMD-ELM hybrid model was superior at all seven sites for the
   lower layer soil moisture forecasts. The study signifies the important
   role of the self-adaptive multi-resolution utility (CEEMDAN) hybridized
   with the ELM algorithm to potentially develop automated prediction
   systems for forecasting soil moisture, with potential applications in
   agriculture.},

Abstract = {A two-year field experiment was conducted during the rainy seasons of
   2004 and 2005 in the farmers' fields of Mahbubnagar district in Andhra
   Pradesh, India, to test the practice of cattle shed bedding with
   groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) shells by preparing Groundnut Shell
   Manure (GSM) and its application along with Farmers' practice (FP) and
   in comparison with five treatments namely, FP only, FP and GSM, FP and
   compost, regenerative (only organics) and Recommended Dose of
   Fertilizers (RDF), FP and RDF being the checks on rainy season rainfed
   groundnut and castor (Ricinus communis L.) crops. The results indicated
   that crops receiving GSM and compost performed well during the deficit
   rainfall year (2004) as well as during the normal rainfall year (2005)
   and recorded 12-16\% higher yields of groundnut and 9-14\% higher yields
   in castor over the FP. During 2004 which was a deficit rainfall year,
   GSM and compost application enhanced soil moisture by 14-40\%,
   percentage of filled pods by 59-65\% and 100 seed weight by 18\% in
   groundnut while in castor 6-33\% improved soil moisture enhanced
   capsules per plant from 45 to 57\% without any significant effect on 100
   seed weight. These treatments were followed by groundnut shell applied
   crop, RDF and regenerative (organics only) treatments. However, during
   2005 the order in which higher yields achieved by treatments were GSM
   application, compost followed by RDF due to well-distributed rainfall.
   Therefore to sustain yields in rainfed groundnut and castor crops,
   present experimentation emphasized application of organics to improve
   soil fertility and drought management ability by recycling crop residues
   through a simple process of cattle shed bedding. This was an attempt to
   introduce the practice of cattle shed bedding as value addition to
   process other locally available crop residues to the practitioners of

Title = {Research on the Optimum Water Content of Detecting Soil Nitrogen Using
   Near Infrared Sensor},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Nitrogen is one of the important indexes to evaluate the physiological
   and biochemical properties of soil. The level of soil nitrogen content
   influences the nutrient levels of crops directly. The near infrared
   sensor can be used to detect the soil nitrogen content rapidly,
   nondestructively, and conveniently. In order to investigate the effect
   of the different soil water content on soil nitrogen detection by near
   infrared sensor, the soil samples were dealt with different drying times
   and the corresponding water content was measured. The drying time was
   set from 1 h to 8 h, and every 1 h 90 samples (each nitrogen
   concentration of 10 samples) were detected. The spectral information of
   samples was obtained by near infrared sensor, meanwhile, the soil water
   content was calculated every 1 h. The prediction model of soil nitrogen
   content was established by two linear modeling methods, including
   partial least squares (PLS) and uninformative variable elimination
   (UVE). The experiment shows that the soil has the highest detection
   accuracy when the drying time is 3 h and the corresponding soil water
   content is 1.03\%. The correlation coefficients of the calibration set
   are 0.9721 and 0.9656, and the correlation coefficients of the
   prediction set are 0.9712 and 0.9682, respectively. The prediction
   accuracy of both models is high, while the prediction effect of PLS
   model is better and more stable. The results indicate that the soil
   water content at 1.03\% has the minimum influence on the detection of
   soil nitrogen content using a near infrared sensor while the detection
   accuracy is the highest and the time cost is the lowest, which is of
   great significance to develop a portable apparatus detecting nitrogen in
   the field accurately and rapidly.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to estimate soil moisture with soil red
   and nir (near-infrared) band reflectance from TM/ETM+ remotely sensed
   images acquired over vegetated fields. Based on linear decomposition
   algorithm of mixture pixel, first the soil reflectance from red-nir
   bands were directly and computationally derived by combining soil line
   equation with a developed empirical relationship between vegetation
   canopy and mixture pixel reflectance in red-nir spectral feature space.
   Then, a remote sensing image from TM with measurement data from
   experimental fields in Beijing, China, was used to establish the
   retrieval relationships between soil moisture and soil reflectance from
   the red and nir bands, and the results showed that the retrieval of soil
   moisture was better with nir band reflectance than that of red. Finally,
   the soil moisture retrieved method was further evaluated and validated
   with two images from ETM+ and ground measurements from fields in Walnut
   Creek, America, and the analysis showed that the proposed method could
   be used to monitor soil moisture well, with the correlation coefficient
   exceeding 0.80. The preliminary results with such acceptable accuracy
   indicate that the method of estimating soil moisture based on the linear
   decomposition of mixture pixels is reasonable and suitable for being
   widely applied in different temporal and spatial scaled fields. (C) 2011

Abstract = {A multilayer soil model is presented for improved estimation of soil

   in soil moisture retrievals using experimental microwave backscattering
   coefficient data in the literature. Results show that the mean square
   errors between the measured data and the values estimated by the

Abstract = {This paper evaluates the performance of different soil moisture products
   from AMSR2 and SMOS against the most representative stations within the
   Yanco study area in the Murrumbidgee catchment, in southeast Australia.
   AMSR2 Level 3 (L3) soil moisture products retrieved from two versions of
   brightness temperatures using the Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency
   (JAXA) and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm were
   included. For the LPRM algorithm, two different parameterization methods
   were applied. Furthermore, two versions of SMOS L3 soil moisture product
   were assessed. The results are contrasted against the use of
   ``random{''} stations. Accounting for all versions, frequencies and
   overpasses, the latest versions of the JAXA UX2) and LPRM (LP3) products
   were found to surpass the earlier versions (JX1, LP1 and LP2). Soil
   moisture retrieval based on the latter version of brightness temperature
   and parameterization scheme improved when C-band observations were used
   but not X-band. However, X-band retrievals (r: 0.71, MAE: 0.07, RMSD:
   0.08 m3/m3) were found to perform better than C-band (r: 0.68-0.70, MAE:
   0.070.09 m(3)/m(3), RMSD: 0.09-0.10 m(3)/m(3)). Moreover, an
   intercomparison between different acquisition times (morning and
   evening) of AMSR2 X-band products found a better performance from
   evening overpasses (1:30 pm; r: 0.69-0.77) as opposed to morning
   overpasses (1:30 am; r: 0.47-0.66). In the case of SMOS, morning (6:00
   am; r: 0.77) retrievals were found to be superior over evening (6:00 pm;
   r: 0.69) retrievals. Overall, both versions of JAXA products, the second
   and third versions of LPRM X-band products, and two versions of SMOS
   products were found to meet the mean average error (MAE) goal accuracy
   of the AMSR2 mission (MAE < 0.08 m(3)/m(3)) but none of the products
   achieved the SMOS goal of RMSD < 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Furthermore,
   performance of the products differed depending on the statistic used to
   evaluate them. Consequently, considering the results in this study, JX2
   products are recommended if both absolute and temporal accuracy of the
   soil moisture product is of importance, whereas LP3(x) products from
   evening observations and SMOS version 3.00 (SMOS2) products from morning
   overpasses are recommended if temporal accuracy is of greater
   importance. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An examination of direct ground wave soil moisture monitoring over an
   annual cycle of soil conditions},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {46},
Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {Direct ground wave (DGW) measurements obtained with ground-penetrating
   radar have been used in a number of previous studies to estimate
   volumetric water content in the shallow soil zone; however, these
   studies have generally involved controlled field experiments or
   measurements collected across limited natural ranges of soil moisture
   conditions. To further investigate the capacity of this method, we have
   undertaken an extensive field study using multifrequency (i.e., 225,
   450, and 900 MHz) DGW measurements to monitor a complete annual cycle of
   soil water content variations typical of midlatitude climates at three
   sites with different soil textures. The use of common-midpoint surveys
   allowed us to understand the nature and evolution of the near-surface
   electromagnetic wavefields and their impact on DGW moisture predictions.
   We present the novel characterization of a wide-range of seasonal
   moisture dynamics including soil freezing and thawing process using
   multifrequency DGW measurements for a range of soil textures. These data
   showed significant temporal variations in both the near-surface
   wavefield and multifrequency DGW velocities corresponding to both
   seasonal and shorter-term variations in soil conditions. Although all of
   the measurement sites displayed similar temporal responses, the rate and
   magnitude of these velocity variations corresponded to varying soil
   water contents, which were controlled by the soil textural properties.
   Although there were no observed systematic differences in DGW velocities
   due to frequency dispersion for the 225-900 MHz range, the DGW
   measurements obtained using higher-frequency antennas was less impacted
   by near-surface wavefield interference due to their shorter signal pulse
   duration. DGW velocity measurements combined with an appropriate
   dielectric mixing formula provided quantitative predictions of soil
   water content that accurately replicated the soil sample data over the
   annual cycle of moisture conditions.},

Title = {Development of an ATI-NDVI method for estimation of soil moisture from
   MODIS data},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {35},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3797-3815},
Abstract = {Estimation of soil moisture is essential for research of climatology,
   hydrology, and ecology. The commonly used remotely sensed approach is
   LST-NDVI (land-surface temperature-normalized difference vegetation
   index). In this study, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) is used
   instead of surface temperature to develop an ATI-NDVI space for
   estimation of soil moisture. Comparison with ground-based measurements
   shows a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.0378 m(3) m(-3) between
   retrieved and measured soil moistures. Validation with time series in
   situ data indicates the RMSE as 0.0162, 0.0285, 0.0368, and 0.0093 m(3)
   m(-3) for forest, shrub, cropland, and grassland, respectively, which is
   comparable to or even better than the results of previous studies. The
   proposed method in this study is a remote-sensing approach without
   elaborate ancillary data except for the percentage of sand in the soil,
   and it is practical and convenient to be applied to regions with
   surfaces from bare soil to full vegetation and the entire range of
   surface moisture contents from wet to dry.},

Title = {Shortcut approach alternative to the step-by-step conventional soil
   phosphorus fractionation method},
Journal = {COMMUNICATIONS IN SOIL SCIENCE AND PLANT ANALYSIS},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {39},
Number = {9-10},
Pages = {1295-1310},
Abstract = {In an attempt to characterize the phosphorus (P)-supplying capacity of a
   soil and to understand the dynamics of soil P, a procedure was followed
   whereby consecutive extraction procedures were carried out on a soil
   sample, first by dialysis membrane tubes filled with hydrous ferric
   oxide (DMT-HFO), followed by subsequent P fractionation procedure.
   However, this combined method is lengthy and time-consuming, and an
   approach to shorten these P desorption studies in soils was important.
   The major objective of this article, therefore, was to present a
   shortcut method as an alternative approach to the combined fractionation
   method. Comparison of the sum of DMT-HFO-P-i, sodium bicarbonate
   (NaHCO3)-P-i, sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-P-i, D/hydrochloric acid
   (HCl)-P-i, and C/HCl-P-i extracted by a conventional step-by-step method
   with the sum of DMT-HFO-P-i and a single D/HCl-P-i extraction as a
   shortcut approach for all extraction periods resulted in a very strong
   and significant correlations. Both these methods were correlated with
   maize grain yield, and it was found to be highly significant. This study
   revealed that this shortcut approach could be a simplified and
   economically viable option to study the P dynamics of soils especially
   for soils where the P pool acting as a source in replenishing the labile
   portion of P is already identified.},

Abstract = {Downscaling of microwave remotely sensed that soil moisture content
   (SMC) is an efficient way to obtain spatial continuous SMC at a finer
   resolution. However, the classical optical/thermal and microwave fusion,
   and the active and passive microwave fusion cannot work under
   all-weather conditions because of contamination of clouds or the lack of
   suitable radar data source. In this study, a microwave and
   meteorological fusion (MMF) is provided. The MMF method is based on a
   complementary relationship hypothesis assuming SMC is reflected in the
   adjacent surface atmospheric moisture under midday conditions. By this
   method, daily passive SMC products from Soil Moisture Active Passive
   (SMAP) mission with 36-km resolution were disaggregated using a daily
   gridded meteorological data with nominal 4-km resolution. The original
   and downscaled SMCs were evaluated by comparing with in situ SMC
   obtained from three core validation sites and three sparse networks. The
   experiment was conducted in the central part of the U.S. from April 2015
   to June 2018. Results demonstrated that the downscaled SMC maintained
   the dynamic range of original SMC product and energy was conserved.
   Furthermore, the downscaled SMC showed good agreement with and slightly
   outperformed the original SMC as compared with in situ SMC. The
   downscaling method is shown to capture higher resolution SMC spatial
   variability while preserving the quality of original SMC. However,
   because of the complexity of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions, the
   actual contributing domain of downscaled SMC may be greater than 4 km.
   The MMF method is suggested as a supplementary for all-weather
   downscaling coarse-resolution SMC.},

Abstract = {The analysis of feedback phenomena, which occur between continental

   the European Remote Sensing wind scatterometer instrument, in which an
   empirical model is used to estimate volumetric soil moisture. This
   approach takes into account the effects of vegetation and soil roughness
   in the soil moisture estimation process. The proposed estimations have
   been validated using different methods, and a good degree of coherence
   has been observed between satellite estimations and ground truth
   measurements over the Banizambou site in Niger. Moisture and rainfall
   estimations for the same site are shown to be strongly correlated.
   Comparison with the multimodel analysis product provided by the Global
   Soil Wetness Project, Phase 2, indicates that their estimations are well
   correlated, although land surface models provide slightly overestimated

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical environmental variable, as it significantly
   affects infiltration, evapotranspiration and surface and subsurface
   runoff processes. Measurement of soil moisture, however, has only
   recently become possible over large scales. In modelling applications,
   the spatial distribution of soil moisture is typically assumed to mirror
   that of a terrain attribute such as the wetness index of {[}Beven KJ,
   Kirkby MJ. A physically based, variable contributing area model of basin
   hydrology. Hydrol Sci Bull 1979;24(1):43-69] (e.g. TOPMODEL {[}2].
   Intense ground-based measurements of the spatial distribution of soil
   moisture in the root zone have been conducted in Australia and New
   Zealand, allowing examination of the predictive power of various terrain
   attributes with respect to soil moisture. Here a method is developed
   that enables the generation of realistic spatio-temporal patterns of
   soil moisture based on the changing importance of spatial attributes
   with average wetness condition (theta) over bar (t). Maps of terrain and
   other spatial attributes are combined and weighted according to
   relationships dependent on (theta) over bar (t) to generate simulated
   spatial patterns of soil moisture. The method is presently based on
   field data and requires spatial patterns of soil moisture for a range of
   (theta) over bar (t) conditions in order to establish relationships
   between (theta) over bar (t) and the attributes. Observed variability is
   introduced by adding an error term whose statistics are also a function
   of (theta) over bar (t). Ultimately generalised weightings could be
   derived, based on the literature or subjective assessment by the user.

Abstract = {Satellite moisture estimates have received increasing attention over the
   past decade. This paper examines the applicability of estimating soil
   moisture states and soil hydraulic parameters through two particle
   filter (PF) methods: The PF with commonly used sampling importance
   resampling (PF-SIR) and the PF with recently developed Markov chain
   Monte Carlo sampling (PF-MCMC) methods. In a synthetic experiment, the
   potential of assimilating remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture
   measurements into a 1-D mechanistic soil water model (HYDRUS-1D) using
   both the PF-SIR and PF-MCMC algorithms is analyzed. The effects of
   satellite temporal resolution and accuracy, soil type, and ensemble size
   on the assimilation of soil moisture are analyzed. In a real data
   experiment, we first validate the Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture products in the
   Oklahoma Little Washita Watershed. Aside from rescaling the remotely
   sensed soil moisture, a bias correction algorithm is implemented to
   correct the deep soil moisture estimate. Both the ascending and
   descending AMSR-E soil moisture data are assimilated into the HYDRUS-1D
   model. The synthetic assimilation results indicated that, whereas both
   updating schemes showed the ability to correct the soil moisture state
   and estimate hydraulic parameters, the PF-MCMC scheme is consistently
   more accurate than PR-SIR. For real data case, the quality of remotely
   sensed soil moisture impacts the benefits of their assimilation into the
   model. The PF-MCMC scheme brought marginal gains than the open-loop
   simulation in RMSE at both surface and root-zone soil layer, whereas the
   PF-SIR scheme degraded the open-loop simulation.},

Title = {Spatially and Temporally Complete Satellite Soil Moisture Data Based on
   a Data Assimilation Method},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Multiple soil moisture products have been generated from data acquired
   by satellite. However, these satellite soil moisture products are not
   spatially or temporally complete, primarily due to track changes,
   radio-frequency interference, dense vegetation, and frozen soil. These
   deficiencies limit the application of soil moisture in land surface
   process simulation, climatic modeling, and global change research. To
   fill the gaps and generate spatially and temporally complete soil
   moisture data, a data assimilation algorithm is proposed in this study.
   A soil moisture model is used to simulate soil moisture over time, and
   the shuffled complex evolution optimization method, developed at the
   University of Arizona, is used to estimate the control variables of the
   soil moisture model from good-quality satellite soil moisture data
   covering one year, so that the temporal behavior of the modeled soil
   moisture reaches the best agreement with the good-quality satellite soil
   moisture data. Soil moisture time series were then reconstructed by the
   soil moisture model according to the optimal values of the control
   variables. To analyze its performance, the data assimilation algorithm
   was applied to a daily soil moisture product derived from the Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E),
   the Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave
   Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). Preliminary analysis using soil moisture
   data simulated by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah
   model and soil moisture measurements at a multi-scale Soil Moisture and
   Temperature Monitoring Network on the central Tibetan Plateau
   (CTP-SMTMN) was performed to validate this method. The results show that
   the data assimilation algorithm can efficiently reconstruct spatially
   and temporally complete soil moisture time series. The reconstructed
   soil moisture data are consistent with the spatial precipitation
   distribution and have strong positive correlations with the values
   simulated by the GLDAS Noah model over large areas of the region.
   Compared to the soil moisture measurements at the medium and large
   networks, the reconstructed soil moisture data have almost the same
   accuracy as the soil moisture product derived from AMSR-E/MWRI/AMSR2 for
   ascending and descending orbits.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture retention (SMR) capacity plays a key role in estimating
   the direct runoff when a multi-pulse storm event occurs. It is very
   important to know how much SMR will be recovered during the intervals of
   no rain of a multi-pulse storm. This study developed a new approach for
   derivation of the SMR recovery curve (R-curve) at sub-daily time-scales
   using the Curve Number (CN) method. The methodology was applied using
   complex storm events in the Napa River basin, California. The R-curve is
   classified into three sections depending on the recovery rate of SMR
   during the inter-storm interval of no rain (INR), and this study defines
   the characteristics. The first section of the R-curve (INR 0-21 h with
   0.97 mm/h) is described as gradually recovering SMR, since water is
   being infiltrated and the upper soil layer is not fully saturated. The
   second section (INR 21-36 h with 2.11 mm/h) is defined as steeply
   recovering S due to downward drainage (sub-surface/inter flows) and
   evaporation without infiltration. The third section (INR 36-68 h with
   0.34 mm/h) is described as gradually decreasing recovery dependent on
   evaporation since percolation and drainage have almost stopped.},

   Results suggest that while theta(0-60) is indeed more valuable than

Abstract = {The conventional gravimetric methods of estimating soil moisture content

   measured from four potato fields in New Brunswick and Prince Edward
   Island using a pre-calibrated (R-2= 0.98) time domain reflectometry
   (TDR) from root zone of potato tubers under grid sampling arrangements.
   Horizontal co-planar (HCP) and perpendicular co-planar (PRP) readings
   were taken using DuaIEM-lI sensor from the same locations of theta
   measurements. There was a better correlation between PRP and theta (r:
   0.64-0.83) was calculated than between HCP and theta (r: 0.41-0.79).
   There was no significant difference (R-2: 0.60-0.69; RMSE (root mean

Abstract = {Single capacitance sensors are sensitive to soil property variability.
   The objectives of this study were to: (i) establish site-specific
   laboratory calibration equations of three single capacitance sensors
   (EC-20, EC-10, and ML2x) for tropical soils, and (ii) evaluate the
   accuracy and precision of these sensors. Intact soil cores and bulk
   samples, collected from the top 20 and 80 cm soil depths at five
   locations across the Upper Makaha Valley watershed, were analyzed to
   determine their soil bulk density (rho(b)), total porosity (theta(t)),
   particle size distribution, and electrical conductivity (EC). Laboratory
   calibration equations were established using soil packed columns at six
   water content levels (0-0.5 cm(3) cm(-3)). Soil bulk density and
   theta(t) significantly varied with sampling depths; whereas, soil clay
   content (CC) and EC varied with sampling locations. Variations of rho(b)
   and theta(t) at the two depths significantly affected the EC-20 and ML2x
   laboratory calibration functions; however, there was no effect of these
   properties on calibration equation functions of EC-10. There was no
   significant effect of sampling locations on the laboratory calibration
   functions suggesting watershed-specific equations for EC-20 and ML2x for
   the two depths; a single watershed-specific equation was needed for
   EC-10 for both sampling depths. The laboratory calibration equations for
   all sensors were more accurate than the corresponding default equations.
   ML2x exhibited better precision than EC-10, followed by EC-20. We
   conclude that the laboratory calibration equations can mitigate the
   effects of varying soil properties and improve the sensors' accuracy for
   water content measurements.},

Abstract = {The joint National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Japanese
   Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Global Precipitation Measurement
   (GPM) mission will provide considerably more observations over complex
   and dynamically changing land backgrounds. A physically based
   precipitation retrieval using GPM's satellite constellation of passive
   microwave (PMW) observations has to accommodate the spatially and
   temporally varying radiometric signature of the land surface to
   constrain the set of candidate rainfall solutions. The challenge for
   retrieval algorithms is to identify and isolate precipitation profiles
   whose simulated observations agree with the satellite observations and
   are also representative of the surface conditions. Microwave emissivity
   modeling results are presented from a physically based land algorithm
   that retrieves soil moisture, vegetation water content, and surface
   temperature, along with the emissivity using polarized 10, 18, and 37
   GHz channel measurements from the WindSat sensor onboard the Coriolis
   satellite, and results from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission
   (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI). The emissivity mean, coefficient of
   variation, covariance, and correlation slope are examined for the range
   of clear-scene surface properties observed by WindSat and TRMM between
   2003-2012 and 2002-2011, respectively, under a range of seasons, time of
   day, rain events, etc. These joint data provide a means to examine the
   extent to which the surface geophysical properties control the microwave
   land surface emissivity covariability, to better utilize these lower
   frequency observations in overland PMW-based precipitation retrievals.},

Title = {Development of a Low-Cost Multi-Depth Real-Time Soil Moisture Sensor
   Using Time Division Multiplexing Approach},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {19688-19697},
Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an integral parameter for scheduling irrigation.
   The precise and real-time measurement of SM is difficult due to its
   complex nature. The purpose of this paper was to determine whether the
   time division multiplexing (TDM) approach would effectively estimate SM
   content. We developed a sensor to detect SM from four soil depths (10,
   20, 40, and 60 cm) simultaneously by using the TDM technique. This is a
   type of EM sensor that indirectly estimates the SM on the basis of the
   dielectric properties of soil. Three types of soil samples were used to
   calibrate the sensor. The calibration models were established using
   polynomial (3rd order) fitting equations. The performance of the sensor
   was evaluated both in the laboratory and in situ conditions. The
   sensitivity of the sensor was examined in a micro-control irrigation
   system. The sensor measured SM contents in a soil box were compared with
   HYDRUS-2D simulated wetting patterns. The results were in the optimal
   range, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranged from 0.97 to
   0.99 and root means square error (RMSE) from 0.72 to 2.01. The IDM
   detection circuit-based sensor R-2 value was 0.97, and its RMSE was
   2.78. Whereas the independent detection circuit R-2 values ranged from
   0.93 to 0.96 and RMSE from 4.09 to 5.07. The results determined that the
   sensor could be used for continuous SM measurements, which would be
   advantageous for planning the irrigation practices in arid and irrigated
   regions.},

Title = {A high sensitivity single-probe heat pulse soil moisture sensor based on
   a single <i>npn</i> junction transistor},
Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {139-147},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The classic technique for measuring soil water content using heat
   dissipation properties was employed to develop a new single probe heat
   pulse sensor (SPHP). The novel sensor is comprised of only one element,
   a npn junction bipolar transistor, which works as both heating and
   temperature sensing elements. The variations of V-BE(T) as a function of
   the temperature are used to measure the temperature of the sensor and,
   since the behaviour of V-BE(T) is one of the most well studied
   expressions that describe the bipolar transistor, the sensor's
   temperature can be easily measured, with high accuracy. A technique
   which increases simultaneously the collector-base voltage V-CB and the
   collector current I-C of the transistor allows for the application of
   the heat pulse with low level currents, in the order of 6 mA. The sensor
   developed in this work presented a Delta T-max range of 9.1 degrees C
   between wet and dry soil conditions (theta(nu) between 5\% and 35\%),
   while the current available heat pulse probe sensors present a typical
   Delta T-max range of only 1.5 degrees C, showing the potential benefits
   of using a single bipolar junction transistor as a high sensitivity soil
   water content measurement sensor. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Title = {Empirical two-point α-mixing model for calibrating the ECH<sub>2</sub>O
   EC-5 soil moisture sensor in sands},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2008},
Volume = {44},
Month = {NOV 18},
Abstract = {Recently improved ECH2O soil moisture sensors have received significant
   attention in many field and laboratory applications. Focusing on the
   EC-5 sensor, a simple and robust calibration method is proposed. The
   sensor-to-sensor variability in the readings (analog-to-digital
   converter (ADC) counts) among 30 EC-5 sensors was relatively small but
   not negligible. A large number of ADC counts were taken under various
   volumetric water contents (theta) using four test sands. The proposed
   two-point alpha-mixing model, as well as linear and quadratic models,
   was fitted to the ADC-theta data. Unlike for conventional TDR
   measurements, the effect of sensor characteristics is lumped into the
   empirical parameter a in the two-point alpha-mixing model. The value of
   a was fitted to be 2.5, yielding a nearly identical calibration curve to
   the quadratic model. Errors in theta associated with the
   sensor-to-sensor variability for the two-point alpha-mixing model were
   +/- 0.005 cm(3) cm(-3) for dry sand and +/- 0.028 cm(3) cm(-3) for
   saturated sand. In the validation experiments, the highest accuracy in
   water content estimation was achieved when sensor-specific ADC(dry) and
   ADC(sat) were used in the two-point alpha-mixing model. Assuming that
   alpha = 2.5 is valid for most mineral soils, the two-point alpha-mixing
   model only requires the measurement of two extreme ADC counts in dry and
   saturated soils. Sensor-specific ADC(dry) and ADC(sat) counts are
   readily measured in most cases. Therefore, the two-point alpha-mixing
   model (with alpha = 2.5) can be considered as a quick, easy, and robust
   method for calibrating the ECH2O EC-5 sensor. Although further
   investigation is needed, the two-point alpha-mixing model may also be
   applied to calibrating other sensors.},

Abstract = {Crop management practices influence readily and potentially available N
   in soil. In this study, we evaluated the effects of organic amendment
   history and crop rotation on potentially mineralizable N (N-0),
   mineralizable N pools, and field estimates of soil N supply in potato
   (Solanum tuberosum L.) production, and evaluated a suite of N
   availability measures to detect changes in these parameters. Preplant
   soil samples (top 15-cm) were collected from the potato year of a
   rotation trial in Maine during 2004 and 2005. Treatments included three
   crop rotations, with and without a history of organic amendment {[}solid
   beef (Bos taurus) manure] application: PB, potato-barley (Hordeum
   vulgare L.); PSPB, potato-soybean {[}Glycine max (L.)
   Merr.]-potato-barley; and PSBA/T, potato-soybean-barley-alfalfa
   (Medicago sativa L.)/timothy (Phleum pratense L.). The No and
   mineralizable N pools were determined by aerobic incubation at 25
   degrees C and periodic leaching for 24 wk with a fixed-k approach. On
   average, historically amended soil had 35\% higher values of N-0, and an
   8\% higher proportion of mineralizable N partitioned to the stable
   mineralizable N pool, compared with nonamended soil. Lower values of
   N-0, mineralizable N pools and some measures of N availability were
   measured in PSBA/T compared with PB and PSPB rotations. All tested
   measures of N availability detected management-induced changes in No and
   mineralizable N pools. The preplant nitrate, UV absorbance of 0.01
   MNaHCO3 extract at 205 nm and particulate organic matter (POM)-N were
   the best predictors of field-based indices of soil N supply (r(2) = 0.50
   to 0.73). Management-induced changes in the size and quality of
   mineralizable N should be considered in developing best N management
   programs through organic amendment application and crop rotations.},

Title = {Field Level Soil Moisture Variability at 6-and 3-cm Sampling Depths:
   Implications for Microwave Sensor Validation},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Calibration/validation experiments are critical to developing and
   testing soil moisture retrieval algorithms from microwave remote sensing
   platforms. Ground sampling must be optimally designed to minimize
   sources of error or bias during data collection. An important
   consideration in the design of ground sampling campaigns is that the in
   situ measured soil moisture is representative of the retrieval depth of
   a microwave sensor. Because of the popularity of portable impedance
   probe instruments, volumetric soil moisture is usually measured at a
   constant depth of approximately 0 to 6 cm and aggregated over a spatial
   extent representative of a pixel footprint. However, the retrieval depth
   of microwave signals can vary, and in agricultural soils is typically
   representative of the top similar to 5 cm (or less) of the soil surface.
   It is unknown whether this mismatch between the depth of ground measured
   soil moisture and microwave retrieved soil moisture significantly
   contributes to error during sensor calibration/validation. This issue is
   addressed based on an analysis of over 3400 impedance probe measurements
   collected in 72 agricultural fields over four sampling occasions.
   Volumetric soil moisture was measured at depths of approximately 6 and 3
   cm, at 24 locations in each field. The observed soil moisture sampling
   distributions and statistical moments are compared between these two
   measurement depths. Results demonstrate that the majority of fields
   exhibit a near-normal sampling distribution at both the 6- (60 of 72)
   and 3-cm (59 of 72) depths. An average difference of 0.016 m(3) m(-3)
   exists between all field means, generally indicating that wetter
   measurements are observed from the samples at 6 cm than those at 3 cm.
   Statistically significant differences were found between the measurement
   depths for field means (23 of 72), distributions (21 of 72), and
   variances (9 of 72). These findings demonstrate the importance of
   recognizing near-surface volumetric soil moisture spatial and depth
   variability effects during ground sampling experiments to minimize error
   in calibration/validation of retrieval algorithms.},

Abstract = {It has been demonstrated that soil moisture sensor systems (SMSs)
   designed for landscape irrigation can save water. However, SMSs have not
   been tested with reclaimed wastewater. Both salts contained in the
   irrigation water and temperature might alter the soil water content
   (SWC) sensed by SMSs. The objective of this research was to quantify the
   effect of salinity and/or temperature on the precision and accuracy of
   three different commercially available SMSs. The brands, controllers,
   and probes selected for this experiment were as follows: Acclima, SCX,
   and Digital TDT, Baseline, WaterTec S100, and biSensor, and Dynamax,
   IL200-MC, and SM200. Every SMS was replicated three times. Each SMS
   probe was installed in the center of different containers filled with an
   Arredondo fine sand. The containers were placed in a
   controlled-temperature chamber and were saturated and dried down across
   a combination of three temperatures (10, 25, or 35 degrees C) and three
   electrical conductivities (0, 0.7, or 5dS/m). Each container was placed
   on a platform scale to determine soil water losses, by weight variation
   over time. The actual or measured SWCs were then compared with their
   respective SMS readings. A regression analysis was performed, per brand,
   for each combination of salinity and temperature. Acclima resulted in
   the most robust and reliable system, with no practical reading
   variations when exposed to different combinations of temperatures and
   salinities. Both Baseline and Dynamax systems were sensitive to high
   salinity and/or high temperature, making their use more difficult in
   extreme or changing situations. However, all tested SMSs followed with
   adequate precision the SWC under the different salinity and temperature
   scenarios. Consequently, these SMSs might achieve an adequate landscape
   irrigation control, even when their readings might not correspond to the
   actual SWC. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

Abstract = {Climate change is significantly altering rainfall patterns globally and
   will likely cause increases in extreme rainfall events. Grassland
   systems are particularly vulnerable to these changes as their
   productivity is strongly mediated by soil water content (SWC). SWC mean
   and variability are driven by the amount of rainfall received as well as
   the distribution through time of that rainfall. In this study, we used a
   model grassland system in a controlled glasshouse experiment to identify
   whether SWC mean or variability is a stronger driver of productivity. We
   then examined how extreme rainfall events alter this driver and the
   resulting effect this has on productivity and biomass allocation under
   ambient and elevated carbon dioxide (CO2). Rainfall amount was held
   constant, but distribution through time varied (control, one in 20years
   event, one in 100years event). SWC variability was a stronger driver of
   productivity (mesocosm biomass) than SWC mean, with increasing extreme
   rainfall event magnitude resulting in greater SWC variability.
   Surprisingly, elevated CO2 only had a small effect on these productivity
   and biomass allocation responses which may be due to the relatively
   small CO2 difference tested. Our results suggest that distribution of
   rainfall in time is an important driver of grassland productivity and
   that increases in extreme rainfall events, for a given total rainfall,
   will result in reduced grassland productivity.},

Abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of using inverse vadose zone modeling for
   estimating field-scale actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was explored at a
   long-term agricultural monitoring site in eastern Nebraska. Data from
   both point-scale soil water content (SWC) sensors and the area-average
   technique of cosmic-ray neutron probes were evaluated against
   independent ETa estimates from a co-located eddy covariance tower. While
   this methodology has been successfully used for estimates of groundwater
   recharge, it was essential to assess the performance of other components
   of the water balance such as ETa. In light of recent evaluations of land
   surface models (LSMs), independent estimates of hydrologic state
   variables and fluxes are critically needed benchmarks. The results here
   indicate reasonable estimates of daily and annual ETa from the point
   sensors, but with highly varied soil hydraulic function
   parameterizations due to local soil texture variability. The results of
   multiple soil hydraulic parameterizations leading to equally good ETa
   estimates is consistent with the hydrological principle of equifinality.
   While this study focused on one particular site, the framework can be
   easily applied to other SWC monitoring networks across the globe. The
   value-added products of groundwater recharge and ETa flux from the SWC
   monitoring networks will provide additional and more robust benchmarks
   for the validation of LSM that continues to improve their forecast
   skill. In addition, the value-added products of groundwater recharge and
   ETa often have more direct impacts on societal decision-making than SWC
   alone. Water flux impacts human decision-making from policies on the
   long-term management of groundwater resources (recharge), to yield
   forecasts (ETa) and to optimal irrigation scheduling (ETa) Illustrating
   the societal benefits of SWC monitoring is critical to insure the
   continued operation and expansion of these public datasets.},

Abstract = {The study focussed on the rotational farming system and the soil
   nutrient status of south-eastern Nigeria. Both surface and sub-surface
   physical and chemical properties of forest and burnt soils were compared
   using laboratory techniques. The soil nutrient parameters determined
   included per cent sand, silt, and clay, pH, organic matter, N, available
   P, Ca, Mg, Na, and K, exchangeable acidity, effective cation exchange
   capacity, and base saturation. The results indicated significant
   differences in the soil physical and chemical properties between forest
   and burnt surface and sub-surface soils. Lower values of:soil nutrients
   were recorded in the burnt soils compared to the forest soils.},

Volume = {217},
Number = {1-2},
Pages = {181-196},

Abstract = {Within the GLOWA-Danube project, the integrated decision support system
   DANUBIA was developed to address effects of global change on water
   resources of the Upper Danube watershed (similar to 80,000 km(2)). Key
   components of DANUBIA in respect to water quality and plant growth
   modelling are nitrogen turnover, nitrogen fluxes and storages. This
   paper discusses an approach to model soil nitrogen dynamics in a
   mesoscale watershed. Within the model, the soil column is represented by
   three soil layers. The model components for water fluxes, nitrogen
   uptake and nitrogen transformation are process-based. To validate the
   model, field data from four locations were used. Nitrogen modelling
   results are in good agreement with measured data. Statistical analysis
   for soil nitrogen and water content resulted in satisfactory indices of
   agreement. The study demonstrated that the coupled soil moisture and
   soil nitrogen transformation model is suitable to simulate the fate of
   mineral nitrogen within the soil profile on the field scale. Sensitivity
   studies indicate that the model quality for large scale modelling
   depends particularly upon the appropriate representation of sandy soils,
   the accurate parameterization of the saturated hydraulic conductivity
   and the precise initialization of soil mineral nitrogen content. (C)

Title = {Incorporation of globally available datasets into the roving cosmic-ray
   neutron probe method for estimating field-scale soil water content},

Abstract = {The need for accurate, real-time, reliable, and multi-scale soil water
   content (SWC) monitoring is critical for a multitude of scientific
   disciplines trying to understand and predict the Earth's terrestrial
   energy, water, and nutrient cycles. One promising technique to help meet
   this demand is fixed and roving cosmic-ray neutron probes (CRNPs).
   However, the relationship between observed low-energy neutrons and SWC
   is affected by local soil and vegetation calibration parameters. This
   effect may be accounted for by a calibration equation based on local
   soil type and the amount of vegetation. However, determining the
   calibration parameters for this equation is labor- and time-intensive,
   thus limiting the full potential of the roving CRNP in large surveys and
   long transects, or its use in novel environments. In this work, our
   objective is to develop and test the accuracy of globally available
   datasets (clay weight percent, soil bulk density, and soil organic
   carbon) to support the operability of the roving CRNP. Here, we develop
   a 1 km product of soil lattice water over the continental United States
   (CONUS) using a database of in situ calibration samples and globally
   available soil taxonomy and soil texture data. We then test the accuracy
   of the global dataset in the CONUS using comparisons from 61 in situ
   samples of clay percent (RMSE = 5.45 wt \%, R-2 = 0.68), soil bulk
   density (RMSE = 0.173 g cm(-3), R-2 = 0.203), and soil organic carbon
   (RMSE = 1.47 wt \%, R-2 = 0.175). Next, we conduct an uncertainty
   analysis of the global soil calibration parameters using a Monte Carlo
   error propagation analysis (maximum RMSE similar to 0.035 cm(3) cm(-3)
   at a SWC = 0.40 cm(3) cm(-3)). In terms of vegetation, fast- growing
   crops (i.e., maize and soybeans), grasslands, and forests contribute to
   the CRNP signal primarily through the water within their biomass and
   this signal must be accounted for accurate estimation of SWC. We
   estimated the biomass water signal by using a vegetation index derived
   from MODIS imagery as a proxy for standing wet biomass (RMSE < 1
   kgm(-2)). Lastly, we make recommendations on the design and validation
   of future roving CRNP experiments.},

Abstract = {Adoption of soil test-based nutrient management is important for
   achieving sustainable development of agriculture. The present study
   analysed the factors influencing the adoption of soil nutrient
   management technology package comprising adoption of soil test and
   recommended fertiliser by paddy farmers in the southern Indian state of
   Karnataka by using field survey data. Bivariate probit model was used to
   estimate the sequential adoption decisions on soil test and fertiliser

   training on fertiliser application and education had positive and
   significant effect on adoption of soil nutrient technology package. The
   likelihood of adoption of soil test technology decreases with increase
   in distance measured from farm to soil test laboratory. Availability of
   fewer family labour increases the probability of adoption of soil
   nutrient management technology. These results have significant policy
   implications for provision of soil testing facilities nearer to villages
   and for conducting periodical training programmes for encouraging the
   farmers to adopt soil test-based nutrient management.},

Abstract = {The Actively Heated Fiber Optic (AHFO) method is shown to be capable of
   measuring soil water content several times per hour at 0.25 m spacing
   along cables of multiple kilometers in length. AHFO is based on

   presented were collected from 750 m of cable buried in three 240 m
   colocated transects at 30, 60, and 90 cm depths in an agricultural field
   under center pivot irrigation. The calibration curve relating soil water
   content to the thermal response of the soil to a heat pulse of 10 W
   m(-1) for 1 min duration was developed in the lab. This calibration was
   found applicable to the 30 and 60 cm depth cables, while the 90 cm depth
   cable illustrated the challenges presented by soil heterogeneity for
   this technique. This method was used to map with high resolution the
   variability of soil water content and fluxes induced by the
   nonuniformity of water application at the surface.},

Title = {Vulnerability of Bavarian silt loam soil to compaction under heavy wheel
   traffic: impacts of tillage method and soil water content},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2005},
Volume = {84},
Number = {2},
Pages = {200-215},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Soil compaction caused by traffic of heavy vehicles and machinery has
   become a problem of world-wide concern. The aims of this study were to
   evaluate and compare the changes in bulk density, soil strength,
   porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability during
   sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) harvesting on a typical Bavarian soil
   (Regosol) as well as to assess the most appropriate variable factors
   that fit with the effective controlling of subsequent compaction. The
   field experiments, measurements and laboratory testing were carried out
   in Freising, Germany. Two tillage systems (conventional plough tillage
   and reduced chisel tillage) were used in the experiments. The soil water
   contents were adjusted to 0.17 g g(-1) (w(1)), 0.27 g g(-1) (w(2)) and
   0.35 g g(-1) (w(3)).
   Taking the increase in bulk density, the decrease in air permeability
   and reduction of wide coarse pore size porosity (-6 kPa) into account,
   it seems that CT (ploughing to a depth of 0.25 m followed by two passes
   of rotary harrow to a depth 0.05 m) of plots were compacted to a depth
   of at least 0.25 m and at most 0.40 m in high soil water (w(3))
   conditions. The trends were similar for ``CT w(1){''} (low soil water
   content) plots. However, it seems that ``CT w(1){''} plots were less
   affected than ``CT w(3){''} plots with regard to bulk density increases
   under partial load. In contrast, diminishments of wide coarse pores (-6
   kPa) and narrow (tight) coarse pores (-30 kPa) were significantly higher
   in ``CT w(1){''} plots down to 0.4 m. Among CT plots, the best physical
   properties were obtained at medium soil water (w(2)) content. No
   significant increase in bulk density and no significant decrease in
   coarse pore size porosity and total porosity below 0.2 m were observed
   at medium soil water content. The soil water content seemed to be the
   most decisive factor.
   It is likely that, CS (chiselling to a depth of 0.13 m followed by two
   passes of rotary harrow to a depth 0.05 m) plots were less affected by
   traffic treatments than CT plots. Considering the proportion of coarse
   pore size porosity (structural porosity) and total porosity, no
   compaction effects below 0.3 m were found. Medium soil water content
   (w(2)) provides better soil conditions after traffic with regard to wide
   coarse pore size porosity (-6 kPa), air permeability (at 6 and 30 kPa
   water suction), total porosity and bulk density. Proportion of wide
   coarse pores, air permeability and bulk density seems to be suitable
   parameters to detect soil compaction under the conditions tested. (C)

Title = {Impacts of Re-Vegetation on Surface Soil Moisture over the Chinese Loess
   Plateau Based on Remote Sensing Datasets},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {8},
Number = {2},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A large-scale re-vegetation supported by the Grain for Green Project
   (GGP) has greatly changed local eco-hydrological systems, with an impact
   on soil moisture conditions for the Chinese Loess Plateau. It is
   important to know how, exactly, re-vegetation influences soil moisture
   conditions, which not only crucially constrain growth and distribution
   of vegetation, and hence, further re-vegetation, but also determine the
   degree of soil desiccation and, thus, erosion risk in the region. In
   this study, three eco-environmental factors, which are Soil Water Index
   (SWI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and
   precipitation, were used to investigate the response of soil moisture in
   the one-meter layer of top soil to the re-vegetation during the GGP. SWI
   was estimated based on the backscatter coefficient produced by the
   European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1/2) and Meteorological
   Operational satellite program (MetOp), while NDVI was derived from SPOT
   imageries. Two separate periods, which are 1998-2000 and 2008-2010, were
   selected to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of the chosen
   eco-environmental factors. It has been shown that the amount of
   precipitation in 1998-2000 was close to that of 2008-2010 (the
   difference being 13.10 mm). From 1998-2000 to 2008-2010, the average
   annual NDVI increased for 80.99\%, while the SWI decreased for 72.64\%
   of the area on the Loess Plateau. The average NDVI over the Loess
   Plateau increased rapidly by 17.76\% after the 10-year GGP project.
   However, the average SWI decreased by 4.37\% for two-thirds of the area.
   More specifically, 57.65\% of the area on the Loess Plateau experienced
   an increased NDVI and decreased SWI, 23.34\% of the area had an
   increased NDVI and SWI. NDVI and SWI decreased simultaneously for
   14.99\% of the area, and the decreased NDVI and increased SWI occurred
   at the same time for 4.02\% of the area. These results indicate that
   re-vegetation, human activities, and climate change have impacts on soil
   moisture. However, re-vegetation, which consumes a large quantity of
   soil water, may be the major factor for soil moisture change in most
   areas of the Loess Plateau. It is, therefore, suggested that Soil
   Moisture Content (SMC) should be kept in mind when carrying out
   re-vegetation in China's arid and semi-arid regions.},

Abstract = {Remote-sensing (RS)-based agricultural drought indicators, such as the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference
   water index (NDWI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and normalized
   difference drought index (NDDI), have been popularly used in
   agricultural drought monitoring, analysis and related applications.
   Understanding the relationships between these indicators and root zone
   soil moisture under different canopies will help reduce uncertainties
   and enhance reliability of estimating soil moisture levels over a large
   area, and thus improve the accuracy in drought monitoring, analysis, and
   forecasting. This research aims to investigate such relationships and
   choose a drought indicator that best correlates with soil moisture
   observed at various depths from the soil climate analysis network (SCAN)
   sites, with 0-64 days of lagging periods. Results from the study show
   that the indicators applied to corn led to statistically significant
   correlations with soil moisture at deeper depths and also the soil
   moisture memory can be kept for a long period of time (32-48 days),
   while the indicators applied to soybeans correlated best with soil
   moisture at shallower depths and the soil moisture memory can only be
   kept for a short time (concurrent to 16 days).},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {522},
Pages = {274-284},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The impact of leaf area index (LAI) seasonality on three-year
   (2005-2007) daily soil moisture predictions was investigated for two
   different land surface models (IBIS and HYDRUS) at the Stanley semi-arid
   grassland field site. Three daily LAI time series derived from different
   empirical NDVI-LAI relationships using the MODIS NDVI data were used in
   the analysis. Calibration results from both models consistently
   suggested that an average LAI over time, rather than a time varying
   daily LAI, was sufficient to reproduce daily soil moisture at our site.
   We did, however, find that the sensitivity of the impact of LAI time
   variability on soil moisture estimation was a function of soil
   parameters. The influence of LAI time variation on the soil moisture
   simulations is controlled by the sensitivity of modelled soil moisture
   to the average LAI values over that period, and soil parameters affected
   the sensitivity of the model to LAI. Those parameter sets that were most
   sensitive to the long-term mean LAI were also those that were the most
   sensitive to the time variability. In our case, model calibrations using
   a constant LAI adjusted the soil parameters to reduce the impact of LAI
   variability. Results also suggested that the LAI variability could be
   significant if the varying LAI approached a very low level (i.e. LAI <
   1) for a significant proportion of the simulation period. This is most
   likely to be the case for short grasses in grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier

   Soil Moisture and Salinity Variability in Coastal Areas},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {12},
Number = {4},
Pages = {723-731},
Abstract = {Soil moisture and salinity are two crucial coastal saline soil
   variables, which influence the soil quality and agricultural
   productivity in the reclaimed coastal region. Accurately characterizing
   the spatial variability of these soil parameters is critical for the
   rational development and utilization of tideland resources. In the
   present study, the spatial variability of soil moisture and salinity in
   the reclaimed area of Hangzhou gulf, Shangyu City, Zhejiang Province,
   China, was detected using the data acquired from radar image and the
   proximal sensor EM38. Soil moisture closely correlates radar scattering
   coefficient, and a simplified inversion model was built based on a
   backscattering coefficient extracted from multi-polarization data of
   ALOS/PALSAR and in situ soil moisture measured by a time domain
   reflectometer to detect soil moisture variations. The result indicated a
   higher accuracy of soil moisture inversion by the HH polarization mode
   than those by the HV mode. Soil salinity is reflected by soil apparent
   electrical conductivity (ECa). Further, ECa can be rapidly detected by
   EM38 equipment in situ linked with GPS for characterizing the spatial
   variability of soil salinity. Based on the strong spatial variability
   and interactions of soil moisture and salinity, a cokriging
   interpolation method with auxiliary variable of backscattering
   coefficient was adopted to map the spatial variability of ECa. When
   compared with a map of ECa interpolated by the ordinary kriging method,
   detail was revealed and the accuracy was increased by 15.3\%. The
   results conclude that the integrating active remote sensing and proximal
   sensors EM38 are effective and acceptable approaches for rapidly and
   accurately detecting soil moisture and salinity variability in coastal
   areas, especially in the subtropical coastal zones of China with
   frequent heavy cloud cover.},

Abstract = {A Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) for the analysis of
   land surface prognostic variables is designed and implemented at the
   Meteorological Service of Canada for the initialization of numerical
   weather prediction and climate models. The assimilation of different
   data sources for the production of daily soil moisture and temperature
   analyses is investigated in a set of observing system simulation
   experiments over North America. A simplified variational technique is
   adapted to accommodate different observation types at their appropriate
   time in a 24-h time window. The screen-level observations of temperature
   and relative humidity, from conventional synoptic surface observations
   (SYNOP)/aviation routine weather report (METAR)/surface aviation
   observation (SA) reports, are considered together with presently
   available satellite observations provided by the Aqua satellite
   (microwave C-band), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite
   (GOES) {[} infrared (IR)], and observations available in the future by
   the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission (microwave
   L-band). The aim of these experiments is to assess the information
   content brought by each observation type in the land surface analysis.
   The observation systems are simulated according to their spatial
   coverage, temporal availability, and nominal or expected errors. The
   results show that the observable with the largest dynamical response to
   perturbations of the control variable carries the greatest information
   content into the analysis. The observational error and the observation
   frequency counterbalance this feature in the analysis. If one considers
   a single observation both for soil moisture and soil temperature
   analysis, then satellite measurements (L-band, C-band, and IR in
   decreasing order of importance) are the primary source of information.
   When observation availability is considered and the highest temporal
   frequency of screen-level observations is used (1 h), a large amount of
   information is extracted from SYNOP-like reports. The screen-level
   observations are shown to provide valuable soil moisture information
   mainly during the daytime, while during nighttime these observations
   (and particularly screen-level temperature) are mostly useful for the
   soil temperature analysis. The results are presented with perspectives
   for future operational developments},

Abstract = {The incorporation of remote sensing (RS) data into digital soil models
   has shown success to improve soil predictions. However, the effects of
   multiresolution imagery on modeling of biogeochemical soil properties in
   aquatic ecosystems are still poorly understood. The objectives of this
   study were the following: 1) to develop prediction models for soil total
   phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) utilizing RS images and
   environmental ancillary data at three different resolutions; 2) to
   identify controlling factors of the spatial distribution of soil TP and
   TN; and 3) to elucidate the effects of different spatial resolutions of
   RS images on inferential modeling. Soil cores were collected (n = 108)
   from the top 10 cm in a subtropical wetland: Water Conservation Area-2A,
   the Florida Everglades, USA. The spectral data and derived indices from
   RS images, which have different spatial resolutions, included the
   following: MODIS (500 m resampled to 250 m), Landsat ETM+ (30 m), and
   SPOT (10 m). Block kriging and random forest (RF) were employed to
   predict soil TP and TN using RS-image-derived spectral input variables,
   environmental ancillary data, and soil observations. The RF models
   showed R-2 between 0.90 and 0.93 and root mean square error between
   100.4 and 115.9 mg.kg(-1) for TP and between 1.45 and 1.52 g.kg(-1) for
   TN. Soil TP was mainly predicted from RS-derived spectral indices that
   infer on biotic/vegetation characteristics, whereas soil TN was
   predicted using a combination of biotic/vegetation, topographic, and
   hydrologic variables. Results suggest that the spectral data informed
   soil models have excellent predictive capabilities in this aquatic
   ecosystem. Interestingly, there was no noticeable distinction among
   different spatial resolutions of RS images to develop prediction models
   for soil TP and TN in terms of error assessment. However, the
   variability and complexity of soil TP and TN variations were much better
   expressed with the finer resolution RFSPOT model than the coarser
   resolution RFMODIS model as demonstrated using entropy.},

Abstract = {A surface soil moisture (SSM) product at a 1-km spatial resolution
   derived from the Envisat Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) Global
   Monitoring (GM) mode data was evaluated over the entire African
   continent using coarse spatial resolution SSM acquisitions from the
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System
   (AMSR-E) and the Noah land surface model from the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System (GLDAS-NOAH). The evaluation was performed in terms
   of relative soil moisture values (\%), as well as anomalies from the
   seasonal cycle. Considering the high radiometric noise of the ASAR GM
   data, the SSM product exhibits a good ability (Pearson correlation
   coefficient (R) = similar to 0.6 for relative soil moisture values and
   root mean square difference (RMSD) = 11\% when averaged to 5-km
   resolution) to monitor temporal soil moisture variability in regions
   with low to medium density vegetation and yearly rainfall >250 mm. The
   findings agree with previous evaluation studies performed over Australia
   and further strengthen the understanding of the quality of the ASAR GM
   SSM product and its potential for data assimilation. Problems identified
   in the ASAR GM algorithm over arid regions were explained by azimuthal
   effects. Diverse backscatter behavior over different soil types was
   identified. The insights gained about the quality of the data were used
   to establish a reliable masking of the existing ASAR GM SSM product and
   the identification of areas where further research is needed for the
   future Sentinel-1-derived SSM products.},

Abstract = {For monitoring soil fertility after changing farm management from highly
   conventional to organic farming on the newly established research farm
   of Kassel University, two permanent-soil monitoring sites were installed
   in 1999. Representative locations for installing the permanent-soil
   monitoring sites were selected using geographical information systems
   (GIS), based on available data from geology, topography, soil taxation,
   land use, and intensive auger-borehole records and analysis with a very
   high spatial resolution of data. The soils are represented by a Luvisol
   derived from loess and a Vertisol developed from claystone. The soil
   properties of the two monitoring sites measured immediately after
   changing to organic farming showed high contents of extractable
   nutrients as a result of the former intensive fertilization practice
   during conventional farm management. The microbial soil properties of
   the two monitoring sites were in the medium range of regional soils. A
   first evaluation of the development of soil properties was done after 5
   y of monitoring. The soil organic-matter content increased slightly
   after grass-clover and after application of farmyard manure. The amounts
   of K and P decreased clearly at the loess site without application of
   farmyard manure. At the clay site, the unique application of farmyard
   manure led to increasing contents of extractable K and P in the top
   soil. The variation of soil properties increased clearly after perennial
   crops like grass-clover and in years after application of farmyard
   manure.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical element in the hydrological cycle, which is
   intimately tied to agriculture production, ecosystem integrity, and
   hydrological cycle. Point measurements of soil moisture samples are
   laborious, costly, and inefficient. Remote sensing technologies are
   capable of conducting soil moisture mapping at the regional scale. The
   advanced microwave scanning radiometer on earth observing system
   (AMSR-E) provides global surface soil moisture (SSM) products with the
   spatial resolution of 25 km which is not sufficient enough to meet the
   demand for various local-scale applications. This study refines AMSR-E
   SSM data with normalized multiband drought index (NMDI) derived from the
   moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to provide
   fused SSM product with finer spatial resolution that can be up to 1 km.
   Practical implementation of this data fusion method was carried out in
   Central America Isthmus region to generate the SSM maps with the spatial
   resolution of 1 km during the dry seasons in 2010 and 2011 for various
   agricultural applications. The calibration and validation of the SSM
   maps based on the fused images of AMSR-E and MODIS yielded satisfactory

   sequential Monte Carlo-Particle Filter technique, being well known for
   capability of modeling high nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes, is
   applied to assimilate surface soil moisture measurement to the deep
   layers. The experiments were carried out over several locations over the

Abstract = {This study demonstrated a new method for mapping high-resolution
   (spatial: 1 m, and temporal: 1 h) soil moisture by assimilating
   distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observed soil temperatures at
   intermediate scales. In order to provide robust soil moisture and
   property estimates, we first proposed an adaptive particle batch
   smoother algorithm (APBS). In the APBS, a tuning factor, which can avoid
   severe particle weight degeneration, is automatically determined by
   maximizing the reliability of the soil temperature estimates of each
   batch window. A multiple truth synthetic test was used to demonstrate
   the APBS can robustly estimate soil moisture and properties using
   observed soil temperatures at two shallow depths. The APBS algorithm was
   then applied to DTS data along a 71 m transect, yielding an hourly soil
   moisture map with meter resolution. Results show the APBS can draw the
   prior guessed soil hydraulic and thermal properties significantly closer
   to the field measured reference values. The improved soil properties in
   turn remove the soil moisture biases between the prior guessed and
   reference soil moisture, which was particularly noticeable at depth
   above 20 cm. This high-resolution soil moisture map demonstrates the
   potential of characterizing soil moisture temporal and spatial
   variability and reflects patterns consistent with previous studies
   conducted using intensive point scale soil moisture samples. The
   intermediate scale high spatial resolution soil moisture information
   derived from the DTS may facilitate remote sensing soil moisture product
   calibration and validation. In addition, the APBS algorithm proposed in
   this study would also be applicable to general hydrological data
   assimilation problems for robust model state and parameter estimation.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS AND ELECTRONICS IN AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {107},

Abstract = {Determining the best way to efficiently use limited water resources, for
   food and energy-dedicated crops, has become crucial due to the rise in
   extreme events (floods/droughts) and higher variability in rainfall
   attributed to global climate change. Changing climate conditions will
   require new crops to be adapted to a changing agricultural environment.
   Reliable information on seasonal trends in crop growth and
   evapotranspiration with associated uncertainty/confidence ranges is
   crucial to guide the development of new crops and management strategies
   to cope with future climate. Given that crop growth is strongly coupled
   to soil moisture, developing reliable growth curves requires a detailed
   understanding of soil moisture at the field-scale. Typically, it is
   impractical to collect soil samples to adequately assess soil moisture
   that represents both spatial distribution at the field-scale and
   temporal dynamics on the scale of a growing season (e.g. 110 days for
   cereals). A novel way to address soil moisture monitoring challenges is
   through an integrated, agro-ecosystems-level approach using an
   integrated sensing system that can link data from multiple platforms
   (wireless sensors, satellites, airborne imagery, near real-time climate
   stations). Assimilated data can, then, be fed into predictive models to
   generate reference crop growth curves and predict regionally-specific
   yield potentials. However, integrated sensing requires interagency
   cooperation, common data processing standards and long-term, timely
   access to data. Large databases need to be reusable by various
   organizations and accessible, in the future, with comprehensive
   metadata. During the 2012 growing season a feasibility study was
   conducted which involved measuring field-scale soil moisture with sensor
   network technology. The experiment utilized radially-distributed sensors
   for tracking in-season soil moisture. OpenGIS-compliant services and
   standards were utilized to provide long-term access to sensor data and
   construct corresponding metadata. Sensor Model Language, an
   inter-operable metadata format, was used to create documentation for the
   sensor system and sensing components. Two different third party
   implementations of the Sensor Observation Service were tested for
   providing long-term access to the data. This work discusses a set of key
   recommendations for monitoring field-scale soil moisture dynamics for
   integration with remote sensing and models, including: (1) Improved in
   situ sensing technology that would allow for less restrictive soil
   moisture measurements. (2) Integration of field-scale in situ networks
   with regional remote sensing monitoring. (3) The development of software
   and web services to integrate data from multiple sources with models for
   decision support. (C) 2014 Crown Copyright and Elsevier B.V. Published

   Estimation by Dielectric Mixing},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {43179-43191},
Abstract = {Integration of cyber technologies with agriculture provides
   opportunities for precision agriculture. It requires buried underground
   sensors to provide useful content information to the end-user for crop
   management. In our earlier studies, we developed an impedance
   measurement-based in-situ wireless soil moisture and salinity sensor, an
   electrophoretic sensor for measuring soil ions/nutrients, and
   nano-patterned plasmonic-resonance, as well as guided-mode
   resonance-based optical sensors for the plant, released volatile organic
   compounds. Here we present a physics-based approach to infer the
   moisture and ionic concentration in the soil from in-situ,
   multi-frequency measurements of the impedance of a metamaterial-inspired
   sensing element buried underground. Such model holds the advantage over
   empirical models by obviating the need to redo the calibration for
   different soil types. Our method involves performing an inversion
   analysis on the Bruggeman's dielectric mixing model. Under the
   quasi-static assumption, the approach predicts volumetric moisture
   content and ion concentration with 90\% accuracy in terms of the molar
   fraction of total volume for silver nitrate concentrations of 0 to 100
   mM. We observed that soil conductivity is near-linear to the inferred
   ionic concentration for a given saline water fraction in the soil. The
   model has been validated by making multi-frequency impedance
   measurements of a soil mixture at different concentrations comprising of
   various constituents of soil, air, water, and ions.},

Abstract = {Using the first full annual cycle of Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite
   System (CyGNSS) observations, we investigated the limitations and
   capabilities of CyGNSS observations for soil moisture (SM) estimates
   (0-5cm). A relative signal-to-noise ratio (rSNR) value from a
   CyGNSS-derived delay-Doppler map is introduced to improve the temporal
   resolution of SM derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data.
   We then evaluated the CyGNSS-derived rSNR using ground-based SM
   measurements and the triple collocation method with SMAP and modeled SM
   products. We found that CyGNSS can provide useful SM estimates over
   moderately vegetated regions (correlation coefficient of the individual
   data: 0.77) but shows degraded performance over arid and densely
   vegetated regions (correlation coefficient of the individual data: 0.68
   and 0.67). However, when rSNR data is combined with SM data from SMAP,
   daily SM estimates can be achieved. These results show that synergistic
   use of CyGNSS observations can improve on SM estimates from current
   satellite systems.
   Plain Language Summary Accurate climate forecasting affects our daily
   lives. Large-scale farmers depend on weather forecasts to decide when to
   plant their crops. Bad timing can impact the whole years' harvest and
   thus the farmers' livelihoods. Even more importantly, people who live in
   floodplains and hurricane zones trust their lives to accurate weather
   forecasts. For these reasons and more, hydrologists need up-to-date
   knowledge of Earth's climate systems. And one of the most important
   sources of data may surprise you. The amount of moisture in just the
   first 8mm of topsoil affects all of Earth's climate systems. Currently,
   National Aeronautics and Space Administration keeps track of soil
   moisture levels with a satellite called Soil Moisture Active Passive.
   However, it only provides soil moisture data every 2-3 days. We believe
   that we can do better, and we believe that we can do it with preexisting
   satellite systems. In 2017, National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration (NASA) launched eight microsatellites, called Cyclone
   Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS), to predict cyclone paths.
   We have found that while the CyGNSS satellites are predicting cyclone
   paths, they can simultaneously measure changes in soil moisture around 5
   times per day. Augmenting the Soil Moisture Active Passive data with
   CyGNSS would give us detailed prediction of weather changes in near-real

Title = {Application of a hillslope-scale soil moisture data assimilation system
   to military trafficability assessment},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important environmental variable that impacts
   military operations and weapons systems. Accurate and timely forecasts
   of soil moisture at appropriate spatial scales, therefore, are important
   for mission planning. We present an application of a soil moisture data
   assimilation system to military trafficability assessment. The data
   assimilation system combines hillslope-scale (e.g., lOs to 100s of m)
   estimates of soil moisture from a hydrologic model with synthetic L-band
   microwave radar observations broadly consistent with the planned NASA
   Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Soil moisture outputs from
   the data assimilation system are input to a simple index-based model for
   vehicle trafficability. Since the data assimilation system uses the
   ensemble Kalman Filter, the risks of impaired trafficability due to
   uncertainties in the observations and model inputs can be quantified.
   Assimilating the remote sensing observations leads to significantly
   different predictions of trafficability conditions and associated risk
   of impaired trafficability, compared to an approach that propagates
   forward uncertainties in model inputs without assimilation.
   Specifically, assimilating the observations is associated with an
   increase in the risk of ``slow go{''} conditions in approximately
   two-thirds of the watershed, and an increase in the risk of ``no go{''}
   conditions in approximately 40\% of the watershed. Despite the
   simplicity of the trafficability assessment tool, results suggest that
   ensemble-based data assimilation can potentially improve trafficability
   assessment by constraining predictions to observations and facilitating
   quantitative assessment of the risk of impaired trafficability. (C) 2013

Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a two-year experiment carried out in
   mountain areas on soil moisture retrieval from remotely sensed images.
   In particular, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   RADARSAT and single polarization ASAR images were used. During
   acquisitions of SAR over the test area in Alto Adige, Sudtirol region,
   northern Italy, extensive field measurements were carried out to
   characterize the area in terms of soil moisture variability, vegetation
   cover and soil properties. The area is equipped with 17 meteorological
   stations that also provide information on soil moisture on an hourly
   basis. To deal with the process of soil moisture retrieval from SAR
   images in this challenging environment, an advanced algorithm based on
   the support vector regression (SVR) technique and the integration of
   ancillary data were successfully proposed. The selected method was also
   combined with an innovative multi-objective strategy for model
   selection. The results indicate that the use of polarimetric features
   such as horizontal-horizontal polarization (HH) and horizontal-vertical
   polarization (HV) channels improves the estimation of SMC in the
   mountain area investigated, in particular because the HV channel
   contributes to disentangling the effect of vegetation on the radar
   signal. The root mean square error (RMSE) indicates accuracy of
   retrieval for soil moisture values of around 5\%, which is well within
   the requirements for estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed data.
   This work was carried out with the main aim of demonstrating the
   feasibility of soil moisture retrieval in mountain areas with
   high-resolution images in view of the upcoming Sentinel 1 mission.},

Abstract = {Despite the importance of the coupling between vegetation dynamics and
   root-zone soil moisture in land-atmosphere interactions, there is no
   land data assimilation system (LDAS) that currently addresses this
   issue, limiting the capacity to positively impact weather and seasonal
   forecasting. We develop a new LDAS that can improve the skill of an
   ecohydrological model to simulate simultaneously surface soil moisture,
   root-zone soil moisture, and vegetation dynamics by assimilating passive
   microwave observations that are sensitive to both surface soil moisture
   and terrestrial biomass. This LDAS first calibrates both hydrological
   and ecological parameters of a land surface model, which explicitly
   simulates vegetation growth and senescence. Then, it adjusts the model
   states of soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) sequentially using a
   genetic particle filter. We can adjust the subsurface soil moisture,
   which is not observed directly by satellites, because we simulate the
   interactions between vegetation dynamics and subsurface water dynamics.
   From a point-scale evaluation, we succeed in improving the performance
   of our land surface model and generate ensembles of the model state
   whose distribution reflects the combined information in the land surface
   model and satellite observations. We show that the adjustment of the
   subsurface soil moisture significantly improves the capacity to simulate
   vegetation dynamics in seasonal forecast timescales. This LDAS can
   contribute to the generation of ensemble initial conditions of surface
   and subsurface soil moisture and LAI for a probabilistic framework of
   weather and seasonal forecasting.},

Abstract = {Initial catchment state, such as soil moisture, strongly controls
   rainfall-runoff transformation processes. However, due to the high
   spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, point measurements
   may not always be suitable to represent the actual system state of a
   whole catchment as required in distributed catchment modelling. In this
   study a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang
   approach has been developed using soil moisture and rainfall as input
   variables to predict the actual discharge at the catchment outlet. Four
   soil moisture probes from the hydrological test site Durreych (Black
   Forest, southwest Germany) were selected, each of them representing a
   particular runoff generation process (saturation excess flow,
   infiltration excess flow, slow and fast interflow, return flow). After
   manual calibration, the simulated peak discharges were very similar to
   the measured values. Furthermore, the pattern of rule activation in the
   FRBS reflected the complex, highly nonlinear behaviour of the catchment.
   Thus, in the FRBS framework, the measurements of soil moisture at
   representative locations could be used as representation for the actual
   system state, allowing for an entirely data-driven prediction of the
   runoff response using rainfall.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {200},
Pages = {1-17},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study presents indexes developed from remote sensing observations
   for continuous soil surface moisture monitoring. The Modified
   Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) proposed in our earlier
   work is developed using a time domain solution method rather than the
   traditional spatial domain solution method, because of limitations
   arising from a traditional temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method. In
   the procedure herein proposed, the MTVDI parameterization scheme is
   transformed from regional scale to pixel scale, and the boundary
   conditions defining maximum water stress are determined pixel by pixel
   using the surface energy balance principle. All the parameters required
   for the retrieval of MTVDI are pixel specific, thereby avoiding the
   limitations of the traditional spatial domain solution method. Previous
   studies demonstrate the applicability of the TVX method with data from
   only a few days of clear sky conditions. In contrast, our proposed MTVDI
   is demonstrated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
   (MODIS) products over the course of a full year, and the soil moisture
   status over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region is monitored
   continuously. Finally, the volumetric surface soil water content
   (theta(nu)) is estimated using a calibration procedure from the MTVDI
   retrievals. The results show that the accuracy of both MTVDI retrievals
   and theta(nu) estimates obtained in this work has reached a level
   comparable with those produced in previous studies. Across all sites,
   the correlation coefficient (r) between the MTVDI and theta(nu)
   measurements is 0.60. The values of r, mean absolute error (MAE) and
   root mean square error (RMSE) for theta(nu) estimates are 0.75, 0.019
   m(3) M-3 and 0.025 m(3) m(-3), respectively.},

Abstract = {The objective of this work was to evaluate the impact of grazing
   intensities after 11 years of an integrated crop-livestock system, under
   no-tillage, on soil moisture and soybean physiological parameters during
   a summer season affected by drought. The experiment was established in
   2001 on a Rhodic Hapludox. Treatments consisted in the succession of
   soybean (summer) and a mixed pasture of black oat + Italian ryegrass
   (winter), under different beef-cattle grazing intensities: intensive
   grazing, with 0.10-m pasture height; moderate grazing, with 0.20-m
   pasture height; and no grazing. During the soybean cycle, in the
   2011/2012 crop season, rainfall was 40\% of the climatological normal.
   The soil moisture was within the limits of available water both under
   moderate grazing and no grazing, at 0.00-0.50-m soil depth, but, under
   intensive grazing, it was below the permanent wilting point, especially
   up to the grazing height of 0.20 m. Intensive grazing affected
   negatively the plant physiology parameters, reaching peaks of -2.5 MPa
   and + 6 degrees C for leaf water potential and leaf-air temperature
   difference, respectively. Moderate grazing or the absence of grazing,
   during the winter season, results in similar physiological responses,
   contributing to soybean plant homeostasis.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture status in the root zone is an important component of the
   water cycle at all spatial scales (e.g., point, field, catchment,
   watershed, and region). In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of
   root zone soil moisture of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed
   (WGEW) in Arizona was investigated during the Soil Moisture Experiment
   2004 (SMEX04). Root zone soil moisture was estimated via assimilation of
   aircraft-based remotely sensed surface soil moisture into a distributed
   Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. An ensemble square root filter
   (EnSRF) based on a Kalman filtering scheme was used for assimilating the
   aircraft-based soil moisture observations at a spatial resolution of 800
   m x 800 m. The SWAP model inputs were derived from the SSURGO soil
   database, LAI (Leaf Area Index) data from SMEX04 database, and data from
   meteorological stations/rain gauges at the WGEW. Model predictions are
   presented in terms of temporal evolution of soil moisture probability
   density function at various depths across the WGEW. The assimilation of
   the remotely sensed surface soil moisture observations had limited
   influence on the profile soil moisture. More specifically, root zone
   soil moisture depended mostly on the soil type. Modeled soil moisture
   profile estimates were compared to field measurements made periodically
   during the experiment at the ground based soil moisture stations in the
   watershed. Comparisons showed that the ground-based soil moisture
   observations at various depths were within +/-1 standard deviation of
   the modeled profile soil moisture. Density plots of root zone soil
   moisture at various depths in the WGEW exhibited multi-modal variations
   due to the uneven distribution of precipitation and the heterogeneity of
   soil types and soil layers across the watershed. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {The collocation technique has become a popular tool in oceanography and
   hydrology for estimating the error variances of different data sources
   such as in situ sensors, models and remote sensing products. It is also
   possible to determine calibration constants, for example to account for
   an off-set between the data sources. So far, the temporal
   autocorrelation structure of the errors has not been studied, although
   it is known that it has detrimental effects on the results of the
   collocation technique, in particular when calibration constants are also
   determined. This paper shows how the (triple) collocation estimators can
   be adapted to retrieve the autocovariance functions; the statistical
   properties as well as the structural deficencies are described. The
   coupling between the autocorrelation of the error and the estimation of
   calibration constants is studied in detail, due to its importance for
   analysing temporal changes. In soil moisture applications, such time
   variations can be induced, for example, by seasonal changes in the
   vegetation cover, which affect both models and remote sensing products.
   The limitations of the proposed technique associated with these
   considerations are analysed using remote sensing and in situ soil
   moisture data. The variability of the inter-sensor calibration and the
   autocovariance are shown to be closely related to temporal patterns of
   the data.},

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Solar-powered irrigation systems are becoming increasingly widespread.
   However, the initial setup costs of these systems are very high. To
   reduce these costs, both the energy usage and the prevention of losses
   from irrigation systems are very important. In this study, a drip
   irrigation control system of 1000 dwarf cherry trees was controlled
   using soil moisture sensors in order to prevent excessive water
   consumption and energy losses in a solar-powered irrigation system. The
   control system comprises units that are energized with solar panels, and
   the flow of information is implemented via radio frequency. Thus, by
   removing the cables that create difficulties in the cultivation of
   gardens, both the easy cultivation of the soil is enabled and cable
   costs are eliminated. The portability of the units is enabled by using
   solar energy; thus, units might be mounted wherever the user wishes. It
   has been indicated that the moisture of the application area varies
   depending on the data obtained regarding volumetric water content and
   the de fined area in need of irrigation. In this way, there are
   reductions in the dependence on instantaneous water demand, the amount
   of water to be pumped, and the energy requirements needed for
   irrigation. In addition, pump power and the power of the motor that
   drives the pump are also reduced. According to the obtained measurement
   values, it was calculated that hourly water demand decreased by 36\%.
   Thus, the numbers of solar panels, electrical machines, batteries, and
   units of power control that supply all the energy of the system and
   constitute a large part of the initial setup costs are reduced at the
   same rate by means of the applied technique. Thanks to the developed
   site-specific irrigation system, unnecessary energy consumption was
   avoided. Along with the elimination of excessive and unnecessary
   irrigation, problems with trees were also eliminated.},

Abstract = {Agricultural drought differs from meteorological, hydrological, and
   socioeconomic drought, being closely related to soil water availability
   in the root zone, specifically for crop and crop growth stage. In
   previous studies, several soil moisture indices (e.g., the soil moisture
   index, soil water deficit index) based on soil water availability have
   been developed for agricultural drought monitoring. However, when
   developing these indices, it was generally assumed that soil water
   availability to crops was equal throughout the root zone, and the
   effects of root distribution and crop growth stage on soil water uptake
   were ignored. This article aims to incorporate root distribution into a
   soil moisture-based index and to evaluate the performance of the
   improved soil moisture index for agricultural drought monitoring. The
   Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China was used as the study area. Overall, soil
   moisture indices were significantly correlated with the crop moisture
   index (CMI), and the improved root-weighted soil moisture index (RSMI)
   was more closely related to the CMI than averaged soil moisture indices.
   The RSMI correctly identified most of the observed drought events and
   performed well in the detection of drought levels. Furthermore, the RSMI
   had a better performance than averaged soil moisture indices when
   compared to crop yield. In conclusion, soil moisture indices could
   improve agricultural drought monitoring by incorporating root
   distribution.},

Abstract = {Short-term agricultural drought and longer term hydrological drought
   have important ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Soil moisture
   monitoring networks have potential to assist in the quantification of
   drought conditions because soil moisture changes are mostly due to
   precipitation and evapotranspiration, the two dominant water balance
   components in most areas. In this study, the Palmer approach to
   calculating a drought index was combined with a soil water content-based
   moisture anomaly calculation. A drought lag time parameter was
   introduced to quantify the time between the start of a moisture anomaly
   and the onset of drought. The methodology was applied to four shortgrass
   prairie sites along a North-South transect in the U.S. Great Plains with
   an 18-year soil moisture record. Short time lags led to high periodicity
   of the resulting drought index, appropriate for assessing short-term
   drought conditions at the field scale (agricultural drought).
   Conversely, long time lags led to low periodicity of the drought index,
   being more indicative of long-term drought conditions at the watershed
   or basin scale (hydrological drought). The influence of daily, weekly,
   and monthly time steps on the drought index was examined and found to be
   marginal. The drought index calculated with a short drought lag time
   showed evidence of being normally distributed. A longer data record is
   needed to assess the statistical distribution of the drought index for
   longer drought lag times.},

Volume = {29},

Abstract = {Soil moisture has important implications for meteorology, climatology,
   hydrology, and agriculture. This has led to growing interest in
   development of in situ soil moisture monitoring networks. Measurement
   interpretation is severely limited without soil property data. In North
   Carolina, soil moisture has been monitored since 1999 as a routine
   parameter in the statewide Environment and Climate Observing Network
   (ECONet), but with little soils information available for ECONet sites.
   The objective of this paper is to provide soils data for ECONet
   development. The authors studied soil physical properties at 27 ECONet
   sites and generated a database with 13 soil physical parameters,
   including sand, silt, and clay contents; bulk density; total porosity;
   saturated hydraulic conductivity; air-dried water content; and water
   retention at six pressures. Soil properties were highly variable among
   individual ECONet sites {[}coefficients of variation (CVs) ranging from
   12\% to 80\%]. This wide range of properties suggests very different
   behavior among sites with respect to soil moisture. A principal
   component analysis indicated parameter groupings associated primarily
   with soil texture, bulk density, and air-dried water content accounted
   for 80\% of the total variance in the dataset. These results suggested
   that a few specific soil properties could be measured to provide an
   understanding of differences in sites with respect to major soil
   properties. The authors also illustrate how the measured soil properties
   have been used to develop new soil moisture products and data screening
   for the North Carolina ECONet. The methods, analysis, and results
   presented here have applications to North Carolina and for other regions
   with heterogeneous soils where soil moisture monitoring is valuable.},

   Integrated Forecast System and the TMI soil moisture data set},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2007},

Month = {FEB 9},
Abstract = {Satellite-derived surface soil moisture data sets are readily available
   and have been used successfully in hydrological applications. In many
   operational numerical weather prediction systems the initial soil
   moisture conditions are analyzed from the modeled background and 2 m
   temperature and relative humidity. This approach has proven its
   efficiency to improve surface latent and sensible heat fluxes and
   consequently the forecast on large geographical domains. However, since
   soil moisture is not always related to screen level variables, model
   errors and uncertainties in the forcing data can accumulate in root zone
   soil moisture. Remotely sensed surface soil moisture is directly linked
   to the model's uppermost soil layer and therefore is a stronger
   constraint for the soil moisture analysis. For this study, three data
   assimilation experiments with the Integrated Forecast System ( IFS) of
   the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) have been
   performed for the 2-month period of June and July 2002: a control run
   based on the operational soil moisture analysis, an open loop run with
   freely evolving soil moisture, and an experimental run incorporating TMI
   (TRMM Microwave Imager) derived soil moisture over the southern United
   States. In this experimental run the satellite-derived soil moisture
   product is introduced through a nudging scheme using 6-hourly
   increments. Apart from the soil moisture analysis, the system setup
   reflects the operational forecast configuration including the
   atmospheric 4D-Var analysis. Soil moisture analyzed in the nudging
   experiment is the most accurate estimate when compared against in situ
   observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet. The corresponding forecast for 2
   m temperature and relative humidity is almost as accurate as in the
   control experiment. Furthermore, it is shown that the soil moisture
   analysis influences local weather parameters including the planetary
   boundary layer height and cloud coverage.},

Title = {Bioclimatic and Soil Moisture Monitoring Across Elevation in a Mountain
   Watershed: Opportunities for Research and Resource Management},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {2493-2503},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil moisture data are critical to understanding biophysical and
   societal impacts of climate change. However, soil moisture data
   availability is limited due to sparse in situ monitoring, particularly
   in mountain regions. Here we present methods, specifications, and
   initial results from the interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network
   (iRON), a soil, weather, and ecological monitoring system in the
   Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Initiated in 2012, the network is
   currently composed of nine stations, distributed in elevation from 1,890
   to 3,680m, that continually collect and transmit measurements of soil
   moisture at three depths (5, 20, and 50cm), soil temperature (20cm), and
   meteorological conditions. Time-lapse cameras for phenological
   observations, snow depth sensors, and periodic co-located vegetation
   surveys complement selected stations. iRON was conceived and designed
   with the joint purpose of supporting bioclimatic research and resource
   management objectives in a snow-dominated watershed. In the short term,
   iRON data can be applied to assessing the impact of temperature and
   precipitation on seasonal soil moisture conditions and trends. As more
   data are collected over time, iRON will help improve understanding of
   climate-driven changes to soil, vegetation, and hydrologic conditions.
   In presenting this network and its initial data, we hope that the
   network's elevational gradient will contribute to bioclimatic mountain
   research, while active collaboration with partners in resource
   management may provide a model for science-practice interaction in
   support of long-term monitoring.
   Plain Language Summary As climate change drives shifts in temperature
   and precipitation, researchers and resource managers can benefit from
   improved monitoring of soil moisture. Understanding the relationship
   between soil moisture and other system components is crucial to
   improving water availability projections and understanding ecosystem
   responses to climate change. Despite their significance, in-ground
   soil-moisture measurements are often not available across multiple
   elevations within a single watershed. This paper presents a network in
   the Southern Rocky Mountains intended to help address this data gap and
   compliment data from other networks. The interactive Roaring Fork
   Observation Network consists of nine locations across an 1,800-m change
   in elevation. Each station measures soil moisture at three depths, soil
   temperature, air temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Some stations
   are equipped with cameras or snow depth gauges, and for eight sites
   vegetation surveys are conducted. The data are available through a
   simple data portal. The network was established with local resource
   manager support, and one of its guiding purposes is to support
   management and restoration planning efforts. Because of the network's
   ongoing monitoring across multiple elevations and habitats, interactive
   Roaring Fork Observation Network will provide researchers and resource
   managers with access to valuable information about changes in soil
   conditions in a changing climate.},

Title = {A method to downscale soil moisture to fine resolutions using
   topographic, vegetation, and soil data},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {76},
Pages = {81-96},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Soil moisture can be estimated over large regions with spatial
   resolutions greater than 500 m, but many applications require finer
   resolutions (10-100 m). Several methods use topographic data to
   downscale, but vegetation and soil patterns can also be important. In
   this paper, a downscaling model that uses fine- resolution topographic,
   vegetation, and soil data is presented. The method is tested at the
   Cache la Poudre catchment where detailed vegetation and soil data were
   collected. Additional testing is performed at the Tarrawarra and
   Nerrigundah catchments where limited soil data are available. Downscaled
   soil moisture patterns at Cache la Poudre improve when vegetation and
   soil data are used, and model performance is similar to an EOF method.
   Using interpolated soil data at Tarrawarra and Nerrigundah decreases
   model performance and results in worse performance than an EOF method,
   suggesting that soil data needs greater spatial detail and accuracy to
   be useful for downscaling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Remotely sensed thermal inertia method has been recognized as a
   promising approach for land surface soil moisture retrieval from the
   early 1970's. In order to estimate the land surface soil moisture in
   arid regions, a real thermal inertia (RTI) model was formulated based on
   the heat conduction equation and an approximated energy budget equation
   at the land surface using the land surface temperature and reflectance
   measured by Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The
   soil thermal inertia of Heihe River Basin (HRB) was retrieved based on
   the RTI model. Furthermore, using a thermal inertia-soil moisture model
   along with auxiliary data such as soil texture and bulk density, land
   surface soil moisture was estimated. The results were verified
   experimentally using the observations made at three automatic weather
   stations (AWS). The coefficient of the correlation between the retrieved
   values of soil thermal inertia and measured ones was with above R = 0.6
   and the root mean square error of soil moisture was 0.072 m(3) m(-3).
   The soil moisture in the HRB exhibits a seasonal variation with higher
   values in summer and autumn and lower values in winter and spring, and
   also exhibits considerable spatial variation with higher values in the
   upstream district and lower values in the downstream district.},

   Mean comparison and the subsequent stepwise multiple regression were

   stepwise multiple regression were used to predict the soil moisture.
   Results indicated that the general model could predict the soil moisture
   with mean absolute error of less than 1.1\%. This value reached to 0.3\%
   for some sub-models belonging to the texture-organic matter group.
   Application of the present method is highly recommended for soil

Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {235},
Pages = {323-328},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Carbon dioxide flux to the atmosphere is the major pathway whereby
   carbon is lost from agricultural soils. Linear interpolation has
   traditionally been used to estimate soil CO2 flux in lab-based studies
   but the resulting curves are not representative of biological systems.
   The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of linear,
   natural cubic spline and constrained cubic spline interpolation models
   for estimating CO2 flux from contrasting soils under different
   management regimes. Cross-validation techniques were employed to examine
   the predictive accuracy, overshoot/undershoot behavior, smoothness and
   deviation of cumulative CO2 flux estimates of each approach. The
   predictive accuracy of the interpolation models differed with soil type
   and between amended and unamended soils. Predictive accuracy also
   decreased with increased interval length though being sensitive to the
   nature of the region being estimated. Linear interpolation accurately
   predicted most measured data points and had a low spread of potential
   cumulative CO2 flux values (between 154\% and -54\%) but produced
   non-smooth curves. Natural cubic spline interpolation produced
   relatively smooth curves but had low predictive accuracy and high
   variability in potential cumulative CO2 flux values (between 528\% and
   -617\%). Constrained cubic spline interpolation produced the smoothest
   curves while its predictive accuracy and spread of potential cumulative
   CO2 flux (between 175\% and -53\%) was comparable to that of linear
   interpolation. These results demonstrate that the constrained cubic
   spline interpolation technique offers improvements over linear
   interpolation for estimating soil CO2 flux. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {The soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role in plant growth and
   development, and therefore is considered as one of the most important
   indicators of soil quality. This study was carried out in the central
   region of Saudi Arabia to explore the potential of spectroscopy in
   determining the SOC concentration in low-fertility soils. Spectral
   reflectance data were collected, under the controlled laboratory
   conditions on 39 air-dried 2.0 mm sieved soil samples, using a handheld
   spectroradiometer of a wavelength range between 350 nm and 2500 nm in
   the direct contact probe mode. The concentration of the SOC was
   determined using the Walkley and Black (W\&B) and the UV-VIS
   spectrophotometric methods. The increase in the concentration of SOC was
   associated with a decrease in the corresponding spectral reflectance.
   Regression analysis showed linear relationships with high significant
   correlation between the spectral reflectance and the SOC measured by
   both the UV-VIS (Model-1: R-2 =0.46, p=0.00015 and RMSE=6.6 g/kg) and
   the W\&B (Model-2: R-2 =0.48, p=8.92E-05 and RMSE= 2.8 g/kg) methods.
   For these models, two wavebands with wavelengths of 2167 nm (Model-1)
   and 1359 nm (Model-2) were identified as the most sensitive bands to the
   SOC concentration. The cross-validation confirmed the validity of
   Model-1 with R-2, p and RMSE values of 0.50, 0.0099 and 6.6 g/kg,
   respectively. The validation results of the Model-2 showed values of
   R-2, p and RMSE of 0.72, 0.00023 and 4.0 g/kg, respectively. Results of
   this study revealed the possibility and the potential of using the
   spectral reflectance technique in predicting the concentration of SOC.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted at the research farm of U.P. Council of
   Sugarcane Research, Shahjahanpur, India for two consecutive years during
   autumn seasons of 2007-2009 and 2008-2010 to compare modified trench
   method of sugarcane planting with other prevalent planting methods for
   its production potentiality and uptake of nutrients and soil fertility
   status. The experiment consisting of five planting method treatments
   viz., conventional furrow planting at 90 cm apart (T-1), deep furrow (20
   cm) planting at 90 cm apart covering setts with 2.5 cm of soil layer
   (T-2), paired row furrow planting at 120:60:120 cm (T-3), paired row
   deep furrow (20 cm) planting at 120:60:120 cm covering setts with 2.5 cm
   of soil layer (T-4) and modified trench planting at 120 cm apart placing
   setts across the furrow and covering them with 2.5 cm of soil layer
   (T-5) was laid out in randomized block design with five replications.
   Experimental results revealed that cane yield obtained under modified
   trench method of planting was 18.72, 23.87, 21.22, and 27.01 \% higher
   than that of T-4, T-3, T-2, and T-1 treatments, respectively.
   Significantly highest uptake of N, P, and K (168.60, 87.31, and 254.46
   kg/ha, respectively) was noticed under modified trench method of
   planting. The soil fertility status of soil observed initially and after
   the harvest of sugarcane crop clearly indicated positive effect of
   modified trench method of planting on soil fertility status. Thus, a
   favourable soil fertility helped better uptake of nutrients and cane
   growth, which ultimately resulted in higher cane yield under modified
   trench method of sugarcane planting.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we presents a new soil moisture sensor that is based on
   SWR (Standing Wave Ratio) theory which is a different dielectric
   property method from TDR (Time Domain Reflectometry) technique. To test
   the performance of SWR sensor, we made a comparative experiment of SWR
   sensor and TDR sensor. A series of soil cylinders of specific
   gravimetric soil moisture were made in the laboratory. The volumetric
   soil moisture of soil cylinders was measured with SWR sensor and TDR
   sensor, meanwhile, the real soil moisture of soil cylinders was
   determined by gravimetric method. The experiments used loam and sandy
   soil. An analysis of the data gathered in the experiment shows that SWR
   sensor and TDR sensor both have a high measurement precision compared
   with gravimetric results, but soil type influence of SWR sensor in sandy
   soil is a little higher than TDR sensor. As a relatively simple and
   low-cost sensor, the precision of SWR sensor is high enough to satisfy
   the requirement of practical application.},

Title = {A simple assimilation method to ingest satellite soil moisture into a

Volume = {23},

Abstract = {Recently several studies discussed the potential and operational use of
   satellite soil moisture measurements in new land surface analysis
   feeding global Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. This work
   seeks to establish whether a limited-area NWP model might benefit from
   the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture data. The question is
   important because it is well known that even small errors in the initial
   conditions could amplify in the future states and lead to erroneous
   predictions. On the other hand, remotely sensed soil moisture
   observations are attractive because they offer a synoptic point of view
   and their reliability with respect to in-situ measurements is
   demonstrated.
   The authors used a simple nudging scheme in order to assimilate remotely
   sensed soil moisture data into a limited-area NWP model. This
   assimilation method is computationally cheap and simple to implement.
   Its impact on numerical outputs is evaluated with respect to a control
   simulation performed without assimilation. Results obtained in both
   simulations are validated with in-situ soil moisture measurements and
   with 2-meter temperature observations. Results demonstrate the benefits
   of the assimilation especially in those remote areas where the coverage
   of observational instruments is poor and where the irregularity of
   observations implies interpolation errors when reporting data on a
   regular grid. As found in bibliography, in well monitored areas the
   impact of the assimilation is almost neutral.},

Title = {Climate at ecologically relevant scales: A new temperature and soil
   moisture logger for long-term microclimate measurement},
Journal = {AGRICULTURAL AND FOREST METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {268},
Pages = {40-47},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Climate measurements are needed at a scale at which organisms live and
   die. Currently available climate sensors, however, are not well suited
   for long-term field measurements at such a scale. We have therefore
   developed a new temperature and moisture logger, the
   Temperature-Moisture-Sensor (TMS), which we designed for a wide range of
   ecological applications. The device mimics a small herbaceous plant. Its
   belowground part houses a patented, proprietary soil moisture sensor
   working on the time-domain transmission principle. Air, surface and soil
   temperatures are measured simultaneously by three independent sensors.
   The TMS data logger has a large memory and long battery life, so it is
   suitable for taking long-term microclimate measurements in the field.
   With a data acquisition interval of 15 min, it has sufficient memory to
   last for almost 15 years.
   We have thoroughly tested the TMS logger both in the laboratory and in
   demanding field conditions ranging from tropical rain forests of Africa
   to high-elevation cold deserts of the Himalayas. The device has provided
   microclimate measurements in a wide range of environmental conditions
   and has also performed well in controlled laboratory settings.
   The key added value of the TMS logger is that it concurrently measures
   soil moisture as well as soil, surface and air temperature at a
   biologically relevant scale. It is also able to continuously measure the
   microclimate for several years even in the most extreme conditions. The
   device can therefore be used to build extensive tailored field
   measurement networks providing crucial data about microclimate
   conditions shaping biological processes in the face of climate change.},

Title = {Estimation of groundwater recharge using the soil moisture budget method

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {Estimation of groundwater recharge is extremely important for proper
   management of groundwater systems. Many different approaches exist for
   estimating recharge. The main purpose of this paper is to apply a water
   balance concept with two methods to estimate the groundwater recharge in
   the Ching-Shui watershed, Taiwan. First, a soil moisture budget method
   is established to estimate the infiltration, runoff, evapotranspiration,
   and groundwater recharge in the watershed, where the moisture content of
   the soil is tracked through time. Both soil-water properties of the
   unsaturated zone and climatic conditions must be fully considered.
   Second the base-flow model uses the base-flow separation from the total
   streamflow discharge to obtain a measure of groundwater recharge so that
   groundwater evapotranspiration is negligible. In contrast to the soil
   moisture budget method, base-flow estimation does not require complex
   hydrogeologic modeling and detailed knowledge of soil characteristics.
   In a previous study, we suggested that high base-flow is caused by
   rainstorm events. Using model analysis, depths of recharge estimated by
   stable-base-flow analysis are adopted to obtain more reasonable
   groundwater recharge values. The results indicate that assessment of the
   average annual recharge obtained with a soil moisture budget and the
   base-flow are very close; the ratio of the two methods is about 95.3\%.},

Abstract = {In this study a prototype sensor-based platform moving inside a
   subsurface network of pipes with the task of monitoring the soil
   moisture content is presented. It comprises of a mobile platform, a
   modified commercial soil moisture sensor (Diviner 2000), a network of
   subsurface polyvinylchloride (PVC) access pipes, driving hardware and
   image processing software. The software allows the composition of
   two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) images with high accuracy
   and at a large scale. The 3D soil moisture images are created by using
   2D slices for better illustration of the soil moisture variability.
   Three case studies of varying soil moisture content using an
   experimental soil tank were examined. In the first case study, the
   irrigation water was applied uniformly on the entire tank surface. In
   second and third case studies, the irrigation water was applied
   uniformly only on the surface of the intermediate and last part of the
   soil tank respectively. The processed images give a detailed description
   of the soil moisture distribution of a layer at 15 cm depth under the
   soil surface in the tank. In all case studies that have been
   investigated, the distribution of soil moisture was characterized by a
   significant variability (difference between poorly and well-drained
   regions) of the soil tank. A very poorly-drained region was located in
   the middle of the soil tank, while well-drained soil areas were located
   southwest and northeast. The knowledge of the spatial and temporal
   distribution of soil moisture is a valuable tool for proper management
   of crop irrigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The soil freezing characteristic (SFC) plays a critical role in modeling
   the transport of water, heat, and solutes in frozen soil. Especially,
   the SFC can be used to estimate the soil moisture characteristic (SMC)
   for unfrozen soil due to the known similarity between them. In this
   study, we tested an existing portable dielectric tube sensor in vertical
   access tubes together with a set of temperature sensors for the
   determination of the in situ SFC and SMC. The experiment was conducted
   at three sites with sandy, loamy, and silt loam soils. At each site,
   three SFC curves were obtained at depths of 15, 25, and 35 cm. The
   resulting SMCs estimated from the SFCs were compared with the SMCs
   determined using a pressure plate apparatus. The data from the proposed
   method and those of the pressure plate fit the Campbell model with 0.806
   <= R-2 <= 0.994 and fit the van Genuchten model with 0.638 <= R-2 <=
   0.994. The coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.837) and RMSE (131 kPa)
   showed a good agreement between the characteristic curves from the two
   methods. Thus, we recommend the dielectric tube sensor for determining
   the SFC in situ and inferring the SMC across depths.},

   lysimeters in plots with conventional irrigation scheduling. Even though
   losses of mineral nitrogen via leaching were extremely small (
   representing only 1.1\% of the total nitrogen applied to conventionally
   irrigated plots), losses were significantly lower in the sensor-

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown the importance of soil moisture (SM) in
   estimating crop yield potential (YP). The sensor based nitrogen (N) rate
   calculator (SBNRC) developed by Oklahoma State University utilizes the
   Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the in-season
   estimated yield (INSEY) as the estimate of biomass to assess YP and to
   generate N recommendations based on estimated crop need. The objective
   was to investigate whether including the SM parameter into SBNRC could
   help to increase the accuracy of YP prediction and improve N rate
   recommendations. Two experimental sites (Lahoma and Perkins) in Oklahoma
   were established in 2006/07 and 2007/08. Wheat spectral reflectance was
   measured using a GreenSeeker (TM) 505 hand-held optical sensor (N-Tech
   Industries, Ukiah, CA). Soil-water content measured with matric
   potential 229-L sensors (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) was used to
   determine volumetric water content and fractional water index. The
   relationships between NDVI, INSEY and SM indices at planting and sensing
   at 5, 25, 60 and 75-cm depths versus grain yield (GY) were evaluated.
   Wheat GY, NDVI at Feekes 5 and soil WC at planting and as sensed at
   three depths were also analyzed for eight consecutive growing seasons
   (1999-2006) for Lahoma. Incorporation of SM into NDVI and INSEY
   calculations resulted in equally good prediction of wheat GY for all
   site-years. This indicates that NDVI alone was able to account for the
   lack of SM information and thus lower crop YP. Soil moisture data,
   especially at the time of sensing at the 5-cm depth could assist in
   refining winter wheat YP prediction.},

   A methodology was developed to integrate the individual nutrient layers

   was shown. In the wetting process, soil water infiltrated in the liquid
   phase, while the soil water was in the vapor phase during the drying
   process. As the first step of the drying process, the surface ground at
   both depths rapidly and thoroughly dried by evaporation due to the
   daytime soil temperature increase. As the second step, the soil water
   evaporated predominantly from the shallower depth. However, because of
   the supply of water vapor from deeper soil, saturated conditions
   continued at 0.01 m depth. As the third step, the surface ground
   gradually dried, repeated diurnal variations in humidity of soil air
   resulted from the decreased supply of water vapor from deeper soil. Once
   soil water was supplied in the soil at the gobi site, soil water and
   water vapor of soil air at 0.05 m depth were not easy to remove.},

Abstract = {The HYDRUS-2D simulation software has been used for irrigation
   management. Its performance under realistic irrigation regimes requires
   evaluation with new methodologies that integrate larger soil volumes,
   because soil water content is highly variable in time, space and scale.
   We compare direct measurements in a sloping field environment under drip
   irrigation with simulation using HYDRUS-2D. An advanced mobile sensor
   technology is used to track the dynamics of soil water content, and thus
   of unsaturated flow, at 0.25 m and 0.50 m depth in a field plot (6 m x 3
   m; 4 degrees slope) beneath two parallel (0.5 m separation; 7 emitters
   per delivery tube) dripper arrays. We document an asynchronous sequence
   of wetting fronts driven by the sloping surface and capture the field
   results well using HYDRUS-2D, in the spatial (R-2 = 0.935-0.963, p <
   0.01, RMSE = 0.024-0.027 cm(3) cm (3)) and time (R-2 = 0.804-0.983, p <
   0.01, RMSE = 0.9-1.8 h) domains. In general, the HYDRUS-2D simulation
   system has potentially excellent capability for characterizing temporal
   moisture redistribution, tracking wetting front dynamics and predicting
   the time required for volumetric soil water content (VSWC) to reach
   field capacity under drip irrigation. Moreover, our study showed that
   the mobile dielectric sensor is a powerful tool to monitor infiltration
   of drip array irrigation both in spatial and time domains. (C) 2018

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a spatially heterogeneous quantity in the McMurdo Dry
   Valleys of Antarctica that exerts a large influence on the biological
   community and on the thermal state of Dry Valleys permafrost. The goal
   of this project was to determine whether hyperspectral remote sensing
   techniques could be used to determine soil moisture conditions in the
   Dry Valleys. We measured the spectral reflectance factors of wetted soil
   samples from the Dry Valleys under natural light conditions and related
   diagnostic spectral features to surface layer soil moisture content.
   Diagnostic water absorption features in the spectra at 1.4 mu m and 1.9
   mu m were present in all samples, including samples doped with high
   concentrations of chloride salts. The depth of the 1.4 mu m absorption
   is shown to increase linearly with increasing gravimetric water content.
   These results suggest that airborne hyperspectral imaging of the Dry
   Valleys could generate soil moisture maps of this environment over large
   spatial areas using non-invasive remote-sensing techniques.},

Title = {An intercomparison of available soil moisture estimates from thermal
   infrared and passive microwave remote sensing and land surface modeling},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-ATMOSPHERES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {116},
Month = {AUG 9},
Abstract = {Remotely sensed soil moisture studies have mainly focused on retrievals
   using active and passive microwave (MW) sensors, which provide
   measurements that are directly related to soil moisture (SM). MW sensors
   have obvious advantages such as the ability to retrieve through
   nonprecipitating cloud cover which provides shorter repeat cycles.
   However, MW sensors offer coarse spatial resolution and suffer from
   reduced retrieval skill over moderate to dense vegetation. A unique
   avenue for filling these information gaps is to exploit the retrieval of
   SM from thermal infrared (TIR) observations, which can provide SM
   information under vegetation cover and at significantly higher
   resolutions than MW. Previously, an intercomparison of TIR-based and
   MW-based SM has not been investigated in the literature. Here a series
   of analyses are proposed to study relationships between SM products
   during a multiyear period (2003-2008) from a passive MW retrieval
   (AMSR-E), a TIR based model (ALEXI), and a land surface model (Noah)
   over the continental United States. The three analyses used in this
   study include (1) a spatial anomaly correlation analysis, (2) a temporal
   correlation analysis, and (3) a triple collocation error estimation
   technique. In general, the intercomparison shows that the TIR and MW
   methods provide complementary information about the current SM state.
   TIR can provide SM information over moderate to dense vegetation, a
   large information gap in current MW methods, while serving as an
   additional independent source of SM information over low to moderate
   vegetation. The complementary nature of SM information from MW and TIR
   sensors implies a potential for integration within an advanced SM data
   assimilation system.},

Abstract = {Studies on Alnus rubra Bong. (red alder) were carried out to assess its
   potential for use as a component of a silvopastoral system. Comparison
   was between two treatments: red alder at 400 stems ha(-1) (silvopasture)
   and red alder at 2,500 stems ha(-1) (forestry control). delta N-15
   values close to zero were recorded in all red alder plant parts except
   for root nodules, indicating that a large proportion of N in red alder
   was fixed from the atmosphere. Overall, it was estimated that there was
   63.45 kg N ha(-1) fixed N accumulated in red alder trees, and the rate
   of N fixation was estimated at 30.95 kg ha(-1) year(-1) in the
   silvopasture treatment. The total amount of N that could potentially be
   added to the soil in the silvopasture treatment as a result of
   decomposition of senescent leaves, roots, and dead nodules was estimated
   at 40.56 kg ha(-1) year(-1). Of the total N added to the soil, 27.1 kg
   ha(-1) year(-1) was due to N fixation from the atmosphere. These results
   show that red alder has a potential to improve and maintain soil
   fertility in a silvopastoral system.},

Abstract = {Improvements in buried mine detection using remote sensing technology
   rest on understanding the effects on sensor response of spatial and
   temporal variability created by soil and environmental conditions.
   However, research efforts on mine detection have generally emphasized
   sensor development, while less effort has been made to evaluate the
   effects of the environmental conditions in which the mines are placed.
   If the processes governing moisture and temperature distribution near
   the ground surface can be captured, sensor development and deployment
   can be more realistically tailored to particular operational scenarios
   and technologies. The objective of this study is to investigate the
   effects of the soil environment on landmine detection by studying the
   influence of the thermal boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere
   interface and the buried objects themselves on the spatial and temporal
   distribution of soil moisture around shallow-buried objects. Two
   separate large tank experiments were performed with buried objects with
   different thermal properties. Experimental results were compared to
   results from a fully coupled heat and mass transfer numerical model.
   Comparison of experimental and numerical results suggests that the vapor
   enhancement factor used to adjust the vapor diffusive flux described
   based on Fick's law is not necessary under dry soil conditions. Data and
   simulations from this study show that the thermal signature of a buried
   object depends on the complex interaction among a soil's water content
   and its thermal and hydraulic properties. Simulated thermal and
   saturation contrasts were generally very different for a buried landmine
   than for other buried objects.},

Title = {Soil moisture in the root zone and its relation to plant vigor assessed
   by remote sensing at management scale},
Journal = {GEODERMA},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {91-95},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Vegetation index derived from satellite data can be indirectly utilized
   for obtaining information on moisture in the soil root zone in cropped
   areas, considering that the soil profile moisture in many regions of the
   world is the main factor controlling plant vigor. In this context, the
   aims of this work were: (i) to verify the relationship between moisture
   in the soil profile (until 100-cm depth) and the vigor of the plant, as
   measured by Vegetation Index EVI-2, (ii) to identify which is the plant
   vigor response time delay for soil moisture at different depths of the
   profile, (iii) to propose linear equations for estimating soil moisture
   by EVI-2, and (iv) to test the hypothesis that is possible to identify,
   with the aid of the EVI-2, which soil depth can be considered the
   effective depth of water absorption by plants. Data were collected in a
   coffee crop area at Sao Roque de Minas, Upper Sao Francisco River basin,
   Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The soil moisture was measured with a
   multi-sensor capacitance (MCP) probe, from March to December, 2010, and
   the coffee plant vigor was evaluated by Vegetation Index EVI-2. It was
   verified a correlation between vegetative vigor of coffee plants and
   soil moisture in the root zone. Linear equations were generated to
   estimate soil moisture in this zone using vegetation indexes at soil
   management scale (soil profile explored by the crop). There is a
   response time delay of coffee vigor to soil moisture, and this time
   varies according to depth and water content in the soil profile. The
   highest correlation was obtained at a depth of 60 cm, indicating that
   this depth is the one that best reflects the plant's water status. (C)

Abstract = {Dielectric soil moisture sensors have the potential for nondestructive
   and real- time monitoring of the stem water content (theta(st)) of
   living trees. This study was conducted to investigate the water use
   characteristics of trees in drylands through monitoring of qst using
   newly developed capacitance sensors (GS3). The plants used for data
   collection were Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (mesquite, invasive) in
   Sudan and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (tamarisk, invasive) and Prosopis
   pubescens Benth.(screwbean mesquite, native) in the United States. The
   GS3 probes were installed into the trunks of two trees for each species.
   Stem-specific calibration equations and temperature calibration
   equations were derived through laboratory experiments and analysis of
   field observation data. The temperature calibration equations reduced
   inappropriate variations of qst caused by daily fluctuations in stem
   temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct
   interpretation of monitoring data of qst in arid environments. The qst
   of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall
   events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close
   to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use
   soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered
   to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The qst of neither species in
   the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that
   they depend on shallow saline groundwater. The qst of the tamarisk
   decreased monotonically throughout the monitoring period, apparently in
   response to feeding damage caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diohabda
   sp.), which had been released for biological control of tamarisk.},

Abstract = {Conventional soil nutrient detection methods are time-consuming and
   laborious and cannot realize rapid measurement. Mid-infrared
   spectroscopy with the advantages of high detection speed,
   non-destructive testing, and a pretreatment-free process has been widely
   applied in soil nutrient analysis. In previous studies on the detection
   of soil compositions, diffuse reflection and attenuated total reflection
   are two commonly adopted ways in mid-infrared spectroscopy. In this
   paper, we developed a method which could simultaneously measure the
   infrared attenuated total reflection (ATR) and diffuse reflection
   infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of soils, in order to obtain
   more abundant spectral information. We analyzed and predicted the
   contents of organic matters, organic carbon and total nitrogen
   quantitatively in soils by using chemometrics. The results showed that
   after combining ATR spectra and DRIFT spectra, the MSC-processed PLS
   models allowed a higher prediction accuracy than that of using ATR or
   DRIFT spectra alone. The coefficients of determination of organic
   matters, organic carbon and total nitrogen models were 0.93, 0.952 and
   0.971, respectively. By combining ATR and DRIFT spectral information,
   the analytical ability of infrared spectroscopy was enhanced. This study
   provided a new method for the rapid measurement of soil nutrients.},

Abstract = {Land surface models and satellite remote sensing are among the modern
   soil moisture retrieval techniques that can be used over large areas.
   However, the lack of `ground truth' soil moisture measurements is still
   an obstacle in the evaluation and validation of soil moisture
   retrievals. In this study, a new scheme is used to assess soil moisture
   retrieval from both the NOAH Land surface Model (LSM) coupled with the
   fifth generation Mesoscale Model MM5 and the Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer AMSR-E. The proposed scheme is based on the strong
   correlation between changes in soil storage from rainfall runoff events
   and changes in the retrieved soil moisture either from the MM5-NOAH LSM
   or the AMSR-E. The aim of this study is to compare the application of
   the proposed scheme between these two different approaches for soil
   moisture estimation. The MM5-NOAH LSM provides soil moisture estimations
   at three different layers with depths 0-10 cm (surface layer 1), 10-40
   cm (layer 2) and 40-100 cm (layer 3). In this study, the combined soil
   moisture over the top two layers (first and second) and the combined
   soil moisture over the first three layers (first, second and third) are
   used to account for the entire soil column for assessing the estimated
   soil moisture using changes in the storage from the water balance. The
   results have shown that the MM5 soil moisture from the combined top two
   layers has the better performance than either of the individual layers
   when compared to the catchment water storage. The results also show that
   the MM5-NOAH LSM soil moisture estimates have a slightly better
   performance than the AMSR-E surface soil moisture measurement. This
   preliminary assessment shows the benefits of using hydrological data in
   the validation of soil moisture retrieval methods.},

Abstract = {A new physically based disaggregation method is developed to improve the
   spatial resolution of the surface soil moisture extracted from the Soil
   Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) data. The approach combines the 40-km
   resolution SMOS multiangular brightness temperatures and 1-km resolution
   auxiliary data composed of visible, near-infrared, and thermal infrared
   remote sensing data and all the surface variables involved in the
   modeling of land surface-atmosphere interaction available at this scale
   (soil texture, atmospheric forcing, etc.). The method successively
   estimates a relative spatial distribution of soil moisture with
   fine-scale auxiliary data, and normalizes this distribution at SMOS
   resolution with SMOS data. The main assumption relies on the
   relationship between the radiometric soil temperature inverted from the
   thermal infrared and the microwave soil moisture. Based on synthetic
   data generated with a land surface model, it is shown that the
   radiometric soil temperature can be used as a tracer of the spatial
   variability of the 0-5 cm soil moisture. A sensitivity analysis shows
   that the algorithm remains stable for big uncertainties in auxiliary
   data and that the uncertainty in SMOS observation seems to be the
   limiting factor. Finally, a simple application to the SGP97/AVHRR data
   illustrates the usefulness of the approach.},

Title = {Retrieval of an Available Water-Based Soil Moisture Proxy from Thermal
   Infrared Remote Sensing. Part I: Methodology and Validation},

Abstract = {A retrieval of available water fraction (f(AW)) is proposed using
   surface flux estimates from satellite-based thermal infrared (TIR)
   imagery and the Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inversion (ALEXI) model.
   Available water serves as a proxy for soil moisture conditions, where
   f(AW) can be converted to volumetric soil moisture through two soil
   texture dependents parameters-field capacity and permanent wilting
   point. The ability of ALEXI to provide valuable information about the
   partitioning of the surface energy budget, which can be largely dictated
   by soil moisture conditions, accommodates the retrieval of an average
   f(AW) over the surface to the rooting depth of the active vegetation.
   For this method, the fraction of actual to potential evapotranspiration
   (f(PET)) is computed from an ALEXI estimate of latent heat flux and
   potential evapotranspiration (PET). The ALEXI-estimated f(PET) can be
   related to f(AW) in the soil profile. Four unique f(PET) to f(AW)
   relationships are proposed and validated against Oklahoma Mesonet soil
   moisture observations within a series of composite periods during the
   warm seasons of 2002-04. Using the validation results, the most
   representative of the four relationships is chosen and shown to produce
   reasonable (mean absolute errors values less than 20\%) f(AW) estimates
   when compared to Oklahoma Mesonet observations. Quantitative comparisons
   between ALEXI and modeled f(AW) estimates from the Eta Data Assimilation
   System (EDAS) are also performed to assess the possible advantages of
   using ALEXI soil moisture estimates within numerical weather predication
   (NWP) simulations. This TIR retrieval technique is advantageous over
   microwave techniques because of the ability to indirectly sense
   f(AW)-and hence soil moisture conditions extending into the root-zone
   layer. Retrievals are also possible over dense vegetation cover and are
   available on spatial resolutions on the order of the native TIR imagery.
   A notable disadvantage is the inability to retrieve f(AW) conditions
   through cloud cover.},

Abstract = {This study was carried out at the experimental field station of the
   Atomic Energy Authority in Anshas, Egypt, by the aim of assessing the
   soil moisture status under surface and subsurface drip irrigation
   systems, as a function of the variation in the distance between drippers
   along and between laterals. Moisture measurements were carried out using
   neutron moisture meter technique, and water distribution uniformity was
   assessed by applying Surfer Model. The presented data indicated that the
   soil moisture distribution and its uniformity within the soil profile
   under surface drip was to great extent affected by the distance between
   drippers rather than that between laterals. Generally, the soil moisture
   distribution under using 30-cm dripper spacing was better than of that
   under 50 cm. Under subsurface drip irrigation, the allocation of the
   irrigation system was the factor that dominantly affected the moisture
   trend under the studied variables. Installing the system at 30 cm from
   the soil surface is the one to be recommended as it represents the
   active root zone for most vegetable crops, beside it leads to a better
   water saving in sandy soils than that allocated at 15 cm depth.},

Abstract = {Within the `Convective and Orographically-induced Precipitation Study'
   (COPS) 2007 in Southwest Germany and Northeast France a soil moisture
   monitoring network was installed. The aim of the network is to identify
   the interaction between the temporal and spatial variability of the soil
   moisture field and its influence on the energy balance and the moisture
   availability in the planetary boundary layer. The network is comprised
   of a large number of newly developed low-cost soil moisture sensors
   based on the frequency-domain reflectometry method (FDR). In total 47
   soil moisture stations within the COPS domain were each equipped with
   two to four sensors simultaneously measuring vertical profiles of soil
   moisture and soil temperature down to 50 cm depth. This contribution
   describes the soil moisture network, its installation procedure and the
   calibration of the sensor output signal. Furthermore we discuss the soil
   texture distribution within the study area and present first analyses of
   the spatio-temporal soil moisture variability during a 13 month period
   from June 2007 till June 2008 based on regional differences and site
   specific properties (altitude and soil texture). Results show that the
   altitude plays a key role for the overall soil moisture pattern relative
   to the area mean due to the direct linkage to precipitation patterns.
   Soil texture controls the vertical soil moisture gradient relative to
   the near surface soil moisture, as their properties control water
   storage and drainage characteristics. Both factors significantly
   influence regional soil moisture patterns in Southwest Germany.},

Abstract = {Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST) represents a valuable
   source of data for a simple modelling of the dynamic of soil moisture
   (SM) over large areas. In this paper we evaluated the capability of LST
   monthly anomalies, derived from the MOD11C3 standard product, to capture
   the SM dynamic as modelled over Europe by means of an ensemble of three
   land surface models. The direct use of LST as proxy of SM outperformed
   other LST-derived quantities, such as surface-to-air temperature
   gradient and day-night temperature variations, returning significant
   correlation values over the whole domain. LST performed better over
   Southern Europe compared to the Northern part of the domain, with the
   best results over areas characterized by water-limited conditions and
   moderate stress. Additionally, the analysis of the contingency matrix
   shows that the LST model is skillful in capturing extreme dry SM events,
   and it also has a good overall capability to correctly detect the dry
   events in 66\% of the cases, with an average probability of false alarm
   of about 30\%. Overall, the use of LST anomalies seems a promising
   starting point for a reliable modelling of the SM dynamic with a minimum
   amount of information. Even if the adopted approach is simple, the
   results are encouraging for a practical use of LST in an operational
   drought monitoring system over the study area.},

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Understanding the hydrological dynamics of boreal wetland ecosystems
   (peatlands) is essential in order to better manage hydropower
   inter-annual productivity at the La Grande basin (Northern Quebec, QC,
   Canada). Given the remoteness and the huge dimension of the La Grande
   basin, it is imperative to develop remote sensing monitoring techniques
   to retrieve hydrological parameters. The main objective of this study is
   to find out if multi-date and multi-polarization Radar Satellite 2
   (RADARSAT-2) (C-band) image analysis could detect seasonal variations of
   surface soil moisture conditions of the acrotelm. A change detection
   approach through the use of multi temporal indexes was chosen based on
   the assumption that the temporal variability of surface roughness and
   natural vegetation biomass is generally at a much longer time scale than
   that of surface soil moisture (-Index is based on a reference image that
   represents dry soil, in order to maximize the sensitivity of sigma
   degrees to changes in soil moisture with respect to the same location
   when soil is wet). The -Index approach was tested with each
   polarization: sigma degrees for fully polarimetric mode (HH, HV, VV) and
   the cross-polarization coefficient (HV/HH). Results show that the best
   regression adjustment with regard to surface soil moisture content in
   boreal wetlands was obtained with the cross-polarization coefficient.
   The cross-polarization multi-temporal index enables precise volumetric
   surface soil moisture estimation and monitoring on boreal wetlands,
   regardless of the influence of vegetation cover and surface roughness
   conditions (bias was under 1\%, standard deviation and RMSE were under
   10\% for almost all estimation errors). Surface soil moisture estimation
   was more precise over permanently flooded areas than seasonally flooded
   ones (standard deviation is systematically greater for the seasonally
   flooded areas, at all analyzed scales), although the overall quality of
   the estimation is still precise. Cross-polarization ratio image analysis
   appears to be a useful mean to exploit radar data spatially, as we were
   able to relate changes in wetland eco-hydrological dynamics to
   variations in the intensity of the ratio.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture controls the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and
   infiltration and, consequently, the runoff generation. On the catchment
   scale its routine monitoring can be performed through remote sensing
   technologies. Within this framework, the purpose of this study is to
   investigate the potential of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit
   (AMSU), radiometer on board the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration) satellites and operating since 1998, for the assessment
   of soil wetness conditions by comparing soil moisture data with both
   those measured in situ and provided by a continuous rainfall-runoff
   model applied to four catchments located in the Upper Tiber River
   (Central Italy). In particular, in order to perform a robust analysis an
   extensive and long-term period (nine years) of data was investigated. In
   detail, the Soil Wetness Variation Index, derived from the AMSU data
   modified in order to take account of the difference between the soil
   layer investigated by the satellite sensor and that used as a benchmark,
   was found to be correlated both with the in-situ and modeled soil
   moisture variations showing correlation coefficients in the range of
   0.42-0.49 and 0.33-0.48, respectively. As far as the soil moisture
   temporal pattern is concerned, higher correlations were obtained
   (0.59-0.84 for the in-situ data and 0.82-0.87 for the modeled data set)
   partly due to the soil moisture seasonal pattem that enhances the
   correlation. Overall, the root mean square error was found to be less
   than 0.05 m(3)/m(3) for both the comparisons, thus assessing the
   potential of the AMSU sensor to quantitatively retrieve soil moisture
   temporal patterns. Moreover. the AMSU sensor can be considered as a
   useful tool to provide a reliable and frequently updated global soil
   moisture data set, considering its higher temporal resolution now
   available (about 4 passes per day) thanks to the presence of the sensor
   aboard different satellites. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The swidden agroforestry system of the Lacandon Maya has allowed them to
   sustainably manage their land for hundreds of years without observed
   soil degradation. Lacandon land managers plant and care for many
   particular tree species during the fallow period of their
   multi-successional swidden system to facilitate the restoration of soil
   fertility. Soil samples were taken around six of tree species (Poulsenia
   armata, Cedrela odorata, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Swietenia
   macrophylla, Lonchocarpus guatemalensis, and Heliocarpus appendiculatus)
   in different-aged sites to evaluate their effect on soil fertility. Soil
   nutrient levels increased in the later successional stages of the
   Lacandon agroforestry system. Available phosphorus was elevated in soils
   beneath P. armata, C. odorata, and L. guatemalensis trees, and decreased
   with distance away from the trunk. L. guatemalensis presented similar
   effects with total nitrogen and soil organic matter content. These
   results demonstrate that Lacandon Maya agroforestry management choices
   relate positively to soil restoration. This TEK could lend guidance to
   countering the ecological degradation of the surrounding Montes Azules
   Biosphere Reserve region and for other humid Neotropical lowland

Abstract = {Issues of food security, environmental degradation and global climate
   change underscore the need for the improved understanding of sustainable
   agricultural systems around the globe. The Quesungual slash-and-mulch
   agroforestry system (QSMAS) of western Honduras offers a promising
   alternative to traditional slash-and-burn (SB) agriculture for the
   mountainous tropical dry forest zones of Central America, but the
   overall influence of this system on soils is not fully understood. We
   examined earthworm populations, soil fertility and soil organic matter
   (SOM) dynamics under QSMAS and SB agriculture, with secondary forest
   (SF) as a reference. Both QSMAS and SB consisted of treatments with and
   without inorganic fertilizer (N-P-K) additions, resulting in five
   management treatments, each present on three replicate farms. Baseline
   soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected prior to forest clearing and
   establishment of QSMAS plots in 2003 and in SB and SF plots in 2005 to
   determine initial soil concentrations of C and N. Soils were sampled in
   2006 and 2007 for bulk soil C and N and P availability, as well as for
   aggregate fractionation and determination of C and N within the
   different aggregate size fractions. Earthworm populations were assessed
   in July 2007. Earthworm numbers and biomass were higher under QSMAS than
   under SB (13.4 vs. 0.8 g fresh biomass m(-2) : respectively).
   Significant interactions between cropping system and fertilization
   suggest that QSMAS increased the availability of added inorganic P, 3
   times more under QSMAS than for SB. Comparisons with SF, indicated that
   both cropping systems resulted in a dramatic loss of C (average 5gC
   kg(-1) soil) since treatment implementation, and that this loss was
   mainly associated with the disruption of C rich large macroaggregates
   (>2000 mu m). After taking into account baseline soil C differences
   between plots, no major differences in total SOM losses Were found
   between QSMAS and SB management. However, earlier establishment of QSMAS
   plots suggests that the overall rate of C loss since treatment
   establishment was lower for QSMAS than for SB. Results from this study
   suggest that the Quesungual agroforestry system offers great potential
   to improve soil fertility and biological health in the region relative
   to traditional slash-and-burn agriculture. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Useful Drainage Estimates Obtained from a Large-Scale Soil Moisture
   Monitoring Network by Applying the Unit-Gradient Assumption},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {6},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Groundwater supplies similar to 20\% of global freshwater withdrawals,
   and accurate information regarding groundwater recharge rates is needed
   for sustainable groundwater management. Recharge rates are often limited
   by the rates of drainage from the soil profile, which are influenced by
   soil moisture conditions. Soil moisture monitoring has expanded
   dramatically in recent decades with the advent of large-scale networks
   like the Oklahoma Mesonet, which has monitored soil moisture statewide
   since 1996. Using those data with site-specific soil hydraulic
   properties and a unit-gradient assumption, we estimated daily drainage
   rates at 60 cm for 78 sites for up to 17 yr. Our working hypothesis was
   that these drainage rates are indicative of potential groundwater
   recharge rates. Mean annual drainage rates ranged from 6 to 266 mm
   yr(-1), with a statewide median of 67 mm yr(-1). These rates agreed well
   with prior recharge estimates for major Oklahoma aquifers. To provide a
   further independent check on our results, drainage was modeled using
   HYDRUS-1D for four focus sites across 17 yr. Soil-moisture-based
   drainage rates and HYDRUS-1D drainage rates agreed to within 10 mm
   yr-(1) at the drier two sites but had discrepancies of > 150 mm yr(-1)
   at two sites with > 1000 mm yr(-1) precipitation. Simulations also
   showed that for a semiarid site the unit-gradient assumption was likely
   violated at the 60-cm depth, highlighting the need for deeper soil
   moisture monitoring. Despite these limitations, this simple method for
   estimating drainage through long-term soil moisture monitoring shows
   unique potential to provide valuable information for hydrology and
   groundwater management.},

   planting rice. Rice plants were either fertilized or not using a

   respectively. The results showed that the application of legume green
   manures and fertilizer, either singly or in combination, improved soil
   nutrient availability, CEC, shoot yield, and grain yield of rice on both
   biochar-amended and unamended plots. However, the effect was
   significantly (p<0.05) greater on biochar-amended plots. The mean grain
   yield for all cropping seasons was 1.8tha(-1) for biochar-amended plots

   biochar-amended plots was associated with improved soil fertility and

Abstract = {The partitioning of crop canopy water may affect soil water distribution
   and this may in turn affect sprinkler irrigation application efficiency.
   The aim of this work was to develop a methodology to evaluate spatial
   and temporal soil water content distribution in the case of sprinkler
   irrigation application efficiency considering stemflow. Time domain
   reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture monitoring was carried out on eight
   soil water sensor locations for both center pivot and traveling big gun
   irrigation in different phenological and tillage cases. The two case
   studies were chosen because they show the two opposite limits of the
   methodology's application. Two water distribution estimation methods
   were employed: raw measured soil moisture and model simulation of the
   infiltration process. The infiltration process was modeled by means of
   the two-dimensional (2D) Richard's equation. The simulations were
   calibrated on the data measured at eight soil water sensor locations.
   The stemflow and surface runoff conveyed in the interrow by hilling were
   obtained as additional model-fitting parameters. During center pivot
   irrigation, 34\% of the water delivered in the interrow was conveyed in

   delivered in the row was conveyed in the interrow. Soil water
   distributions calculated from measured data overestimated irrigation
   application efficiency by approximately 15\%. The spatial and temporal
   soil water content distribution obtained from simulation of the water
   infiltration process allowed mass balance closure in both case studies.
   The proposed simulation method evaluated stemflow effects on the water
   distribution profile, leading to accurate application efficiency

Abstract = {Drought is one of the major natural hazards that bring about billions of
   dollars in loss to the farming community around the world each year.
   Drought is most often caused by a departure of precipitation from the
   normal amount, and agriculture is often the first sector to be affected
   by the onset of drought due to its dependence on water resources and
   soil moisture reserves during various stages of crop growth. Currently
   used drought indices like the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and
   Standardized 2 Precipitation Index (SPI) have coarse spatial
   (7000-100,000 km(2)) and temporal resolution (monthly). Hence, the
   distributed hydrologic model SWAT was used to simulate soil moisture and
   evapotranspiration from daily weather data at a high spatial resolution
   (16 km(2)) using GIS. Using this simulated data the drought indices Soil
   Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) and Evapotranspiration Deficit Index
   (ETDI) were developed based on weekly soil moisture deficit and
   evapotranspiration deficit, respectively. SMDI was computed at four
   different levels, using soil water available in the entire soil profile,
   then soil water available at the top 2 ft. (SMDI-2), 4 ft. (SMDI-4), and
   6 ft. (SMDI-6). This was done because the potential of the crop to
   extract water from depths varies during different stages of the crop
   growth and also by crop type. ETDI and SMDI-2 had less autocorrelation
   lag, indicating that they could be used as good indicators of short-term
   drought. The developed drought indices showed high spatial variability
   (spatial standard deviation similar to 1.00) in the study watersheds,
   primarily due to high spatial variability of precipitation. The wheat
   and sorghum crop yields were highly correlated (r > 0.75) with the ETDI
   and SMDI's during the weeks of critical crop growth stages, indicating
   that the developed drought indices can be used for monitoring
   agricultural drought. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Assessing the utility of meteorological drought indices in monitoring
   summer drought based on soil moisture in Chongqing, China},

Abstract = {Numerous drought indices have been developed to analyze and monitor
   drought condition, but they are region specific and limited by various
   climatic conditions. In southwest China, summer drought mainly occurs
   from June to September, causing destructive and profound impact on
   agriculture, society, and ecosystems. The current study assesses the
   availability of meteorological drought indices in monitoring summer
   drought in this area at 5-day scale. The drought indices include the
   relative moisture index (M), the standardized precipitation index (SPI),
   the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the
   composite index of meteorological drought (CIspi), and the improved
   composite index of meteorological drought (CIwap). Long-term daily
   precipitation and temperature from 1970 to 2014 are used to calculate
   30-day M (M (30)), SPI (SPI30), SPEI (SPEI30), 90-day SPEI (SPEI90),
   CIspi, and CIwap. The 5-day soil moisture observations from 2010 to 2013
   are applied to assess the performance of these drought indices.
   Correlation analysis, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient are
   utilized to investigate the relationships between soil moisture and
   drought indices. Correlation analysis indicates that soil moisture is
   well correlated with CIwap, SPEI30, M (30), SPI30, and CIspi except
   SPEI90. Moreover, drought classifications identified by M (30) are in
   agreement with that of the observed soil moisture. The results show that
   M (30) based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is an
   appropriate indicator for monitoring drought condition at a finer scale
   in the study area. According to M (30), summer drought during 1970-2014
   happened in each year and showed a slightly upward tendency in recent
   years.},

Abstract = {The initialization and potential predictability of soil moisture in
   CanCM4 hindcasts during 1981-2010 is assessed. CanCM4 is one of the two
   global climate models employed by the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual
   Prediction System (CanSIPS) providing operational multiseasonal
   forecasts for Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Soil
   moisture forecast initialization in CanSIPS is determined by the
   response of the land component to forcing from data-constrained model
   atmospheric fields. We evaluate hindcast initial conditions for soil
   moisture and its atmospheric forcings against observation-based
   datasets. Although model values of soil moisture variability compare
   relatively well with a blend of two reanalysis products, there is
   significant disagreement in the tropics and arid regions linked to
   biases in precipitation, as well as in snow-covered regions, likely the
   result of biases in the timing of snow onset and melt. The temporal
   variance of initial soil moisture anomalies is typically larger in
   regions of considerable precipitation variability and in cold
   continental areas of shallow soil depth. Appreciable variance of initial
   conditions, combined with persistence of the initial anomalies and the
   model's ability to represent future climate variations, lead to
   potentially predictable soil moisture variance exceeding 60\% of the
   total variance for up to 3-4 months in the tropics and 6-7 months in the
   mid- to high latitudes during hemispheric winter. Potential
   predictability at longer leads is primarily found in the tropics and
   extratropical areas of ENSO-teleconnected influences. We use lagged
   partial correlations to show that ENSO-teleconnected precipitation in
   CanCM4 is a likely source of potential predictability of soil moisture
   up to 1-yr lead in CanSIPS hindcasts.},

Title = {Partitioning Evapotranspiration Using an Eddy Covariance-Based
   Technique: Improved Assessment of Soil Moisture and Land-Atmosphere
   Exchange Dynamics},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The capability to partition evapotranspiration (ET) measurements into
   two components, namely direct evaporation (E) from soil, leaf, and
   litter surfaces and transpiration (T) via plants is critical toward
   better defining hydrological processes along the soil-plant-atmosphere
   continuum. Such information has practical applications ranging from
   water resource management to climate modeling. A recently developed
   partitioning technique was employed using high frequency measurements of
   water vapor and carbon dioxide collected by an eddy covariance flux
   system, which was deployed over a corn (Zea mays L.) field near
   Beltsville, MD for a full growing season. The partitioning technique is
   based on flux-variance similarity theory and has the benefit of relying
   on routinely collected eddy covariance measurements, with no additional
   instrumentation required. Results showed an increase in the T/ET ratio
   from similar to 5\% during the early portion of the growing season to
   similar to 70-80\% by the time the corn crop reached maturity. This was
   consistent with observed dynamics of the soil moisture profile, which
   indicated that water was removed from deeper soil layers as the growing
   season progressed. The partitioned estimates of T are shown to be useful
   for the appropriate calculation of canopy conductance, a key variable in
   land surface models. Finally, the transient impact of rainfall events
   were examined, in which the suppression of T and enhancement of E were
   observed for up to several days following rainfall. Insight gained
   through the partitioning of ET fluxes has the potential to significantly
   improve the structure and parameterization of land surface hydrological
   models.},

   Geosynchronous SAR Mission for Soil Moisture Monitoring},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {10},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The next generation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) systems could
   foresee satellite missions based on a geosynchronous orbit (GEO SAR).
   These systems are able to provide radar images with an unprecedented
   combination of spatial (1 km) and temporal (12 h) resolutions. This
   paper investigates the GEO SAR potentialities for soil moisture (SM)
   mapping finalized to hydrological applications, and defines the best
   compromise, in terms of image spatio-temporal resolution, for SM
   monitoring. A synthetic soil moisture-data assimilation (SM-DA)
   experiment was thus set up to evaluate the impact of the hydrological
   assimilation of different GEO SAR-like SM products, characterized by
   diverse spatio-temporal resolutions. The experiment was also designed to
   understand if GEO SAR-like SM maps could provide an added value with
   respect to SM products retrieved from SAR images acquired from
   satellites flying on a quasi-polar orbit, like Sentinel-1 (POLAR SAR).
   Findings showed that GEO SAR systems provide a valuable contribution for
   hydrological applications, especially if the possibility to generate
   many sub-daily observations is sacrificed in favor of higher spatial
   resolution. In the experiment, it was found that the assimilation of two
   GEO SAR-like observations a day, with a spatial resolution of 100 m,
   maximized the performances of the hydrological predictions, for both
   streamflow and SM state forecasts. Such improvements of the model
   performances were found to be 45\% higher than the ones obtained by
   assimilating POLAR SAR-like SM maps.},

Abstract = {Quantification of organic N mineralization during the corn (Zea mays L.)
   growing season should improve the precision of fertilizer N
   recommendations. The Illinois soil N test (ISNT) has shown promise in
   some regions as a useful tool for estimating mineralizable soil N;
   however, the procedure needs to be modified for use in routine soil
   testing labs that must process hundreds of samples per day. The assay
   determines alkali hydrolyzable N by treating 1 g of soil with 10 mL of 2
   mol L-1 NaOH in a 473-mL wide-mouth Ball jar, and heating for 5 h at 50
   degrees C on a hot plate to liberate (NH4+ amino sugar)-N as gaseous
   NH3, which is collected in H3BO3 solution and subsequently determined by
   acidimetric titration. The objectives of this study were to determine if
   variance in measurement values could be reduced and sample throughput
   increased while maintaining accuracy by using an incubator to replace
   the hot plate as the heat source. Thirty-five soils collected from
   N-response trials in Virginia were used in this study. Jars were heated
   in an incubator at 50 degrees C for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 15 h. Soil
   samples were also analyzed with the unmodified method for comparison.
   All determinations were conducted in triplicate. Use of an incubator set
   to 50 degrees C reduced the total recovery of N from the samples, but
   increasing the diffusion period increased N recovery. The 15-h diffusion
   period resulted in quantitative recovery of ISNT-N with significantly (P
   < 0.05) improved measurement precision compared with the unmodified
   method (CV = 4.3 vs. 7.4, respectively). Modifying the ISNT by using an
   incubator instead of a hot plate increases measurement precision and
   allows greater sample throughput.},

Abstract = {Soil-test P (SIP) and crop P needs vary within fields and variable-rate

   were 18.3 m and 605 to 660 m, respectively. Initial soil samples were
   taken from 0.3-ha cells and post-harvest samples were taken each year by
   treatment (0.1-ha cells). High N (for corn) and K rates were applied
   uniformly across all strips. Manure P increased strip-average grain
   yield (P <= 0.05) in eight of nine site-years but yield for FR and VR
   did not differ. The study of yield responses for field areas with
   different SIP showed that manure P always increased yield with SIP very
   low or low (<16 mg Bray-P-1 kg(-1)) and only in three site-years with
   STP optimum (16-20 mg P kg(-1)). Yield responses differed between FR and
   VR in very low areas of one site-year, where VR increased corn yield
   more than FR. The VR method reduced within-field SIP variability
   compared with FR with the exception of only one site-year. Although VR
   did not increase yield compared with FR, less manure P was applied to
   high-testing areas and it reduced SIP variability.},

Abstract = {A reliable and practical test that can provide timely measurements of

   improving the accuracy of N fertilizer applications for grassland and

   estimate of MN, once soils are grouped according to soil characteristics
   such as the drainage type and sampling depth. To date, development and
   evaluation of the ISNT method has been conducted using arable soils
   mainly in North America where, in general, soils have lower levels of
   soil organic matter (SOM) compared to temperate grassland soils. We
   evaluated the effects of two pre-treatment soil aggregate sizes of <1mm
   and <2mm on the yield and recovery of MN (1) across temperate grassland
   soil types, and (2) across a 6-h interval diffusion period. No
   significant difference existed in the concentrations of ISNT-N between
   the two soil aggregate sizes of each soil type. For both aggregate
   sample sizes, the recovery of spiked amino sugar-N glucosamine from a
   temperate grassland soil was generally linear until hour 5, after which
   the quantities of recovered N diminished. Although N recovery after 6h
   of diffusion at 50 degrees C (+/- 1 degrees C) was less than 100\% in
   both aggregate size samples, the response models indicated that the
   standard ISNT protocol using a 5-h diffusion period is appropriate for
   temperate grassland soils. The incomplete recovery of N in these mineral
   soils suggested that the protocol could be further optimized for
   temperate soils with high organic matter content and additional
   evaluation of the temperature during diffusion within an enclosed
   environment may be required using N (spiked glucosamine-N) recovery

   Community Climate System Model (CCSM-WRF) to investigate the role of
   soil moisture feedbacks in summer surface air temperature variability
   over East Asia for the period of 1976-2005. Strong soil moisture
   feedbacks on the daily mean and maximum temperatures identified by the
   CCSM-WRF model system mainly appear over the region from southern
   Siberia through eastern Mongolia to northeast China, the Tibetan
   Plateau, and most areas of central and east China, accounting for
   30\%-70\% of the total variances. Meanwhile, the simulated soil moisture
   feedbacks on daily minimum temperature are shown to be much weaker than
   those on daily mean and maximum temperatures. The soil
   moisture-temperature feedbacks in the CCSM-WRF model system are
   generally well validated with those from two reanalysis products. The
   analysis of the physical processes shows that soil moisture feedback
   strength is mainly determined by the ability of soil moisture to
   influence the local surface heat fluxes and planetary boundary layer
   processes. The reasonable simulations of present soil
   moisture-temperature feedbacks indicate that the CCSM-WRF model system
   can be further applied to understand the role of soil moisture in

Abstract = {Clouds often limit the ability of optical satellite sensors (such as the
   newly launched Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite in China) to observe regional
   soilmoisture at high spatial resolutions, especially under
   full-cloud-contamination condition. Thus, accurate reconstruction of
   regional soil moisture in this case became a great methodological
   challenge because of the complexity and ill-posed nature of the problem.
   In this paper, we present a Satellite and In situ sensor Collaborated
   Reconstruction (SICR) method. In this method, four reconstruction rules
   were proposed to rebuild four kinds of corresponding missing pixels,
   defined as follows: C1 pixel (including one in situ sensor in its area),
   C2 pixel (physically similar to C1), C3 pixel (with a regular soil
   moisture observation sequence), and C4 pixel (remaining). By analyzing
   soil moisture observation relationships between these four types of
   pixels with in situ measurements and within these pixels, four numerical
   reconstruction rules were established. Linear regression, similar pixel
   determination, least square method, and geostatistical interpolation
   algorithms were used in these four rules. At last, all blank soil
   moisture pixels in the target soil moisture image can be filled by the
   SICR method. The experiment conducted in the central south of U.S.
   integrated 11 in situ soil moisture sensors from the United States
   Department of Agriculturewith 11 GF-1 satellite soil moisture images. It
   was demonstrated that GF-1 soil moisture observations on October 17,
   2014, were successfully reconstructed by the SICR method, based on the
   evaluations of visual appearance comparison, error distribution
   analysis, subimage comparison, average relative error, and universal
   image quality index. SICR also performed better than the reconstruction
   results only based on in situ or satellite sensor data. Moreover, the
   comparison with the soil moisture observation from the microwave sensor
   demonstrated the value of SICR in regional high-resolution soil moisture
   reconstruction. It was suggested that the SICR method provided an
   effective reconstruction method under full cloud contamination and
   showed great potential for collaborating satellite and in situ sensors.},

   MIR provided good calibrations for organic carbon, total N, and soil
   texture. To varying degrees of precision, these regions also calibrated
   for pH and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K. Exchangeable P did not form
   useful calibrations in either spectral region. In all cases, MIR
   calibrations were better than those formed in the NIR region. Test of
   calibrations based on one-third of the samples was used to predict the
   remaining samples. This demonstrated the strategy of developing
   field-scale calibrations for the spectral regions by chemical analysis
   of a small sub-set of samples for the prediction of large numbers of
   samples. This approach can be used to accurately map the spatial
   distribution of soil properties within agricultural landscapes. These
   studies demonstrate the utility of infrared spectral approaches for
   generating the spatial soil properties data needed to implement
   precision agriculture technology.},

Title = {A method for estimating maximum static rainfall retention in pebble
   mulches used for soil moisture conservation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {537},
Pages = {346-355},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Mulching of agricultural fields and gardens with pebbles has long been
   practiced to conserve soil moisture in some semi-arid regions with low
   precipitation. Rainfall interception by the pebble mulch itself is an
   important part of the computation of the water balance for the pebble
   mulched fields and gardens. The mean equivalent diameter (MED) was used
   to characterize the pebble size. The maximum static rainfall retention
   in pebble mulch is based on the water penetrating into the pores of
   pebbles, the water adhering to the outside surfaces of pebbles and the
   water held between pebbles of the mulch. Equations describing the water
   penetrating into the pores of pebbles and the water adhering to the
   outside surface of pebbles are constructed based on the physical
   properties of water and the pebble characteristics. The model for the
   water between pebbles of the mulch is based on the basic equation to
   calculate the water bridge volume and the basic coordination number
   model. A method to calculate the maximum static rainfall retention in
   the pebble mulch is presented. Laboratory rain simulation experiments
   were performed to test the model with measured data. Paired sample
   t-tests showed no significant differences between the values calculated
   with the method and the measured data. The model is ready for testing on
   field mulches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The SMEX02 experiments held in June-July 2002, at Iowa demonstrated the
   potential of the L band radiometer (PALS) in estimation of near surface
   soil moisture under dense vegetation canopy conditions. The L band radar
   was also shown to be sensitive to near surface soil moisture. However,
   the spatial resolution of a typical satellite L band radiometer is of
   the order of tens of kilometers, which is not sufficient to serve the
   full range of science needs for land surface hydrology and weather
   modeling applications. Disaggregation schemes for deriving sub pixel
   estimates of soil moisture from radiometer data using higher resolution
   radar observations may provide the means for making available global
   soil moisture observations at much finer scale. This paper presents a
   simple approach for disaggregation of coarser resolution radiometer
   estimates of soil moisture using higher resolution radar backscatter and
   vegetation water content measurements. The algorithm has been applied to
   coincident PALS radiometer and Airsar datasets of 400m and 30m spatial
   resolutions respectively acquired during the SMEX02 campaign. PALS
   radiometer estimates of soil moisture at a 400m resolution have been

Abstract = {In recent years, different space agencies have launched satellite
   missions that carry passive microwave instruments on-board that can
   measure surface soil moisture. Three currently operational missions are
   the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission developed by the
   European Space Agency (ESA), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
   2 (AMSR2) developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA),
   and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) from China's National
   Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC). In this study, the quality of
   surface soil moisture anomalies derived from these passive microwave
   instruments was sequentially assessed over the mainland of the People's
   Republic of China. First, the impact of a recent update in the Land
   Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was assessed for MWRI observations.
   Then, the soil moisture measurements retrieved from the X-band
   observations of MWRI were compared with those of AMSR2, followed by an
   internal comparison of the multiple frequencies of AMSR2. Finally, SMOS
   retrievals from two different algorithms were also included in the
   comparison. For each sequential step, processing and verification chains
   were specifically designed to isolate the impact of algorithm (version),
   observation frequency or instrument characteristics. Two verification
   techniques are used: the statistical Triple Collocation technique is
   used as the primary verification tool, while the precipitation-based
   Rvalue technique is used to confirm key results. Our results indicate a
   consistently better performance throughout the entire study area after
   the implementation of an update of the LPRM. We also find that passive
   microwave observations in the AMSR2 C-band frequency (6.9 GHz) have an
   advantage over the AMSR2 X-band frequency (10.7 GHz) over moderate to
   densely vegetated regions. This finding is in line with theoretical
   expectations as emitted soil radiation will become masked under a dense
   canopy with stricter thresholds for higher passive microwave
   frequencies. Both AMSR2 and MWRI make X-band observations; a direct
   comparison between them reveals a consistently higher quality obtained
   by AMSR2, specifically over semi-arid climate regimes. Unfortunately,
   Radio Frequency Interference hampers the usefulness of soil moisture
   products for the SMOS L-band mission, leading to a significantly reduced
   revisit time over the densely populated eastern part of the country.
   Nevertheless, our analysis demonstrates that soil moisture products from
   a number of multi-frequency microwave sensors are credible alternatives
   for this dedicated L-band mission over the mainland of the People's
   Republic of China.},

Abstract = {While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) become more popular as a tool for
   scientists and engineers in environmental monitoring, the energy
   efficiency of WSN's primary unit, the mote, is increasingly critical.
   Motes perform communication and processing functions and also take
   measurements using limited onboard battery power. For environmental
   monitoring deployment, sampling rates need to be assigned to motes such
   that useful information can be extracted over both spatial and temporal
   scales. The data sampling rate, which is intimately related to data
   transmission rate, plays an important role in the mote's battery life.
   Moreover, while it has been noted that mote operation continues under
   less than optimal power supply levels, data collected during this time
   undergoes attenuation from the desired measurement. That is, low battery
   conditions of motes could significantly affect the accuracy of sensed
   data. This paper investigates the above two issues to achieve extended
   battery life for individual wireless motes while maintaining sampling
   adequacy and reliability in transmitting accurate data. We first study
   how different sensor characteristics, such as different types of sap
   flow sensors, can affect motes' sampling and transmission rate. Then, we
   examine the effect of sensing attenuation due to low battery power on
   sap flow, soil moisture, and soil water potential measurements. A simple
   regression model was found to correct data for both the sap flow and
   soil water potential sensors sampled on under-powered motes. By
   operating under less than optimal power levels, this effectively
   increases motes' battery life for reliable data collection from wireless
   sensor networks.},

Volume = {46},

Abstract = {Irrigation control systems that irrigate container-grown plants based on
   crop water needs can reduce water and fertilizer use and increase the
   sustainability of ornamental crop production. The use of soil moisture
   sensors to determine when to irrigate is a viable option. We tested a
   commercially available irrigation controller (CS3500; Acclima, Meridian,
   ID), which uses time domain transmissometry (TDT) sensors to measure
   soil volumetric water content (theta). The objectives of this study
   were: 1) to test the accuracy of TDT sensors in soilless substrate; 2)
   to quantify the ability of the Acclima CS3500 irrigation controller to
   maintain stable theta readings during the production of container-grown
   begonia (Begonia semperflorens L.) by turning a drip irrigation system
   on and off as needed; and 3) to study the growth and photosynthetic
   physiology of begonia at six theta levels. Calibration of the TDT
   sensors in pots filled with substrate (but without plants) showed that
   the theta determined by the TDT sensors had a very close relationship
   (R-2 = 0.99) with the gravimetrically determined theta, but the TDT
   sensors underestimated theta by approximate to 0.08 m(3).m(-3).
   Therefore, a custom calibration of the TDT sensors for the soilless
   substrate was necessary to get accurate theta data. The irrigation
   controller was programmed to maintain six theta thresholds, ranging from
   0.136 to 0.472 m(3).m(-3) (based on our own sensor calibration), and was
   able to maintain theta readings within 0.008 m(3).m(-3) of the
   threshold. Theta and Sigma probes were used to collect comparative theta
   and bulk electrical conductivity (EC) data, respectively. The results
   showed a strong correlation with TDT sensor measurements of theta (R-2 =
   0.92) but a moderate relationship for bulk EC (le = 0.53). The begonias
   had similar dry weight at theta levels of theta.348 m(3).m(-3) and
   higher, whereas total evapotranspiration increased linearly with the
   theta threshold. The lowest theta threshold reduced leaf size, net
   photosynthesis (P-n), and stomatal conductance (gs). Overall, the TDT
   sensors can provide accurate measurements of theta in soilless substrate
   but need substrate-specific calibration. The Acclima CS3500 controller,
   using TDT sensors, was able to maintain stable theta readings throughout
   a production cycle. These results suggest that this irrigation
   controller may be suitable for production of greenhouse crops as well as
   in drought stress research.},

Abstract = {High spatial resolution airborne data with little sub-pixel
   heterogeneity were used to evaluate the suitability of the
   temperature/vegetation (Ts/VI) space method developed from satellite
   observations, and were explored to improve the performance of the Ts/VI
   space method for estimating soil moisture (SM). An evaluation of the
   airborne Delta T-s/Fr space (incorporated with air temperature) revealed
   that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) saturation and
   disturbed pixels were hindering the appropriate construction of the
   space. The non-disturbed Delta T-s/Fr space, which was modified by
   adjusting the NDVI saturation and eliminating the disturbed pixels, was
   clearly correlated with the measured SM. The SM estimations of the
   non-disturbed Delta T-s/Fr space using the evaporative fraction (EF) and
   temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) were validated by using the
   SM measured at a depth of 4 cm, which was determined according to the
   land surface types. The validation results show that the EF approach
   provides superior estimates with a lower RMSE (0.023 m(3)center dot
   m(-3)) value and a higher correlation coefficient (0.68) than the TVDI.
   The application of the airborne Delta T-s/Fr space shows that the two
   modifications proposed in this study strengthen the link between the
   Delta T-s/Fr space and SM, which is important for improving the
   precision of the remote sensing Ts/VI space method for monitoring SM.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING},

Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Pages = {931-938},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Soil particle size distribution (PSD) (i.e., clay, silt, sand, and rock
   contents) information is one of critical factors for understanding water
   cycle since it affects almost all of water cycle processes, e. g.,
   drainage, runoff, soil moisture, evaporation, and evapotranspiration.
   With information about soil PSD, we can estimate almost all soil
   hydraulic properties (e.g., saturated soil moisture, field capacity,
   wilting point, residual soil moisture, saturated hydraulic conductivity,
   pore-size distribution index, and bubbling capillary pressure) based on
   published empirical relationships. Therefore, a regional or global soil
   PSD database is essential for studying water cycle regionally or
   globally. At the present stage, three soil geographic databases are
   commonly used, i.e., the Soil Survey Geographic database, the State Soil
   Geographic database, and the National Soil Geographic database. Those
   soil data are map unit based and associated with great uncertainty.
   Ground soil surveys are a way to reduce this uncertainty. However,
   ground surveys are time consuming and labor intensive. In this study, an
   inverse method for estimating mean and standard deviation of soil PSD
   from observed soil moisture is proposed and applied to Throughfall
   Displacement Experiment sites in Walker Branch Watershed in eastern
   Tennessee. This method is based on the relationship between spatial mean
   and standard deviation of soil moisture. The results indicate that the
   suggested method is feasible and has potential for retrieving soil PSD
   information globally from remotely sensed soil moisture data.},

   aircraft and satellite image data and then show how the triangle can be
   created from a land surface model. By superimposing the model triangle
   over the observed one, pixel values from the image are determined for
   all points within the triangle. We further show how the stretched (or
   `universal') triangle can be used to interpret pixel configurations
   within the triangle, showing how the temporal trajectories of points
   uniquely describe patterns of land use change. Finally, we conclude the
   paper with a brief assessment of the method's limitations.},

Volume = {136},
Pages = {28-36},

Abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated the possibility to use surface soil
   moisture satellite products in order to correct precipitation estimates.
   The overall approaches are generally based on adjusting the
   precipitation rate into a water balance model in order to match observed
   and simulated soil moisture. In the present study, a recently proposed
   approach was improved and assessed over a 4-year period in West Africa.
   Three different satellite precipitation products (CMORPH, TRMM-3B42 and
   PERSIANN) were used in this study. The new algorithm was evaluated over
   three 0.25 x 0.25 degrees areas in Niger, Mali and Benin and
   precipitation estimates (before and after correction) were compared to
   observed ground-based precipitation measurements. An assessment was also
   conducted at the regional scale using 48 independent rainfall stations
   located in Togo, Niger and Burkina Faso. The proposed methodology showed
   that, after correction, the three satellite precipitation products
   converge to the ground-based precipitation measurements, demonstrating
   the robustness of the methodology. In addition, soil moisture estimates
   derived from the methodology were found to be in good agreement with
   ground-based soil moisture measurements (R-2 > 0.78 in Niger, R-2 > 0.54
   in Mali and R-2 > 0.64 in Benin). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {The immediate cost of shallow regolith landslides in New Zealand has
   been estimated to exceed US\$33M annually. Since the majority of these
   landslides occur during prolonged wet conditions, or intense rainstorms,
   moisture conditions are a critical control. The nature, dynamics, and
   character of soil moisture conditions, and the piezometric response to
   rainfall, have been recorded within an `incipient' landslide for more
   than 5 years. The study site, on pastoral hill country within the Lake
   Tutira catchment in northern Hawkes Bay, is typical of large areas of
   New Zealand episodically affected by extensive landsliding. Detailed
   continuous measurements show that both the soil moisture and piezometric
   response within the regolith are highly storm- and site-specific. The
   development of positive pore pressures is infrequent: they form only
   during intense rainstorms, and persist for a short time. The hydraulic
   response of the soil is primarily a function of storm characteristics,
   but this response can be modified by antecedent moisture conditions,
   topographic position, and heterogeneity of soil properties.
   Stability analysis shows that most slopes in the study area are
   significantly steeper than can be explained by the frictional strength
   of the regolith. Measured hydraulic conditions also show that positive
   pore-water pressures alone do not trigger slope instability. A recent
   slope failure followed a period of extremely high antecedent moisture
   conditions, and occurred when maximum soil moisture conditions, though
   not pore-water pressures, were recorded. Increased moisture content of
   the regolith reduces matric tension, and therefore effective cohesion of
   the soil. This cohesion is critical to maintaining stability of the
   regolith on these slopes. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture mapping at a regional scale is commonplace since these
   data are required in many applications, such as hydrological and
   agricultural analyses. The use of remotely sensed data for the
   estimation of deep soil moisture at a regional scale has received far
   less emphasis. The objective of this study was to map the 500-m, 8-day
   average and daily soil moisture at different soil depths in Oklahoma
   from remotely sensed and ground-measured data using the random forest
   (RF) method, which is one of the machine-learning approaches. In order
   to investigate the estimation accuracy of the RF method at both a
   spatial and a temporal scale, two independent soil moisture estimation
   experiments were conducted using data from 2010 to 2014: a year-to-year
   experiment (with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.038 to
   0.050 m(3)/m(3)) and a station-to-station experiment (with an RMSE
   ranging from 0.044 to 0.057 m(3)/m(3)). Then, the data requirements,
   importance factors, and spatial and temporal variations in estimation
   accuracy were discussed based on the results using the training data
   selected by iterated random sampling. The highly accurate estimations of
   both the surface and the deep soil moisture for the study area reveal
   the potential of RF methods when mapping soil moisture at a regional
   scale, especially when considering the high heterogeneity of land-cover
   types and topography in the study area.},

   observations acquired from the AmeriFlux network within the contiguous
   United States. Through the intercomparison of MI results from different
   SM-EF pairs, the general value (for latent heat flux estimation) of
   superficial soil moisture observations theta(S), vertically integrated
   soil moisture observations theta(V), and vertically extrapolated soil
   moisture time series {[}soil wetness index (SWI) from a simple low-pass
   transformation of theta(S)] are examined. Results suggest that, contrary
   to expectations, 2-day averages of theta(S) and theta(V) have comparable
   mutual information with regards to EF. That is, there is no clear
   evidence that the information content for flux estimation is enhanced
   via deepening the vertical support of superficial soil moisture
   observations. In addition, the utility of SWI in monitoring and
   forecasting EF is partially dependent on the adopted parameterization of
   time-scale parameter T in the exponential filter. Similar results are
   obtained when analyses are conducted at the monthly time scale, only
   with larger error bars. The contrast between the results of this paper
   and past work focusing on utilizing soil moisture to predict vegetation
   condition demonstrates that the particular application should be
   considered when characterizing the information content of soil moisture
   time series measurements.},

Abstract = {A method for soil moisture and surface temperature estimation in the
   Tibetan Plateau (TP) using spaceborne radiometer observations was
   presented. Based on the physical basis that the 36.5-GHz (Ka-band)
   vertical brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the topsoil
   temperature, a new surface temperature model was developed using all
   ground measurements available from three networks named CAMP/Tibet,
   Maqu, and Naqu, established in the TP, which can significantly improve
   the accuracy of surface temperature derived from the land parameter
   retrieval model (LPRM). Then, the new surface temperature model, which
   was calibrated with in situ data, was integrated into the soil moisture
   retrieval algorithm proposed in this letter using Advanced Microwave
   Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) observations. The algorithm combines the
   vegetation optical depth and roughness into an integrated factor to
   avoid making unreliable assumptions and using auxiliary data to get
   these two parameters. Finally, the algorithm was validated by ground
   measurements from the dense Naqu network and was compared with NASA
   AMSR-E and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) official algorithms.
   The results show that the proposed algorithm can provide much more
   accurate soil moisture retrievals than the other two satellite
   algorithms in the Naqu network region. The algorithm can be applied to
   the areas with spare vegetation but may not be very suitable for densely
   vegetated surfaces.},

Abstract = {Geophysical products generated from remotely sensed data require
   validation to evaluate their accuracy. Typically in situ measurements
   are used for validation, as is the case for satellite-derived soil
   moisture products. However, a large disparity in scales often exists
   between in situ measurements (covering meters to 10 s of meters) and
   satellite footprints (often hundreds of meters to several kilometers),
   making direct comparison difficult. Before using in situ measurements
   for validation, they must be ``upscaled{''} to provide the mean soil
   moisture within the satellite footprint. There are a number of existing
   upscaling methods previously applied to soil moisture measurements, but
   many place strict requirements on the number and spatial distribution of
   soil moisture sensors difficult to achieve with permanent/semipermanent
   ground networks necessary for long-term validation efforts. A new method
   for upscaling is presented here, using Random Forests to fit a model
   between in situ measurements and a number of landscape parameters and
   variables impacting the spatial and temporal distributions of soil
   moisture. The method is specifically intended for validation of the NASA
   soil moisture active passive (SMAP) products at 36-, 9-, and 3-km
   scales. The method was applied to in situ data from the SoilSCAPE
   network in California, validated with data from the SMAPVEX12 campaign
   in Manitoba, Canada with additional verification from the TxSON network
   in Texas. For the SMAPVEX12 site, the proposed method was compared to
   extensive field measurements and was able to predict mean soil moisture
   over a large area more accurately than other upscaling approaches.},

   significantly correlated with P extracted by Olsen and AB-DTPA. In the

   Soil Moisture Estimation for Runoff Prediction},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {31},
Number = {5},
Pages = {1713-1727},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In one of the widely used methods to estimate surface runoff -Soil
   Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN), the antecedent moisture
   condition (AMC) is categorized into three AMC levels causing irrational
   abrupt jumps in estimated runoff. A few improved SCS-CN methods have
   been developed to overcome several in-built inconsistencies in the soil
   moisture accounting (SMA) procedure that lies behind the SCS-CN method.
   However, these methods still inherit the structural inconsistency in the
   SMA procedure. In this study, a modified SCS-CN method was proposed
   based on the revised SMA procedure incorporating storm duration and a
   physical formulation for estimating antecedent soil moisture (V0). The
   proposed formulation for V-0 estimation has shown a high degree of
   applicability in simulating the temporal pattern of soil moisture in the
   experimental plot. The modified method was calibrated and validated
   using a dataset of 189 storm-runoff events from two experimental
   watersheds in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results indicated that the
   proposed method, which boosted the model efficiencies to 88\% in both
   calibration and validation cases, performed better than the original
   SCS-CN and the Singh et al. (2015) method, a modified SCS-CN method
   based on SMA. The proposed method was then applied to a third watershed
   using the tabulated CN value and the parameters of the minimum
   infiltration rate (f(c)) and coefficient (beta) derived for the first
   two watersheds. The root mean square error between the measured and
   predicted runoff values was improved from 6 mm to 1 mm. Moreover, the
   parameter sensitivity analysis indicated that the potential maximum
   retention (S) parameter is the most sensitive, followed by f(c). It can
   be concluded that the modified SCS-CN method, may predict surface runoff
   more accurately in the Chinese Loess Plateau.},

Abstract = {Soil infiltrability, or infiltration capacity, is the rate at which
   water penetrates into the soil at a rate directly controlled by soil
   factors alone. The infiltrability is of great importance in
   understanding and managing hydrological processes, crop water supply,
   irrigation, and soil erosion. The infiltration dynamics measured with
   the run off-on-out (ROOO) method follows the changes in infiltrability
   during the infiltration process under rainfall conditions. In this
   study, the ROOO method was used to quantitatively measure the soil
   infiltrability under three rainfall intensities (20, 40 and 60 mm/h) and
   three antecedent soil moisture contents (2.6\%, 10.4\% and 19.5\%,
   equivalent to 7.5\% (air-dry), 30\% and 60\% of field capacity,
   respectively, of a clay loam soil. The soil infiltrability determined by
   the ROOO method decreased with increase in initial soil water content,
   due to the lower hydraulic gradient at the wetting front. Surface seal
   formation due to raindrop impact had a significant influence on soil
   infiltrability and was related to the soil water content. The faster
   wetting rate of drier soil under higher rainfall intensities, or when
   using the double-ring infiltrometer for comparison, caused severe
   aggregate breakdown to promote surface sealing, and significant decrease
   in soil infiltrability. Cumulative infiltration increased rapidly at the
   beginning of the infiltration process and then increased approximately
   linearly with time as the infiltration rate approached to constant. The
   rate of increase in cumulative infiltration was less under higher
   initial soil water contents, especially in the initial rainfall stage.
   Moreover, lower rainfall intensity resulted in higher infiltration rates
   and greater cumulative infiltration. The soil infiltrability processes
   measured with the ROOO method were fitted better by Kostiakov, Horton
   and Philip infiltration models than those measured by the double-ring
   infiltrometer method. The ROOO method provided reliable data for the
   entire infiltration process without the limitations of conventional
   rainfall simulation during the initial phase or of the drawbacks of the
   double-ring infiltrometer method. The results will have introductory
   meanings to further studies along this line. (C) 2010 Published by

Journal = {SOIL RESEARCH},

Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {338-348},
Abstract = {Human activities and topography are main factors affecting soil nutrient
   variation. However, the relationships between these factors are both
   site- and scale-specific. In hilly areas of south-western China, the
   dominant cropping systems are rice, vegetables, oranges, Chinese red
   pepper and maize-sweet potato intercropping. In the present study, slope
   position (valley, low slope, flat slope, middle slope, upper slope,
   ridge) and aspect (north, east, south, west) were derived to investigate
   the relationships among cropping system, terrain, and soil nutrients at
   county scale. Crops were mainly planted at middle or flat slope
   positions. Rice and orange plants were evenly distributed across the
   aspects whereas vegetables were mostly planted on the northern aspect.
   Red pepper and maize-sweet potato plants were mainly grown on the
   western and southern aspects. Rice sites had higher contents of organic
   matter and available nitrogen (N) and lower contents of available
   phosphorus (P) and available potassium (K). For dryland cropping
   systems, vegetable sites had higher contents of organic matter,
   available N, and available P. Red pepper sites had higher contents of
   available K. Contents of organic matter and available N were generally
   higher at lower landscape positions. Contents of available K were higher
   at lower and flat slope positions. Contents of available P were higher
   at higher landscape positions. Contents of organic matter and available
   N were higher on the northern and eastern, and lower on the western
   aspects. Contents of available P were higher on the western and lower on
   the northern aspects. No significant differences were found for
   available K across the aspects. Classification tree algorithms indicated
   that relative importance of the variables on soil nutrient variation was
   in the order: (i) cropping system, (ii) slope position, and (iii)
   aspect.},

Abstract = {Riparian ecosystems have critical impacts on controlling the non-point
   source pollution and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. In
   this study, a process oriented soil denitrification model was extended
   with algorithms from a simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to
   land surface remote sensing data to enhance its performance in spatial
   and temporal prediction of gaseous N emissions from soils in the
   riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting reservoir (China). The N
   emission model is based on chemical and physical relationships that
   govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen movement
   in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes
   nitrification. denitrification and ammonia (NH3) volatilization. SPOT-5
   and Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface
   information and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also
   used to drive the model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation
   experiment was used to estimate the soil denitrification model
   parameters for the different soil types. An in situ field-scale
   experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil temperature,
   moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to verify
   simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of
   R-2 = 0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was
   applied to the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial
   resolution (10 m) of the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed
   that soil moisture was the most sensitive parameter for gaseous N
   emissions and soil denitrification was the main process affecting N
   losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the aspect of land
   use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial structure and
   distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area
   should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the
   wetland ecological system surrounding this strategically important water
   resource. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Silvopastoral systems (SPS) have been suggested as an approach to reduce
   pasture degradation and, consequently, reduce the deforestation of new
   areas in the Brazilian cerrado (savanna). This study assessed the
   contribution of trees to soil fertility in a silvopastoral system in
   Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, 19A degrees 35' 36aEuro(3) S,
   43A degrees 51' 56aEuro(3) W; altitude 747 m. The SPS has developed
   since 1984, through the use of natural regeneration of the native
   species Zeyheria tuberculosa Vell. Bur., with a density of 160 trees
   ha(-1). The forage component of the system was Brachiaria brizantha cv.
   Marandu. The control treatment was a pasture adjacent to SPS with the
   same forage but without the influence of trees. In 2005, the litterfall
   of trees (leaves, fruits, and stems) was collected monthly, and the dry
   matter yield and nutrient content were measured. Soil profile samples
   were collected in February 2006. The litterfall of trees represented
   considerable inputs of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca2+).
   In the soil, organic matter (OM) and K reduced with depth. At this
   planting density, this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration
   of soil acidity, in the 0-2 cm layer and/or in the profile as a whole.
   In contrast, there were no significant differences in N, P, and K
   content of the control and SPS soil. This can be related to the high C/N
   and lignin/N ratios of the litter inputs. Agroforestry systems are
   complex and the site specific interactions among the components (tree,
   forage, and animal) must be understood to develop locally adapted
   systems and optimize productive efficiency. Consequently simple
   prescriptions for the implementation of SPS by land managers are
   unlikely.},

Abstract = {Research data on soil quality are scarce in Madagascar, despite the
   island's widely recognized problems of soil and environmental
   degradation. One of the major constraints to properly assessing current
   status, trends and processes of soil degradation is the high level of
   costs involved when using conventional soil analytical methods. Previous
   studies have demonstrated that visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR)
   reflectance spectroscopy may permit rapid and cost effective analysis of
   tropical soils that could provide new opportunities for farmers, land
   managers, local authorities and researchers in assessing and managing
   soil quality. This study tested the potential of Vis-NIR soil spectral
   libraries for predicting and mapping soil properties in the eastern
   highlands of Madagascar. Stable calibration models were developed for
   several key soil properties. Cross-validated r(2) values were soil
   organic carbon (SOC), 0.94; total nitrogen (TN), 0.96; and cation
   exchange capacity (CEC), 0.80. A spectral soil fertility index (SFI) was
   developed based on ten commonly used agronomic indicators of soil
   fertility. SFI varied significantly with current and historic land use.
   The index was successfully calibrated to both soil reflectance measured
   in the laboratory (p = 0.003) and Landsat TM reflectance (p = 0.003),

Title = {Uncertainties of Water Fluxes in Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer
   Models: Inverting Surface Soil Moisture and Evapotranspiration Retrieved

Abstract = {Effective hydraulic parameters of soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer
   (SVAT) models can be derived by inverting observed surface soil
   moisture, theta(obs), and evapotranspiration, ETobs, retrieved from
   remote sensing. We investigated the uncertainties in simulating the
   water fluxes of contrasting hydroclimatic scenarios for which it was
   assumed that theta(obs) had a RMSE of 0.04 m(3) m(-3) (Delta theta(obs))
   and ETobs had a relative error of 20\% (Delta ETobs). The correlation of
   the uncertainties in the simulated water fluxes (Delta WFsim) with Delta
   theta(obs) and Delta ETobs was derived with the proposed Uncertainty
   Simulator Algorithm. The results show that Delta WFsim is influenced by
   climate and increases when the climate is drier. The uncertainty in
   estimated root-zone. was found to be correlated with Delta theta(obs).
   The prediction of evaporation contained large uncertainties and was
   correlated with the actual/potential evapotranspiration ratio. The
   uncertainties in transpiration under dry climates were high and were
   correlated with Delta ETobs; however, the uncertainty under wet climates
   was insignificant. The uncertainties in groundwater recharge under dry
   climates were large but were reduced under wet climates. Furthermore,
   uncertainties in groundwater recharge were correlated with Delta ETobs
   but not with Delta theta(obs). In general, the Delta WFsim increases as
   (i) climate gets drier, (ii) texture gets coarser, or (iii) roots grow
   deeper. The uncertainty in recharge is explained by soil moisture and
   transpiration decoupling. Soil moisture decoupling occurs when the
   information provided by surface theta is no longer representative of
   root-zone theta. Transpiration decoupling occurs when there is
   substantially more water storage at depth. We propose methodology to
   reduce the nonuniqueness of the inverted hydraulic parameters.},

Title = {Downscaling Satellite-Based Soil Moisture in Heterogeneous Regions Using

   Synthetic Study},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {53},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In this study, a novel methodology based upon the information-theoretic
   measures of entropy and mutual information was implemented to downscale
   soil moisture (SM) observations from 10 km to 1 km. It included a
   transformation function that related auxiliary remotely sensed (RS)
   products at high resolution to in situ SM observations to obtain first
   estimates of SM at 1 km and merging this estimate with SM at coarse
   resolutions through Principle of Relevant Information (PRI). The
   PRI-based estimates were evaluated using synthetic observations in NC
   Florida for heterogeneous agricultural land covers (LC), with two
   growing seasons of sweet corn and one of cotton, annually. The
   cumulative density function showed an overall error in SM of < 0.03
   cubic meter/cubic meter in the region, with a confidence interval of
   95\% during the simulation period. The PRI estimates at 1 km were also
   compared with those from the method based upon Universal Triangle (UT).
   The spatially averaged root mean square error (RMSE) aggregated over the
   vegetative LC were 0.01 cubic meter/cubic meter and 0.15 cubic
   meter/cubic meter using the PRI and UT methods, respectively. The RMSE
   for downscaled estimates using the UT method increased to 0.28 cubic
   meter/cubic meter when Laplacian errors are used, while the
   corresponding RMSE for the PRI remains the same for both Laplacian or
   Gaussian errors. The Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD) for estimates
   using PRI is about 50\% lower than those using the method based upon UT
   indicating that the probability density function (PDF) of the PRI
   estimate is closer to PDF of the true SM, than the UT method.},

Title = {A Coupling Model for Soil Moisture Retrieval in Sparse Vegetation
   Covered Areas Based on Microwave and Optical Remote Sensing Data},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important component of natural water cycles and
   plays a crucial role for the healthy development of ecological
   environment in arid and semiarid areas. Microwave remote sensing
   techniques are promising to rapidly monitor regional soil moisture.
   However, major difficulties associated with retrieving soil moisture via
   microwave remote sensing are attributed to effects of surface roughness
   and vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to investigate the
   potentials of combined roughness parameters and develop a model that
   mostly relies on the satellite data and requires minimum a priori
   information for soil moisture inversion over sparse vegetation covered
   areas through combing Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GF-1
   data. For the purpose, the impacts of vegetation on the radar
   backscattering coefficient were removed by the water-cloud model (WCM)
   and a new roughness parameter Zs (Zs = S-3/L is defined as a combined
   roughness parameter) was proposed by simulating relationships between
   surface roughness parameters, soil moisture, and backscattering
   coefficients using advanced integral equation model (AIEM). On the
   basis, a coupling model of soil moisture inversion for blown-wind areas
   of the Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, China, was in turn developed with
   Radarsat-2 HH and VV polarization data, and the soil moisture content
   (SMC) values for sparse vegetation covered surfaces were retrieved with
   limited use of in situ roughness parameters. The in situ measurements
   and satellite data set were used to validate the reliability of the
   developed model. The results showed that the retrieved soil moisture
   levels fell below in situ soil moisture levels before the vegetation
   effect was removed, and the precision of retrieved soil moisture was
   effectively improved when the vegetation effect was corrected by the
   WCM, with the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error decreasing
   from 7.45\% and 6.24\% to 5.12\% and 3.44\%, respectively. According to
   the map of retrieved soil moisture levels generated for the study area,
   most of SMCs were below 35\% in accordance with field observations.
   These study results can serve as a foundation for monitoring soil
   moisture and water environments in arid and semiarid regions.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the effects of soil moisture
   content on the absorbance spectra of sandy soils with different
   phosphorus (P) concentrations using ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and
   near-infrared (NIR) absorbance spectroscopy. Sieve sizes were 125, 250,
   and 600 mu m for fine, medium, and coarse, respectively. The medium size
   of the samples was usedfor the study. Investigations were conducted at
   0, 12.5, 62.5, 175, 375, 750, and 1000 mg kg(-1) P application rates.
   Three soil moisture contents (4\%, 8\%, and 12\%) were investigated. P
   concentrations of the soil samples were analyzed and reflectance of the
   samples was measured between 225 and 2550 nm with a 1 nm interval. Dried
   soil samples reflected more light than wet soil in the 225-2550 mn
   range. As moisture content of the soils increased, reflectance from the
   soil sample decreased, which indicates that water is a strong light
   absorber in sandy soils. Dry soil spectra were reconstructed from the
   wet soil spectra by removing the moisture content effect and compared
   with the dry spectra of the same soil sample. Absorbance and
   reconstructed absorbance data were prepared as calibration and
   validation data sets in order to measure the Performance of the spectral
   signal processing used for removing the moisture content effect on
   absorbance spectra. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was applied
   to the data to predict P concentration before and after processing the
   spectra. The results showed that removing the moisture effect by
   spectral signal processing considerably improved prediction of P in
   soils.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and land data assimilation purport to
   improve the quality of antecedent soil moisture information available
   for operational hydrologic forecasting. We objectively validate this
   claim by calculating the strength of the relationship between
   storm-scale runoff ratio (i.e., total streamflow divided by total
   rainfall accumulation in depth units) and prestorm surface soil moisture
   estimates from a range of surface soil moisture data products. Results
   demonstrate that both satellite-based, L band microwave radiometry and
   the application of land data assimilation techniques have significantly
   improved the utility of surface soil moisture data sets for forecasting
   streamflow response to future rainfall events.
   Plain Language Summary Forecasting streamflow conditions is important
   for minimizing loss of life and property during flooding and adequately
   planning for low streamflow conditions accompanying drought. One way to
   improve these forecasts is measuring the amount of water in the
   soilsince soil moisture conditions determine what fraction of rainfall
   will run off horizontally into stream channels (versus vertically
   infiltrate into the soil column). Within the past 5years, there have
   been important advances in our ability to monitor soil moisture over
   large scales using both satellite-based sensors and the application of
   new land data assimilation techniques. This paper illustrates that these
   advances have significantly improved our capacity to forecast how much
   streamflow will be generated by future precipitation events. These
   results may eventually be used by operational forecasters to improve
   flash flood forecasting and agricultural water use management.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an approach for retrieval of soil moisture content
   (SMC) from different satellite sensors with a focus on mountain areas.
   The novelties of the paper are: the extension of an already developed
   method to coarse resolution data (150 m) in mountain environment with
   high land heterogeneity, with only VV polarization and the proper
   selection of input features. During the result analysis, several
   algorithm characteristics were clearly identified: 1) the performances
   showed to be strongly related to input features such as topography and
   vegetation indices; 2) the algorithm needs a training phase; 3) the
   averaging window needs to be proper selected to take into account both
   the speckle noise and the characteristics of the area under
   investigation; and 4) the algorithm, being data driven, can be
   considered as site dependent. The experimental analysis is carried out
   on images acquired over the Sudtirol/Alto Adige Province in Italy during
   2010-2011 from the RADARSAT2 and Envisat ASAR in Wide Swath mode. SMC
   maps were compared with spatially distributed ground measurements,
   resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) value ranging from 0.045
   to 0.07 m(3)/m(3). Concerning the multiscale analysis, the results
   indicated that RADARSAT2 maps are able to detect the spatial
   heterogeneity and soil moisture dynamics at local scale, while ASAR WS
   SMC maps are able to identify mainly the two main classes of pasture and
   meadows. When these estimates are compared with SMC values from
   meteorological stations a RMSE value of 0.10 m(3)/m(3) for both
   satellites indicated a reduced capability to follow the temporal

Title = {A linear mixed effect (LME) model for soil water content estimation
   based on geophysical sensing: a comparison of an LME model and kriging
   with external drift},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {73},

Pages = {1951-1960},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) is a critical attribute in precision
   irrigation. Direct measurements are costly and relative sparse, so there
   is interest in methods to predict SWC at unsampled sites from sampled
   data. The precision of such predictions can be improved, if covariates
   are incorporated into the predictor. To do that, two efficient ways are:
   (1) linear mixed effect model (LME), in which the spatial process is
   obtained by splitting the total variability in a systematic term or mean
   effect, a spatially correlated component and a random noise, and (2)
   kriging with external drift (KED), a nonstationary geostatistical
   technique, assuming covariates to have a linear effect on target
   variable. Geoelectric sensors provide noninvasive information on soil.
   Their outputs are quite sensitive to SWC; therefore, they can be used as
   covariates in SWC predictor. The objective of this work was to compare
   LME and KED, based on geophysical sensing, to estimate shallow SWC. The
   surveys were conducted in a south-eastern Italy field, using GPR at two
   frequencies, 600 and 1,600 MHz, and EMI. Volumetric soil water contents
   were measured with a Time Domain Reflectometer at 96 locations. Three
   LMEs, using three correlation functions (spherical, exponential, and
   Gaussian), were used and compared with KED using a set of
   cross-validation criteria. The mixed models showed a quite similar
   behavior even if exponential model outperformed the other two. The
   covariates used in the mixed models and in KED predictor were different
   and the results of cross-validation showed a slight out-performance of
   KED.},

Abstract = {Information on soil moisture is important for crop and water management.
   This study investigated soil moisture variability in relation to rice
   cropping systems in the Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam, using MODIS data
   acquired from January to April, 2002 to 2007. The soil moisture was
   estimated using the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). This
   index was empirically calculated by parameterizing the relationship
   between the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The rice cropping systems were
   classified using time-series MODIS NDVI data for 2002 and 2006. The data
   were processed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), principal
   component analysis (PCA) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC)
   methods. Various spatial and non-spatial data were also collected for
   accuracy validation of the TVDI and classification results. Comparisons
   reveal good agreement between the TVDI and daily rainfall data. The
   areas with low soil moisture were mainly distributed in coastal areas
   from 2002 to 2005, but expanded into the middle of the MD in 2006 and
   2007. The largest area of low soil moisture was observed in 2006.
   Classification of rice cropping systems reveals an overall accuracy and
   Kappa coefficient for 2002 of 76.3\% and 0.68, respectively while the
   values for 2006 were 76.9\% and 0.69, respectively. To relate soil
   moisture with rice cropping systems, we aggregated the composite soil
   moisture maps (considering dry and very dry classes only) with the rice
   crop maps for 2002 and 2006. The results indicate a remarkable increase
   in the area of double and triple irrigated rice cropping systems in
   areas of low soil moisture (i.e., dry and very dry conditions) during
   this period. This study demonstrated the merits of using MODIS data for
   studying soil variability in relation to rice crops which is important
   for crop and water management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) and water content (WC) in the root zone are two
   major hydro-meteorological parameters that exhibit a dominant control on
   water, energy and carbon fluxes, and are therefore important for any
   regional eco-hydrological or climatological study. To investigate the
   potential for retrieving these parameter from hyperspectral remote
   sensing, we have investigated plant spectral reflectance (400-2,500 nm,
   ASD FieldSpec3) for two major agricultural crops (sugar beet and spring
   barley) in the mid-latitudes, treated under different water and nitrogen
   (N) conditions in a greenhouse experiment over the growing period of
   2008. Along with the spectral response, we have measured soil water
   content and LAI for 15 intensive measurement campaigns spread over the
   growing season and could demonstrate a significant response of plant
   reflectance characteristics to variations in water content and nutrient
   conditions. Linear and non-linear dimensionality analysis suggests that
   the full band reflectance information is well represented by the set of
   28 vegetation spectral indices (SI) and most of the variance is
   explained by three to a maximum of eight variables. Investigation of
   linear dependencies between LAI and soil WC and pre-selected SI's
   indicate that: (1) linear regression using single SI is not sufficient
   to describe plant/soil variables over the range of experimental
   conditions, however, some improvement can be seen knowing crop species
   beforehand; (2) the improvement is superior when applying multiple
   linear regression using three explanatory SI's approach. In addition to
   linear investigations, we applied the non-linear CART (Classification
   and Regression Trees) technique, which finally did not show the
   potential for any improvement in the retrieval process.},

Abstract = {Besides its important role in the energy and water balance at the
   soil-atmosphere interface, soil moisture can be a particular important
   factor in mountain environments since it influences the amount of
   freezing and thawing in the subsurface and can affect the stability of
   slopes.
   In spite of its importance, the technical challenges and its strong
   spatial variability usually prevents soil moisture from being measured
   operationally at high and/or middle altitudes. This study describes the
   new Swiss soil moisture monitoring network SOMOMOUNT (soil moisture in
   mountainous terrain) launched in 2013. It consists of six entirely
   automated soil moisture stations distributed along an altitudinal
   gradient between the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps, ranging from
   1205 to 3410ma.s.l. in elevation. In addition to the standard
   instrumentation comprising frequency domain sensor and time domain
   reflectometry (TDR) sensors along vertical profiles, soil probes and
   meteorological data are available at each station.
   In this contribution we present a detailed description of the SOMOMOUNT
   instrumentation and calibration procedures. Additionally, the liquid
   soil moisture (LSM) data collected during the first 3 years of the
   project are discussed with regard to their soil type and climate
   dependency as well as their altitudinal distribution. The observed
   elevation dependency of LSM is found to be non-linear, with an increase
   of the mean annual values up to similar to 2000ma.s.l. followed by a
   decreasing trend towards higher elevations. This altitude threshold
   marks the change between precipitation/evaporation-controlled and
   frost-affected LSM regimes. The former is characterized by high LSM
   throughout the year and minimum values in summer, whereas the latter
   typically exhibits long-lasting winter minimum LSM values and high
   variability during the summer.},

Title = {High-resolution ground-penetrating radar monitoring of soil moisture
   dynamics: Field results, interpretation, and comparison with unsaturated
   flow model},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {48},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Surface ground-penetrating radar (GPR) techniques have been used by a
   number of previous researchers to characterize soil moisture content in
   the vadose zone. However, limited temporal sampling and low resolution
   near the surface in these studies greatly impedes the quantitative
   analysis of vertical soil moisture distribution and its associated
   dynamics within the shallow subsurface. To further examine the capacity
   of surface GPR, we have undertaken an extensive 26 month field study
   using concurrent high-frequency (i.e., 900 MHz) reflection profiling and
   common-midpoint (CMP) soundings to quantitatively monitor soil moisture
   distribution and dynamics within the shallow vadose zone. This
   unprecedented data set allowed us to assess the concurrent use of these
   techniques over two contrasting annual cycles of soil conditions.
   Reflection profiles provided high-resolution traveltime data between
   four stratigraphic reflection events while cumulative results of the CMP
   sounding data set produced precise depth estimates for those reflecting
   interfaces, which were used to convert interval-traveltime data into
   soil moisture. The downward propagation of major infiltration episodes
   associated with seasonal and transient events are well resolved by the
   GPR data. The use of CMP soundings permitted the determination of direct
   ground wave velocities, which provided high-resolution information along
   the air-soil interface. This improved resolution enabled better
   characterization of short-duration wetting/drying and freezing/thawing
   processes, and permitted better evaluation of the nature of the coupling
   between shallow and deep moisture conditions. The nature of transient
   infiltration pulses, evapotranspiration episodes, and deep drainage
   patterns observed in the GPR data series were further examined by
   comparing them with a vertical soil moisture flow simulation based on
   the variably saturated model, HYDRUS-1D. Using laboratory-derived soil
   hydraulic property information from soil samples and a number of
   simplifying assumptions about the upper and lower-boundary condition, we
   were able to achieve very good agreement between measured and simulated
   soil moisture profiles without model calibration; this is a strong
   indication of the overall quality of the GPR-derived soil moisture
   estimates. The only notable difference between simulated values and GPR
   water content estimates occurred during extended dry soil conditions
   near the surface.},

Abstract = {An algorithm for pre-operational high resolution soil moisture mapping
   using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is presented. It has been
   conceived to be inserted in the operational weather alert system of the
   Italian Department of Civil Protection. The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
   probability criterion is applied to retrieve soil moisture by inverting
   a forward backscattering model, and ancillary data such as optical
   images and land cover maps are also used to identify areas in which the
   retrieval can be carried out. The well-established semiempirical water
   cloud model is adopted to correct for the effect of vegetation on SAR
   data. In anticipation of the use of the algorithm in an operational
   system, in which the SAR-derived high resolution soil moisture product
   can be assimilated within weather prediction models or hydrological
   ones, an uncertainty index is associated to each estimate. The algorithm
   has been tested on a dataset consisting of ground data gathered for
   seven years (2003-2010) on an agricultural test site in Northern Italy
   and radar data provided by the C-band ENVISAT/ASAR instrument. A
   comparison, performed at field scale, between estimated and in situ soil
   moisture data has shown that, by discarding the estimates with the
   largest uncertainty, the correlation coefficient can exceed 0.80 and the
   root mean square estimation error is less than 0.05 m(3)/m(3). Moreover,
   the uncertainty index has turned out to be fairly correlated to the
   actual estimation error.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to get a better understanding of radar
   signal over irrigated wheat fields and to assess the potentialities of
   radar observations for the monitoring of soil moisture. Emphasis is put
   on the use of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data
   (Envisat/ASAR and Formosat-2). Time series of images were collected over
   the Yaqui irrigated area (Mexico) throughout one agricultural season
   from December 2007 to May 2008, together with measurements of soil and
   vegetation characteristics and agricultural practices. The comprehensive
   analysis of these data indicates that the sensitivity of the radar
   signal to vegetation is masked by the variability of soil conditions.
   On-going irrigated areas can be detected all over the wheat growing
   season. The empirical algorithm developed for the retrieval of topsoil
   moisture from Envisat/ASAR images takes advantage of the Formosat-2
   instrument capabilities to monitor the seasonality of wheat canopies.
   This monitoring is performed using dense time series of images acquired
   by Formosat-2 to set up the SAFY vegetation model. Topsoil moisture
   estimates are not reliable at the timing of plant emergence and during
   plant senescence. Estimates are accurate from tillering to grain filling
   stages with an absolute error about 9\% (0.09 m(3) m(-3), 35\% in
   relative value). This result is attractive since topsoil moisture is
   estimated at a high spatial resolution (i.e. over subfields of about 5
   ha) for a large range of biomass water content (from 5 and 65 t ha(-1))
   independently from the viewing angle of ASAR acquisition (incidence
   angles IS1 to IS6).},

Abstract = {Concentrations of trace elements in wheat grain sampled between 1967 and
   2003 from the Swedish long-term soil fertility experiments were analyzed
   using ICP-MS. The long-term effect of inorganic and organic
   fertilization on trace metal concentrations was investigated including
   the impact of atmospheric deposition and myccorhiza, whereas other
   factors such as soil conditions, crop cultivar, etc. are not discussed
   in this paper. Mean values derived from 10 experimental sites were
   reported. Significantly declining Pb and Cd concentrations in wheat
   grain could be explained by lower atmospheric deposition. Mean Se
   contents in all samples were 0.031 mg kg(-1) grain dry weight. No
   samples had sufficiently high Se concentrations for human (0.05 mg Se
   kg(-1)) or animal demand (0.1 mg Se kg(-1)). Concentrations of Co in
   wheat grain were extremely low, 0.002-0.005 mg Co kg(-1) grain dry
   weight, and far below the minimum levels required by animals, which
   applied to all fertilizer treatments. A doubling of Mo concentrations in
   grain since 1975 resulted in Cu/Mo ratios often below one, which may
   cause molybdenosis in ruminants. The increase in Mo concentrations in
   crops correlated with the decline in sulfur deposition. Concentrations
   of Cu and Fe declined in NPK-fertilized wheat as compared to
   unfertilized or manure-treated wheat. Very low concentrations of Se and
   Co and low concentrations of Fe and Cu require attention to counteract
   risks for deficiencies. The main characteristic of the study is that
   there are few significant changes over time between different fertilizer
   treatments, but throughout there are low concentrations of most trace
   elements in all treatments. In general, good agreement between
   concentrations in wheat from the long-term fertility experiments and the
   national monitoring program indicate that values are representative.},

Title = {Feasibility analysis of using inverse modeling for estimating natural

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {533},
Pages = {250-265},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Despite the importance of groundwater recharge (GR), its accurate
   estimation still remains one of the most challenging tasks in the field
   of hydrology. In this study, with the help of inverse modeling,
   long-term (6 years) soil moisture data at 34 sites from the Automated
   Weather Data Network (AWDN) were used to estimate the spatial
   distribution of GR across Nebraska, USA, where significant spatial
   variability exists in soil properties and precipitation (P). To ensure
   the generality of this study and its potential broad applications, data
   from public domains and literature were used to parameterize the
   standard Hydrus-1D model. Although observed soil moisture differed
   significantly across the AWDN sites mainly due to the variations in P
   and soil properties, the simulations were able to capture the dynamics
   of observed soil moisture under different climatic and soil conditions.
   The inferred mean annual GR from the calibrated models varied over three
   orders of magnitude across the study area. To assess the uncertainties
   of the approach, estimates of GR and actual evapotranspiration (ETa)
   from the calibrated models were compared to the GR and ETa obtained from
   other techniques in the study area (e.g., remote sensing, tracers, and
   regional water balance). Comparison clearly demonstrated the feasibility
   of inverse modeling and large-scale (>10(4) km(2)) soil moisture
   monitoring networks for estimating GR. In addition, the model results
   were used to further examine the impacts of climate and soil on GR. The
   data showed that both P and soil properties had significant impacts on
   GR in the study area with coarser soils generating higher GR; however,
   different relationships between GR and P emerged at the AWDN sites,
   defined by local climatic and soil conditions. In general, positive
   correlations existed between annual GR and P for the sites with
   coarser-textured soils or under wetter climatic conditions. With the
   rapidly expanding soil moisture monitoring networks around the globe,
   this study may have important applications in aiding water resources
   management in different regions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Due to the large volume of carbon currently stored in boreal regions and
   the high frequency of wildfire, the prospects of a warming climate would
   have important implications for the ecology of boreal forests which in
   turn would have significant feedbacks for carbon cycling, fire
   frequency, and global climate change. Since ecological studies and
   climate change models require routine information on surface soil
   moisture, the ability to remotely sense this variable is highly
   desirable. Toward this end research was conducted on developing methods
   for the retrieval of spatially and temporally varying patterns of soil
   moisture from recently burned boreal forest ecosystems of Alaska using
   C-band satellite radar data. To do this we focused on both individual
   date and temporal SAR datasets to develop techniques and algorithms
   which indicate how moisture varies across a recently burned boreal
   forest. For each of the methods developed we focused on reducing errors
   of SAR-derived soil moisture estimates due to confounding factors of
   variations in vegetative biomass and surface roughness. For the
   individual date soil moisture monitoring, we grouped test sites by a
   measurable biophysical variable, burn severity, and then developed
   algorithms relating moisture to SAR backscatter for each burn severity
   group. The algorithms developed had high coefficients of determination
   (0.56-0.82) and the moisture maps produced had high accuracy (3.61 rms
   error) based on the minimal validation conducted. For the seasonal soil
   moisture mapping we used principal component analysis to capture the
   time-variant feature of soil moisture and minimize the relatively
   time-invariant features that confound SAR backscatter. This resulted in
   good agreement between the drainage maps produced and our limited in
   situ observations and weather data. However, further validation, with
   larger sample sizes, is needed. While this study focuses on Alaska,
   research indicates that the techniques developed should be applicable to
   boreal forests worldwide.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {11},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 9},
Abstract = {Since plant mating choices are flexible and responsive to the
   environment, rates of spontaneous hybridization may vary across
   ecological clines. Developing a robust and predictive framework for
   rates of plant gene flow requires assessing the role of environmental
   sensitivity on plant reproductive traits, relative abundance, and pollen
   vectors. Therefore, across a soil moisture gradient, we quantified
   pollinator movement, life-history trait variation, and unidirectional
   hybridization rates from crop (Raphanus sativus) to wild (Raphanus
   raphanistrum) radish populations. Both radish species were grown
   together in relatively dry (no rain), relatively wet (double rain), or
   control soil moisture conditions in Ohio, USA. We measured wild and crop
   radish life-history, phenology and pollinator visitation patterns. To
   quantify hybridization rates from crop-to-wild species, we used a simply
   inherited morphological marker to detect F-1 hybrid progeny. Although
   crop-to-wild hybridization did not respond to watering treatments, the
   abundance of hybrid offspring was higher in fruits produced late in the
   period of phenological overlap, when both species had roughly equal
   numbers of open flowers. Therefore, the timing of fruit production and
   its relationship to flowering overlap may be more important to hybrid
   zone formation in Raphanus spp. than soil moisture or pollen vector
   movements.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a crucial parameter to determine the crop water
   requirement for irrigation. The soil moisture deficit (SMD) of the root
   zone is an indicator that can be used to determine the exact crop water
   requirement. Application of the recent technology of COsmic-ray Soil
   Moisture Observation System (Cosmos) provides continuous, integrated,
   area-based values, with a measurement radius of up to 400m, whilst being
   non-invasive. In a field experiment in Italy, the Cosmos probe was used
   over a mixed crop area during the cropping seasons of 2014 and 2015. The
   results showed that soil moisture values obtained by Cosmos were
   comparable with those obtained for the top 0-60cm layer soil moisture
   measured by sensors, soil cores, profile probes and with values
   simulated by the SALTMED model. This indicates that the Cosmos probe's
   effective depth of sensing is within the top 0-60cm. Knowing that almost
   80\% of the crop root system is accommodated within the top 0-60cm, the
   Cosmos measurement could be useful for monitoring the soil water status
   and SMD in the root zone in irrigated agriculture. The Cosmos system
   could be made operational for irrigation managers to determine when and
   how much to irrigate. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture partly controls land-atmosphere mass and energy exchanges

   both modeled and remotely sensed soil moisture require comparison with
   ground measurements at the appropriate spatiotemporal scales. One
   promising technique is the cosmic ray neutron probe. Here we further
   assess the suitability of this technique for real-time monitoring across
   a large area by combining data from three fixed probes and roving
   surveys over a 12kmx12km area in eastern Nebraska. Regression analyses
   indicated linear relationships between the fixed probe averages and
   roving estimates of soil moisture for each grid cell, allowing us to

Title = {A Framework for Diagnosing Factors Degrading the Streamflow Performance

Abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) techniques have been widely applied to assimilate
   satellite-based soil moisture (SM) measurements into hydrologic models
   to improve streamflow simulations. However, past studies have reached
   mixed conclusions regarding the degree of runoff improvement achieved
   via SM state updating. In this study, a synthetic diagnostic framework
   is designed to 1) decompose the random error components in a hydrologic
   simulation, 2) quantify the error terms that originate from SM states,
   and 3) assess the effectiveness of SM DA to correct these random errors.
   The general framework is illustrated through a case study in which
   surface Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data are assimilated into a
   large-scale land surface model in the Arkansas-Red River basin. The case
   study includes systematic error in the simulated streamflow that imposes
   a first-order limit on DA performance. In addition, about 60\% of the
   random runoff error originates directly from rainfall and cannot be
   corrected by SM DA. In particular, fast-response runoff dominates in
   much of the basin but is relatively unresponsive to state updating.
   Slow-response runoff is strongly controlled by the bottom-layer SM and
   therefore only modestly improved via the assimilation of surface
   measurements. Combined, the total runoff improvement in the synthetic
   analysis is small (<10\% over the basin). Improvements in the real
   SMAP-assimilated case are further limited due to systematic error and
   other factors such as inaccurate error assumptions and SMAP rescaling.
   Findings from the diagnostic framework suggest that SM DA alone is
   insufficient to substantially improve streamflow estimates in large
   basins.},

Abstract = {Sugarcane is a long-duration, huge biomass accumulating crop and
   requires a number of cultural and management operations from planting to
   harvesting. It is also a wonder crop where after harvesting of the main
   crop, the subsequent ratoon crop is generated through established root
   system. Adoption of green technologies is a viable option to improve
   sugarcane productivity and sustainability. Fine-tuning the green
   technologies, different methods/techniques of crop production, planting
   methods (cane node/STP technologies and planting through Cutter
   Planter), nutrient management strategies (intercropping, green manuring,
   press mud, bio-compost, bio-fertilizers, etc.), insect-pest and disease
   management options (cultural and physical methods, use of bio-agents,
   bio-pesticides, botanicals, light/pheromone or combo traps, etc.) and
   management of adverse climatic conditions (drought and flood) and/or
   crop residue recycling and trash management technologies may not only
   improve soil health and cane productivity but are also eco-friendly and
   environmentally safe. These green technological interventions are being
   applied in sugarcane and sugarcane-based production system in the
   country. Improvement in the crop productivity vis-a-vis sustaining
   natural resources is key components to be addressed through these
   technologies. Thus, reduction in cost of production, improvement in soil
   health, increased crop productivity and overall improvement in cane
   sugar productivity and farmers' income would be possible through the
   adoption of green technologies. The established green technologies in
   sugarcane production system and pre- and post-harvest management have
   potential to improve cane yield and sugar recovery besides enhancing
   farmer's income and sustainability. In this present paper, various
   aspects of increasing sugarcane and sugar yields, reducing cost of
   production and increasing farmers' income through the adoption of green
   technologies have been discussed.},

Title = {ESA CCI Soil Moisture for improved Earth system understanding:
   State-of-the art and future directions},

Year = {2017},
Volume = {203},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Climate Data Records of soil moisture are fundamental for improving our
   understanding of long-term dynamics in the coupled water, energy, and
   carbon cycles over land. To respond to this need, in 2012 the European
   Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global
   satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate
   Change Initiative (CO) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines
   various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture
   products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged
   PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to
   the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a
   large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite
   sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978-2015. In
   this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the
   characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products.
   Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show
   that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive
   release and that the merged products generally outperform the
   single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well
   with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models
   and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense
   vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties.
   Second, capitalising on the results of >100 research studies that made
   use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has
   contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth
   system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere
   interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and
   land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in
   some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in
   the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in
   numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its
   infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the
   product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in
   time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current
   ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of
   long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global
   Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for
   future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps. (C) 2017

Year = {2013},
Volume = {2},

Abstract = {Using an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE), we investigate
   the potential soil moisture retrieval capability of the National
   Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Aquarius radiometer (L-band
   1.413 GHz) and scatterometer (L-band, 1.260 GHz). We estimate potential
   errors in soil moisture retrievals and identify the sources that could
   cause those errors. The OSSE system includes (i) a land surface model in
   the NASA Land Information System, (ii) a radiative transfer and
   backscatter model, (iii) a realistic orbital sampling model, and (iv) an
   inverse soil moisture retrieval model.
   We execute the OSSE over a 1000x2200 km(2) region in the central United
   States, including the Red and Arkansas river basins. Spatial
   distributions of soil moisture retrieved from the radiometer and
   scatterometer are close to the synthetic truth. High root mean square
   errors (RMSEs) of radiometer retrievals are found over the heavily
   vegetated regions, while large RMSEs of scatterometer retrievals are
   scattered over the entire domain. The temporal variations of soil
   moisture are realistically captured over a sparely vegetated region with
   correlations 0.98 and 0.63, and RMSEs 1.28\% and 8.23\% vol/vol for
   radiometer and scatterometer, respectively. Over the densely vegetated
   region, soil moisture exhibits larger temporal variation than the truth,
   leading to correlation 0.70 and 0.67, respectively, and RMSEs 9.49\% and
   6.09\% vol/vol respectively. The domain-averaged correlations and RMSEs
   suggest that radiometer is more accurate than scatterometer in
   retrieving soil moisture. The analysis also demonstrates that the
   accuracy of the retrieved soil moisture is affected by vegetation
   coverage and spatial aggregation.},

Number = {10},

Abstract = {The cosmic-ray neutron probe measures soil moisture over tens of
   hectares, thus averaging spatially variable soil moisture fields. A
   previous paper described how variable soil moisture profiles affect the
   integrated cosmic-ray neutron signal from which depth-average soil
   moisture is computed. Here, we investigate the effect of horizontal
   heterogeneity on the relationship between neutron counts and average
   soil moisture. Observations from a distributed sensor network at a site
   in southern Arizona indicate that the horizontal component of the total
   variance of the soil moisture field is less variably in time than the
   vertical component. Using results from neutron particle transport
   simulations we show that 1-D binary distributions of soil moisture may
   affect both the mean and variance of neutron counts of a cosmic-ray
   neutron detector placed arbitrarily in a soil moisture field,
   potentially giving rise to an underestimate of the footprint average
   soil moisture. Similar simulations that used 1-D and 2-D Gaussian soil
   moisture fields indicate consistent mean and variances of a randomly
   placed detector if the correlation length scales are short (less than
   approximate to 30 m) and/or the soil moisture field variance is small
   (<0.032 m(6) m(-6)). Taken together, these soil moisture observations
   and neutron transport simulations show that horizontal heterogeneity
   likely has a small effect on the relationship between mean neutron
   counts and average soil moisture for soils under natural conditions.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to assess the behavior of the high-resolution
   COSMO model, having convection explicitly solved, to different soil

   content. Four different case studies, representing four different
   meteorological regimes, have been selected for such a purpose using
   different soil moisture fields prepared ad hoc. Results confirm that the
   model is very sensitive to the perturbation of the initial conditions of
   the soil water content, showing a significant spread increase in main
   prognostic variables, near the soil as well as upper in the atmosphere.
   These results suggest that an ensemble system, based on a
   high-resolution convection-permitting model, could benefit in terms of
   spread increase if a perturbation of the initial conditions of the soil
   moisture would be added to the classic perturbation of the atmosphere.
   For an evaluation of the performances of this kind of ensemble system, a
   comparison with observations should be performed.},

   have been exposed to a shorter period of cultivation than the soils
   under more recent field walls. Total P and P:Nb ratios of these buried

Title = {Evaluation of an empirical orthogonal function-based method to downscale
   soil moisture patterns based on topographical attributes},
Journal = {HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {26},
Number = {18},
Pages = {2696-2709},
Month = {AUG 30},
Abstract = {Soil moisture influences many hydrologic applications including
   agriculture, land management and flood prediction. Most remote-sensing
   methods that estimate soil moisture produce coarse resolution patterns,
   so methods are required to downscale such patterns to the resolutions
   required by these applications (e.g. 10- to 30-m grid cells). At such
   resolutions, topography is known to affect soil moisture patterns.
   Although methods have been proposed to downscale soil moisture based on
   topography, they usually require the availability of past
   high-resolution soil moisture patterns from the application region. The
   objective of this article is to determine whether a single
   topographic-based downscaling method can be used at multiple locations
   without relying on detailed local observations. The evaluated
   downscaling method is developed on the basis of empirical orthogonal
   function (EOF) analysis of spacetime soil moisture data at a reference
   catchment. The most important EOFs are then estimated from topographic
   attributes, and the associated expansion coefficients are estimated on
   the basis of the spatial-average soil moisture. To test the portability
   of this EOF-based method, it is developed separately using four data
   sets (Tarrawarra, Tarrawarra 2, Cache la Poudre and Satellite Station),
   and the relationships that are derived from these data sets to estimate
   the EOFs and expansion coefficients are compared. In addition, each of
   these downscaling methods is applied not only for the catchment where it
   was developed but also to the other three catchments. The results
   suggest that the EOF downscaling method performs well for the location
   where it is developed, but its performance degrades when applied to
   other catchments. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {In situ direct soil moisture monitoring suffers from crucial problems
   including bulky sensor size, disturbance of soil texture, low accuracy
   and costly sensors. This study aimed at tackling this challenge by
   developing a novel flat thin mm-sized soil moisture sensor (MSMS) using
   gold compact discs etching. MSMSs were examined in six soil samples
   (sand/silt/clay mixtures), with soil moisture in each varying from zero
   to saturated. The capacitance and resistance readings of MSMS5 were
   real-time recorded, and compared with soil moisture derived from
   conventional measurement. Both capacitance and resistance were found to
   correlate linearly with soil moisture, and the regression slopes were
   linearly correlated with soil porosity. This unique relationship
   facilitates accurate calculation of soil moisture based on MSMS readings
   for any given soil texture, which eliminates the need for tedious
   calibration of MSMS5 in field applications. Four-week stability tests of
   MSMS showed the resistance readings did not drift throughout the test
   period, and the sensor surface observation indicated anti-scratching
   capability, demonstrating high stability for long-term continuous in
   situ monitoring of soil moisture. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {With satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals becoming widely and
   continuously available, we aim to develop a method to objectively
   integrate the drought indices into one that is more accurate and
   consistently reliable. The data sets used in this paper include the Noah
   land surface model-based SM estimations,
   Atmosphere-Land-Exchange-Inverse model-based Evaporative Stress Index,
   and the satellite SM products from the Advanced Scatterometer, WindSat,
   Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and Soil Moisture Operational Product
   System. Using the Triple Collocation Error Model (TCEM) to quantify the
   uncertainties of these data, we developed an optically blended drought
   index (BDI\_b) that objectively integrates drought estimations with the
   lowest TCEM-derived root-mean-square-errors in this paper. With respect
   to the reported drought records and the drought monitoring benchmarks
   including the U.S. Drought Monitor, the Palmer Drought Severity Index
   and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index products,
   the BDI\_b was compared with the sample average blending drought index
   (BDI\_s) and the RMSE-weighted average blending drought indices
   (BDI\_w). Relative to the BDI\_s and the BDI\_w, the BDI\_b performs
   more consistently with the drought monitoring benchmarks. With respect

Title = {Multi-sensor assimilation of SMOS brightness temperature and GRACE
   terrestrial water storage observations for soil moisture and shallow
   groundwater estimation},

Abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provided
   monthly global estimates of the vertically integrated terrestrial water
   storage with about 300-400-km horizontal resolution between 2002 and
   2017. Since 2009, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission
   observes global L-band brightness temperatures, which are sensitive to
   near-surface soil moisture, with a revisit time of 1-3 days at a nominal
   43-km spatial resolution. This work investigates if the multi-sensor
   assimilation of these observations into the Catchment land surface model
   can improve the estimation of 0-5 cm ``surface{''} soil moisture, 0-100
   cm ``root-zone{''} soil moisture, and shallow (unconfined) groundwater
   levels. Single-sensor GRACE or SMOS assimilation and multi-sensor GRACE
   + SMOS assimilation experiments were performed over the continental U.S.
   for 6 years (July 2010 June 2016). GRACE data assimilation mostly
   improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data
   assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The
   benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the
   multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more
   consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when
   multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the
   multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS experiment, the water storage increments
   introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are
   anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove
   water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments
   add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused
   by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE
   analysis.},

Abstract = {Transforming a weather forecast into a flood hydrograph for a watershed
   requires a series of steps: (1) gathering and preprocessing data about
   the current conditions of the watershed, such as soil moisture, snow
   cover, etc.; (2) creating or modifying a hydrologic model; (3) running
   the model; and (4) assessing the results. Adequately performing all
   these steps in a short period of time as a major storm is approaching is
   in many cases extremely difficult. In this paper the authors present a
   method that enables performing the steps 2, 3, and 4, in advance of a
   flooding crisis by determining a large set of potential ``scenarios{''}
   (combination of parameters), running a model for each, and storing the
   results. The researchers analyze a way to create the scenarios so to
   maximize the uniformity of their distribution on the parameters space.
   They present a simple technique to retrieve the stored result that best
   matches the current conditions. The authors illustrate this method in a
   test case, for which seven model parameters were selected and more than
   2,000 scenarios were generated and pre-computed. (C) 2015 American

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2010},
Volume = {114},
Number = {11},
Pages = {2417-2430},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {This paper discusses the effects of vegetation on C- (4.75 GHz) and L-
   (1.6 GHz) band backscattering (sigma degrees) measured throughout a
   growth cycle at incidence angles of 15, 35 and 55 degrees. The utilized
   sigma degrees data set was collected by a truck mounted scatterometer
   over a corn field and is supported by a comprehensive set of ground
   measurements, including soil moisture and vegetation biomass. Comparison
   of sigma degrees measurement against simulations by the Integral
   Equation Method (IEM) surface scattering model (Fung et al., 1992) shows
   that the sigma degrees measurements are dominated either by an
   attenuated soil return or by scattering from vegetation depending on the
   antenna configuration and growth stage. Further, the measured sigma
   degrees is found to be sensitive to soil moisture even at peak biomass
   and large incidence angles, which is attributed to scattering along the
   soil-vegetation pathway.
   For the simulation of C-band sigma degrees and the retrieval of soil
   moisture two methods have been applied, which are the semi-empirical
   water cloud model (Attema \& Ulaby, 1978) and a novel method. This
   alternative method uses the empirical relationships between the
   vegetation water content (W) and the ratio of the bare soil and the
   measured sigma degrees to correct for vegetation. It is found that this
   alternative method is superior in reproducing the measured sigma degrees
   as well as retrieving soil moisture. The highest retrieval accuracies
   are obtained at a 35 degrees incidence angle leading to RMSD's of 0.044
   and 0.037 m(3) m(-3) for the HH and VV-polarization, respectively. In
   addition, the sensitivity of these soil moisture retrievals to W and
   surface roughness parameter uncertainties is investigated. Published by

Abstract = {NASA's Earth System Science Pathfinder Hydrospheric States (Hydros)
   mission will provide the first global scale space-borne observations of
   Earth's soil moisture using both L-band microwave radiometer and radar
   technologies. In preparation for the Hydros mission, an observation
   system simulation experiment (OSSE) has been conducted. As a part of
   this OSSE, the potential for retrieving useful surface soil moisture at
   spatial resolutions of 9 and 3 km was explored. The approach involved
   optimally merging relatively accurate 36-km radiometer brightness
   temperature and relatively noisy 3-km radar backscatter cross section
   observations using a Bayesian method. Based on the Hydros OSSE data sets
   with low and high noises added to the simulated observations or model
   parameters, the Bayesian method performed better than direct inversion
   of either the brightness temperature or radar backscatter observations
   alone. The root-mean-square errors of 9-km soil moisture retrievals from
   the Bayesian merging method were reduced by 0.5 \%vol/vol and 1.4
   \%vol/vol from the errors of direct radar inversions for the entire OSSE
   domain of all 34 consecutive days for the low and high noise data sets,
   respectively. Improvement in soil moisture estimates using the Bayesian
   merging method over the direct inversions of radar or radiometer data
   were even more significant for soil moisture retrieval at 3-km
   resolution. However, to address the representativeness of these results
   at the global and multiyear scales, further performance comparison
   studies are needed, particularly with actual field data.},

Abstract = {The presence of data gaps is always a concern in geophysical records,
   creating not only difficulty in interpretation but, more importantly,

   three-dimensional method based on discrete cosine transforms, which
   explicitly utilizes information from both time and space to predict the
   missing values. To analyze its performance, the method was applied to a
   global soil moisture product derived from satellite images. We also
   executed a validation by introducing synthetic gaps. It is shown this
   method is capable of filling data gaps in the global soil moisture
   dataset with very high accuracy. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry
   (GNSS-IR) is a new remote-sensing technique; it can be used to estimate
   near-surface soil moisture from signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data.
   Considering the advantages of multi-satellite convergence and the time
   and space scale of soil moisture, based on multi-satellite fusion,
   non-linear sliding estimation method of soil moisture is proposed.
   Firstly, the direct and reflection signals of Global Navigation
   Satellite System (GNSS) satellites are separated by means of a low-order
   polynomial fitting, and then, by establishing the sinusoidal fitting
   model of reflection signals, the relative delay phase of the SNR
   interferogram is obtained. Finally, a linear regression model is used to
   analyse and select the phase of the SNR interferogram, and a sliding
   estimation method of soil moisture using the least squares Support
   Vector Machine based on multi-satellites fusion is established. Based on
   the monitoring data provided by the Plate Boundary Observations network,
   the feasibility and effectiveness of using single and multiple GNSS
   satellites to slide estimate soil moisture are compared and analysed.
   Theoretical analysis and experimentation show that GNSS-IR can provide
   full play to the advantages of artificial intelligence and effectively
   integrate the performance of each satellite. The fitting process is
   stable, and the model needs less modelling data; the sliding method can
   achieve a long time estimation, and the estimation error is relatively
   stable. Based on the satellites which the correlation coefficient (r)
   between the phase of the SNR interferogram and the soil moisture is
   greater than 0.50, the fusion satellites model is established; the
   results are better than that of using single satellites; the r between
   estimated results and reference values of soil moisture is greater than
   or equal to 0.94, and the root mean square error and mean absolute error
   are less than 0.060 and 0.050, respectively. Therefore, the estimation
   of soil moisture can be treated as a non-linear event, and multi-
   satellite fusion estimation is feasible and effective.},

Abstract = {To develop a sampling strategy of surface soil moisture, a random
   combination method (RCM) was proposed and used to estimate the necessary
   sampling size (NSS) of soil moisture at different sampling areas. The
   RCM was developed based on the bootstrap sampling procedure and
   consideration of all possible sub-sampling combinations of available
   data. To examine the method, field experiments were conducted in
   sampling domains of 10 x 10, 20 x 20, 40 x 40, 55 x 55, 80 x 80, and 160
   x 160 m(2). Comparisons of the RCM with other commonly used sampling
   methods, including the statistical, geostatistical, stratified sampling,
   and bootstrap methods, indicated that the RCM provided rational and
   efficient sampling strategies. Under the same accuracy, estimated NSS
   values using the RCM were much smaller than those by the statistical and
   bootstrap methods. In addition, the RCM has the advantage of requiring
   less input information, whereas the statistical and stratified sampling
   methods require independent data with the normal distribution, the
   stratified sampling method requires stratified allocation information,
   and the geostatistical method requires the semivariogram model. The RCM
   was applied to estimate the NSS of soil moisture at different scales
   (i.e. squares with sides of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 m). Estimated values
   of the NSS under confidence levels of 90\% and 95\% with relative errors
   of 5\% and 10\% were linearly related to the coefficients of variation
   calculated from the experimental data. To enhance calculation efficiency
   of the RCM, the procedure was simplified using a small sub-sample size,
   which dramatically reduced the computation time for the NSS estimation.

Abstract = {According to simulation analysis of the advanced integral equation model
   (AIEM), there is a good linear relationship between emissivity and soil
   moisture under conditions of given roughness. The normalized difference
   of emissivities at 19.35GHz and 10.65GHz with vertical polarization can
   partly eliminate the influence of roughness and the squared correlation
   coefficient is about 0.985. This paper uses the normalized brightness
   temperature for retrieving soil moisture in Tibet from TRMM/TMI data.
   This method avoids parametrizing the land surface temperature which is a
   key parameter for the computation of emissivity. We make some
   sensitivity analysis for the atmosphere which is the main influence
   factor for our method. The analysis results indicate that our method is
   very good for clear days but is not very good when there is rainfall. We
   evaluate our algorithm by using the ground truth data obtained from
   GAME-Tibet and the retrieval error of soil moisture is about 0.04m3m-3
   relative to experimental data. The analysis indicates that the
   relationship obtained from the theoretical model should be revised
   through the local ground measurement data because the method is still
   influenced by roughness and vegetation. After making a regression
   revision, the retrieval error of soil moisture is under 0.02m3m-3.
   Finally, we retrieve the soil moisture in Tibet from TRMM/TMI data, and
   the distribution trend of retrieval results is consistent with the real
   world.},

   Microwave Measurements over the Mackenzie River Basin},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2013},

Number = {3},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {An approach is proposed to estimate soil moisture from Advanced
   Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E)
   6.9 GHz passive microwave observations. The approach was evaluated over
   two watersheds in the Mackenzie River Basin in northwestern Canada as a
   contribution to the Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment
   (GEWEX) study and the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS). Based on the
   sensitivity of the emitted microwave signal to soil roughness and
   vegetation parameters, a two-stage method was applied to calibrate a
   microwave radiative transfer model. Roughness parameters were determined
   using observations taken under dry conditions. Vegetation parameters
   were determined using observations taken under wet conditions. Obtained
   soil roughness and vegetation parameters were then integrated in the
   radiative transfer model to retrieve soil moisture. The performances of
   the proposed approach were evaluated against in situ observations,
   estimates from the NASA soil moisture product (AMSR-E), model-based soil
   moisture estimates from the NARR and gauge-based precipitation
   observations. The lowest RMSE of 0.0254 g/cm(3) was obtained between the
   retrieved soil moisture and in situ soil moisture. But, the RMSE between
   the NARR estimates and in situ soil moisture was 0.055 g/cm(3) and
   between the NASA AMSR-E product and in situ observation was 0.072
   g/cm(3). This implies that the proposed approach led to an improvement
   of 55\% and 72\% in the obtained RMSE over NARR and NASA AMSR-E soil
   moisture, respectively. It is noteworthy that the proposed approach is
   expandable to larger watersheds and very appropriate for remote regions
   like the Mackenzie River Basin where information on roughness and
   vegetation are scarce.},

Abstract = {In regions affected by seasonal and permanently frozen conditions soil
   moisture influences the thermal regime of the ground as well as its ice
   content, which is one of the main factors controlling the sensitivity of
   mountain permafrost to climate changes. In this study, several well
   established soil moisture monitoring techniques were combined with data
   from geophysical measurements to assess the spatial distribution and
   temporal evolution of soil moisture at three high elevation sites with
   different ground properties and thermal regimes. The observed temporal
   evolution of measured soil moisture is characteristic for sites with
   seasonal freeze/thaw cycles and consistent with the respective
   site-specific properties, demonstrating the general applicability of
   continuous monitoring of soil moisture at high elevation areas. The
   obtained soil moisture data were then used for the calibration and
   validation of two different model approaches used in permafrost research
   in order to characterize the lateral and vertical distribution of ice
   content in the ground. Calibration of the geophysically based four-phase
   model (4PM) with spatially distributed soil moisture data yielded
   satisfactory two dimensional distributions of water-, ice-, and air
   content. Similarly, soil moisture time series significantly improved the
   calibration of the one-dimensional heat and mass transfer model COUP,

Abstract = {A fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based aluminum oxide tube packed sensor
   (ATPS) was developed for the fast detection of the soil moisture profile
   in highway slopes and subgrades. The novel ATPS consists of an aluminum
   oxide tube with a diameter of 5 mm, an optical fiber containing a
   quasi-distributed FBG sensors, a ``U{''}-shaped resistance wire, and a
   flange. There are four 0.9-mm diameter holes in the ATPS. Laboratory
   experiments were carried out to calibrate the relationship between the
   thermal response of ATPS and the soil moisture content. Two laboratory
   rainfall validation model tests were performed to validate the ATPS for
   capturing the soil moisture profile in highway slopes and subgrades.
   During the validations, the accuracy of the ATPS was quantified, and
   water infiltration through grassy and grassless ground surfaces were
   investigated. The calibrations indicate that the ATPS can detect and
   record real-time changes in the highway slope and subgrade moisture
   after rainfall, and reveal the most dangerous zones that occur at the
   connection between different construction materials. The average
   measurement accuracy of soil moisture monitoring was 0.015 m(3)/m(3).
   Please note that the connection is where cracks form easily and the soil
   hydraulic conductivity increases significantly. The test results also
   indicate that grassy cover (lawn) significantly prevents water
   infiltration during the first few minutes of rainfall (twelve minutes in
   this study), after which, however, the infiltration rate drops sharply.
   The influence of lawn on water infiltration depends on the soil
   structure, hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall time. In summary, due to
   its small size and fast detection, the ATPS is a portable probe that can
   be used for moisture monitoring in highway slopes and subgrades.},

Abstract = {This work presents the calibration and evaluation of an optical-passive
   microwave method for retrieving soil moisture (SM) at regional scale
   using remote sensing and reanalysis data. Several data sets were used,
   such as the bipolarized brightness temperature provided by SM and Ocean
   Salinity (SMOS) L3 brightness temperature product, the Normalized
   Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from moderate resolution imaging
   spectroradiometer (MODIS), the soil temperature and water content of the
   first 0-7 cm of depth from the ERA-Interim reanalysis, and 13 land cover
   classes obtained from the ECOCLIMAP database. The method was applied
   over Chile between 28 degrees S and 43 degrees S for 2010-2012. The data
   set was used to calibrate and evaluate a semiempirical approach for
   estimating SM, first by using only the data from SMOS and ERA-Interim
   and then also including the MODIS vegetation indicator. Results were
   analyzed for every land cover class using the determination coefficient
   (r(2)), the coefficients obtained from the regressions, and the unbiased
   root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD). Results showed an increase in the
   average r(2) for all classes when a vegetation index was used in the
   calibration of the approach. The increases in r(2) ranged from 3\% for
   the crop class, to 49\% for the closed shrubland class. The ubRMSD
   presented a decrease in its value of up to 1\% m(3)/m(3) for the
   woodlands, open shrublands, and woody shrublands classes and up to 2\%
   m(3)/m(3) for the closed shrubland class. These results contribute to
   the use of single linear and semiempirical regressions to estimate SM at
   regional scale based on SMOS L-band bipolarized brightness temperature.},

Title = {The optical trapezoid model: A novel approach to remote sensing of soil
   moisture applied to Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {198},
Pages = {52-68},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {The ``trapezoid{''} or ``triangle{''} model constitutes the most popular
   approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on
   coupled thermal (Le., land surface temperature) and optical RS
   observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-OptiCal
   TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel
   distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index
   (LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not
   applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g.,
   Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual
   observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel
   Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical
   relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed
   reflectance (SIR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution
   within the SIR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture
   estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the
   Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground
   truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction
   accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only
   requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain.
   The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were
   below 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with local calibration and about 0.04-0.05 cm(3)
   cm(-3) without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only
   requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which
   is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing
   of soil moisture. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Relationship between Remote Sensing Data, Plant Biomass and Soil
   Nitrogen Dynamics in Intensively Managed Grasslands under Controlled
   Conditions},
Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The sustainable use of grasslands in intensive farming systems aims to
   optimize nitrogen (N) inputs to increase crop yields and decrease
   harmful losses to the environment at the same time. To achieve this,
   simple optical sensors may provide a non-destructive, time- and
   cost-effective tool for estimating plant biomass in the field,
   considering spatial and temporal variability. However, the plant growth
   and related N uptake is affected by the available N in the soil, and
   therefore, N mineralization and N losses. These soil N dynamics and N
   losses are affected by the N input and environmental conditions, and
   cannot easily be determined non-destructively. Therefore, the question
   arises: whether a relationship can be depicted between N fertilizer
   levels, plant biomass and N dynamics as indicated by nitrous oxide (N2O)
   losses and inorganic N levels. We conducted a standardized greenhouse
   experiment to explore the potential of spectral measurements for
   analyzing yield response, N mineralization and N2O emissions in a
   permanent grassland. Ryegrass was subjected to four mineral fertilizer
   input levels over 100 days (four harvests) under controlled
   environmental conditions. The soil temperature and moisture content were
   automatically monitored, and the emission rates of N2O and carbon
   dioxide (CO2) were detected frequently. Spectral measurements of the
   swards were performed directly before harvesting. The normalized
   difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR) were moderately
   correlated with an increasing biomass as affected by fertilization
   level. Furthermore, we found a non-linear response of increasing N2O
   emissions to elevated fertilizer levels. Moreover, inorganic N and
   extractable organic N levels at the end of the experiment tended to
   increase with the increasing N fertilizer addition. However, microbial
   biomass C and CO2 efflux showed no significant differences among
   fertilizer treatments, reflecting no substantial changes in the soil
   biological pool size and the extent of the C mineralization. Neither the
   NDVI nor SR, nor the plant biomass, were related to cumulative N2O
   emissions or inorganic N at harvesting. Our results verify the
   usefulness of optical sensors for biomass detection, and show the
   difficulty in linking spectral measurements of plant traits to N
   processes in the soil, despite that the latter affects the former.},

Abstract = {Temperature as obtained by infrared remote sensing of bare soil or

   vegetation index and we explore the benefit of adding the albedo or the
   cellulose absorption index to retrieve the surface soil moisture. The
   correlation between the inferred Soil Vegetation Wetness Index and the
   true moisture content is analyzed based on the thermal infrared and

Title = {Effect of vegetation index choice on soil moisture retrievals via the
   synergistic use of synthetic aperture radar and optical remote sensing},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPLIED EARTH OBSERVATION AND GEOINFORMATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {80},
Pages = {47-57},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture
   radar (SAR) satellite constellation has provided high-quality SAR data
   with fine spatial and temporal sampling characterizations (6(similar
   to)12 revisit days at 10 m spatial resolution). When combined with
   high-resolution optical remote sensing, this data can potentially be
   used for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over vegetated areas.
   However, the suitability of different vegetation index (VI) types for
   the parameterization of vegetation water content in SAR vegetation
   scattering models requires further investigation. In this study, the
   widely-used physical-based Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is
   coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for the retrieval of
   field-scale soil moisture. Three different VIs (NDVI, EVI, and LAI)
   produced by two different satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging
   Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) are selected to examine their
   impact on the parameterization of vegetation water content, and
   subsequently, on soil moisture retrieval accuracy. Results indicate
   that, despite the different sensitivity of estimated surface roughness
   parameters to various VIs (i.e., this sensitivity is highest when
   utilizing MODIS EVI and lowest in the LAI-based model), the optimum
   roughness parameters derived from each VI exhibit no discernible
   difference. Consequently, the soil moisture retrieval accuracies show no
   noticeable sensitivity to the choice of a particular VI. Generally,
   meadow and grassland sites with small differences in VIderived roughness
   parameters exhibit good performance in soil moisture estimation. With
   respect to the relative components in the coupled model, the vegetative
   contribution to the scattering signal exceeds that of soil at VI about
   0.6 similar to 0.8 {[}-] in NDVI-based models and 0.4 similar to 0.6
   {[}-] in EVI-based models. This study provides insight into the proper
   selection of vegetation indices during the use of SAR and optical
   imagery for the retrieval of high-resolution surface soil moisture.},

Abstract = {We consider the exploitation of dielectric properties of saline deposits
   for the detection and mapping of moisture in and regions on both Earth
   and Mars. We present simulated and experimental study in order to assess
   the effect of salinity on the complex permittivity of geological
   materials and, therefore, on the radar backscattering coefficient in the
   {[}1-7 GHz] frequency range. Laboratory measurements are performed on
   sand/sodium chloride aqueous mixtures using a vectorial network analyzer
   coupled to an open-ended coaxial dielectric probe. We aim at calibrating
   and validating semiempirical dielectric mixing models. In particular, we
   evaluated the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of complex
   permittivity on the microwave frequency, water content, and salinity.
   Our results confirm that if the real part is mainly affected by the
   moisture content, the imaginary part is more sensitive to salinity. In
   addition to the classic formulas of mixing models, the
   ionic-conductivity losses, which are due to mobile ions in the saline
   solution, are taken into account in order to better assess the effect of
   salinity on the dielectric properties of mixtures. Dielectric mixing
   models are then used as input parameters for the simulation of the radar
   backscattering coefficients by means of an analytical model: the
   integral equation model. Simulation results show that salinity should
   have a significant impact on the radar backscattering recorded in
   synthetic aperture radar data in terms of the magnitude of the
   backscattering coefficient. Moreover, our results suggest that VV
   polarization provides a greater sensitivity to salinity than HH
   polarization.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture plays a critical role in many hydrological processes
   including infiltration, evaporation, and runoff. Satellite-based passive
   microwave sensors offer an effective way to observe soil moisture
   conditions over vast areas. There are currently several satellite
   systems that can detect soil moisture. Calibration, validation, and
   characterization of data received from these satellite systems are an
   ongoing process. One approach to these requirements is to collect and
   compare long-term in situ (field) measurements of soil moisture with
   remotely sensed data. The in situ measurements for this paper were
   collected at the Little River Watershed (LRW) Tifton, Georgia and
   compared to the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Microwave Imager
   (TMI) 10.65 GHz vertical and horizontial (V and H) sensors and
   vegetation density Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from
   the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period
   from 1999 through 2002. The in situ soil moisture probes exist in
   conjunction with rain gauge stations throughout the sampling region. It
   was found that the TMI was able to observe soil moisture conditions when
   vegetation levels were low. However, during several months each year
   high vegetation levels mask the soil moisture signal from the TMI. When
   the monthly averaged observation from the TMI, MODIS, and in situ probes
   were subjected to a multivariable comparison the correlation value
   increased slightly, improving the accuracy of the TMI-soil moisture
   correlation. Our results show that the TMI estimate would not result in
   an adequate monitoring of large land areas but when used in conjunction
   with other satellite sensors and in situ networks and model output can
   constitute an effective means of monitoring soil moisture of the land
   surface. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to investigate the potential of radar (ENVISAT
   ASAR and RADARSAT-2) and LANDSAT data to generate reliable soil moisture
   maps to support water management and agricultural practice in
   Mediterranean regions, particularly during dry seasons. The study is
   based on extensive field surveys conducted from 2005 to 2009 in the
   Campidano plain of Sardinia, Italy. A total of 12 small bare soil fields
   were sampled for moisture, surface roughness, and texture values. From
   field scale analysis with ENVISAT ASAR (C-band, VV polarized, descending
   mode, incidence angle from 15.0 degrees to 31.4 degrees), an empirical
   model for estimating bare soil moisture was established, with a
   coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85. LANDSAT TM5 images were also
   used for soil moisture estimation using the TVX slope
   (temperature/vegetation index), and in this case the best linear
   relationship had an R-2 of 0.81. A cross-validation on the two empirical
   models demonstrated the potential of C-band SAR data for estimation of
   surface moisture, with and R-2 of 0.76 (bias + 03\% and RMSE 7\%) for
   ENVISAT ASAR and 0.54 (bias + 13\% and RMSE 5\%) for LANDSAT TM5. The
   two models developed at plot level were then applied over the Campidano
   plain and assessed via multitemporal and spatial analyses, in the latter
   case against soil permeability data from a pedological map of Sardinia.
   Encouraging estimated soil moisture (ESM) maps were obtained for the
   SAR-based model, whereas the LANDSAT-based model would require a better
   field data set for validation, including ground data collected on
   vegetated fields. ESM maps showed sensitivity to soil drainage qualities
   or drainage potential, which could be useful in irrigation management
   and other agricultural applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Sustainable nutrient cycling in agroecosystems combining grazing and
   crops has global ramifications for protecting these ecosystems and for
   the livelihoods they support. We sought to understand environmental,
   management, and social drivers of nutrient management and sustainability
   in Andean grazing/crop systems. We assessed the impact of farmer wealth,
   fields' proximity to villages, topography, and rangeland net primary
   productivity (NPP) on mass balances for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P),
   and potassium (K) of 43 fields. Wealthier farmers applied greater total
   amounts (kg) of manure nutrients. However, higher manure application
   rates (kg ha(-1)) were associated with field proximity and NPP rather
   than wealth. Manure P inputs in far fields (> 500-m distant) were half
   those in near fields. Harvest exports increased with manure inputs (P <
   0.001) so that balances varied less than either of these flows. Erosion
   nutrient losses in steeper far fields matched crop exports, and yields
   declined with increasing field slope (P < 0.001), suggesting that
   erosion reduces productivity. Balances for P were slightly positive in
   near and far fields (+2.2 kg P ha(-1) y(-1), combined mean) when
   calculated without erosion, but zero in near fields and negative in far
   fields with erosion included (-6.1 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) in far fields).
   Near/far differences in both inputs and erosion thus drove P limitation.
   Crop K exports dominated K balances, which were negative even without
   accounting for erosion. Modeled intensification scenarios showed that
   remediating far field deficits would require P addition and erosion
   reduction. Management nested within environmental constraints (NPP,
   erosion) rather than socioeconomic status drives soil nutrient
   sustainability in these agroecosystems. Time-lags between management and
   long-term degradation are a principal sustainability challenge to
   farming in these montane grazing/crop agroecosystems.},

Abstract = {In-depth study of the soil moisture mechanisms and understanding of the
   soil moisture transport law has an important practical significance for
   regional water resources management and the challenge of the water
   resources scarcity. Using traditional methods of soil moisture
   monitoring, deep soil layers can be monitored, but continuous monitoring
   of soil moisture at the regional level cannot be achieved. Although
   remote sensing simulation models can meet regional scale needs, these
   models are confined to the surface soil layer, and research on deep soil
   moisture inversion is still lacking. This paper focuses on these two
   issues, and investigates a remote sensing-driven soil moisture
   monitoring model for the Weihe River Basin. Considering water resource
   management needs in the Weihe River Basin, we improved the structure of
   the soil moisture balance model and optimized model parameters to build
   the remote sensing driven soil moisture balance model (RS-SWBM). Based
   on soil moisture modeling, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture in
   the Weihe River Basin was analyzed. The RS-SWBM developed for the Weihe
   River Basin was validated with observational data and Global Land Data
   Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data products. Based on the
   correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were all above 0.80,
   reflecting the effectiveness of the model. The effects of different
   vegetation types on soil moisture dynamics and consumption efficiency
   were analyzed. The results indicated that different vegetation types
   experienced different seasonal variations, vertical patterns, and
   consumption efficiencies, with strong correlations existing between
   these parameters and land use as well as precipitation.},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture with satellite sensors is an effective approach
   for agricultural drought assessment. Currently, large quantities of
   sensor-derived observation data with different observation metadata
   models exist, and they require efficient and accurate methods of
   discovery. In this study, an earth observation (EO) metadata ontology
   with a spatiotemporal-spectral-enhanced structure is designed to solve
   this problem. The ontology is based on the proposed EO metadata model,
   which is composed of nonfunctional and functional sub-modules and
   supports the Open Geospatial Consortium EO profile of observations and
   measurements. Using EO metadata ontology, an application for soil
   moisture monitoring in Hubei Province in China is tested. The results
   indicate that metadata retrieval with a spatiotemporal-spectral-enhanced
   method can efficiently achieve fine-grained discovery of qualified EO
   metadata and obtain soil moisture monitoring information from sensor
   images. In summary, the spatiotemporal-spectral semantics in the
   proposed ontology demonstrate the use of EO metadata in the context of a
   soil moisture monitoring application, improving the efficiency and
   accuracy of EO metadata discovery.},

Title = {Remote monitoring of soil moisture using passive microwave-based
   techniques - Theoretical basis and overview of selected algorithms for
   AMSR-E},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {144},

Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Satellite-based passive microwave remote sensing has been shown to be a
   valuable tool in mapping and monitoring global soil moisture. The
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Aqua platform (AMSR-E) has
   made significant contributions to this application. As the result of
   agency and individual initiatives, several approaches for the retrieval
   of soil moisture from AMSR-E have been proposed and implemented.
   Although the majority of these are based on the same Radiative Transfer
   Equation, studies have shown that the resulting soil moisture estimates
   can differ significantly. A primary goal of this investigation is to
   understand these differences and develop a suitable approach to
   potentially improve the algorithm currently used by NASA in producing
   its operational soil moisture product In order to achieve this goal, the
   theoretical basis of several alternative soil moisture retrieval
   algorithms are examined. Analysis has focused on five established
   approaches: the operational algorithm adopted by NASA, which is referred
   to as the Normalized Polarization Difference algorithm, the Single
   Channel Algorithm, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, the University of
   Montana soil moisture algorithm, and the HydroAlgo Artificial Neural
   Network algorithm. Previous comparisons of these algorithms in the
   literature have typically focused on the retrieved soil moisture
   products, and employed different metrics and data sets, and have
   resulted in differing conclusions. In this investigation we attempt to
   provide a more thorough understanding of the fundamental differences
   between the algorithms and how these differences affect their
   performance in terms of range of soil moisture provided. The comparative
   overview presented in the paper is based on the operating versions of
   the source codes of the individual algorithms. Analysis has indicated
   that the differences between algorithms lie in the specific
   parameterizations and assumptions of each algorithm. The comparative
   overview of the theoretical basis of the approaches is linked to
   differences found in the soil moisture retrievals, leading to
   suggestions for improvements and increased reliability in these
   algorithms. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Title = {Satellite Soil Moisture for Agricultural Drought Monitoring: Assessment
   of SMAP-Derived Soil Water Deficit Index in Xiang River Basin, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {11},
Number = {3},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Agricultural drought can have long-lasting and harmful impacts on both
   the ecosystem and economy. Therefore, it is important to monitor and
   predict agricultural drought accurately. Soil moisture is the key
   variable to define the agricultural drought index. However, in situ soil
   moisture observations are inaccessible in many areas of the world.
   Remote sensing techniques enrich the surface soil moisture observations
   at different tempo-spatial resolutions. In this study, the Level 2
   L-band radiometer soil moisture dataset was used to estimate the Soil
   Water Deficit Index (SWDI). The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)
   dataset was evaluated with the soil moisture dataset obtained from the
   China Land Soil Moisture Data Assimilation System (CLSMDAS). The
   SMAP-derived SWDI (SMAP\_SWDI) was compared with the atmospheric water
   deficit (AWD) calculated with precipitation and evapotranspiration from
   meteorological stations. Drought monitoring and comparison were
   accomplished at a weekly scale for the growing season (April to
   November) from 2015 to 2017. The results were as follows: (1) in terms
   of Pearson correlation coefficients (R-value) between SMAP and CLSMDAS,
   around 70\% performed well and only 10\% performed poorly at the grid
   scale, and the R-value was 0.62 for the whole basin; (2) severe droughts
   mainly occurred from mid-June to the end of September from 2015 to 2017;
   (3) severe droughts were detected in the southern and northeastern Xiang
   River Basin in mid-May of 2015, and in the northern basin in early
   August of 2016 and end of November 2017; (4) the values of percentage of
   drought weeks gradually decreased from 2015 to 2017, and increased from
   the northeast to the southwest of the basin in 2015 and 2016; and (5)
   the average value of R and probability of detection between SMAP\_SWDI
   and AWD were 0.6 and 0.79, respectively. These results show SMAP has
   acceptable accuracy and good performance for drought monitoring in the
   Xiang River Basin.},

Abstract = {Increasing drought poses a big threat to food security over recent
   decades, highlighting the need for effective tools and adequate
   information for drought monitoring and mitigation. This study analyzed
   the performance of five climate-based drought indices and soil moisture
   measurements for monitoring winter wheat drought threat in China. We
   employed the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized
   Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Palmer Drought
   SeverityIndex (PDSI), the Palmer Z index and the self-calibrated Palmer
   Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). On average, soil moisture at 50-cm
   depth correlated better with winter wheat yield during October-December
   of the previous year of harvest compared to soil moisture at 10-cm and
   20-cm depths. Moreover, the 3-layer soil moisture and reference
   evapotranspiration (ETo) correlated weakly (Pearson's r<0.3) and even
   negatively with winter wheat yield. The SPI and SPEI at shorter (1-5
   months) timescales during September-December in the previous year of
   harvest showed higher correlations with winter wheat yield. The SPEI
   trend in March-June has a significant positive influence on trend in
   winter wheat yield (r>0.40, p<0.05). The climate-based drought indices
   can facilitate crop drought monitoring in water-limited regions due to
   the wide-availability of climatic data, particularly in the light of
   uncertainties arising from the crop model. Among the investigated
   indices, results revealed that the SPEI is advantageous for drought
   monitoring over the study area due to its multiscalarity and effective
   characterization of agricultural droughts. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Variations in soil water content have been determined for a soil
   chronosequence in a sand dune system at Pinery Provincial Park,
   southwestern Ontario, Canada. Samples were obtained from seven soil
   profiles along a 250 m succession from unvegetated dunes to dunes
   partially stabilized by C-3 or C-4 grasses to stable dunes supporting an
   oak-savannah ecosystem. This location provided the opportunity to
   determine the relative influences of topography, vegetation and
   seasonality on the volumetric soil-water content under temperate-humid
   conditions.
   Despite frequent and abundant precipitation, the soils were well drained
   at all times. Nevertheless, the sands typically retained a fraction of
   older soil water even following large rain events. The presence and type
   of vegetation had the greatest influence on soil moisture contents, both
   within a given profile and along the transition from unvegetated to
   forested dunes. Relative to unvegetated soils, grass roots facilitated
   more rapid infiltration of precipitation into deeper soil layers. During
   the growing season, however, soils in both forested and grassy areas
   became depleted of moisture in the rooting zone. The greater moisture
   retention of the organic-rich A-horizon and shading resulted in higher
   water contents of the uppermost soil layer in forested areas despite
   interception of some precipitation by the oak canopy. During warm summer
   months, the competing effects of increased evapotranspiration and
   periodic wetting accentuated differences in soil moisture content among
   sites. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V All rights reserved.},

Year = {2016},
Volume = {7},

Abstract = {The agriculture sector is a major contributor towards global N2O
   (nitrous oxide) emissions. Amongst various factors controlling N2O
   emissions from cultivated fields, application of fertilizers and manures
   is the key factor. The effect of 42 years of continuous application of
   inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on N2O emissions in
   loamy sand soil was studied via closed chambers and gas chromatography.
   Daily N2O fluxes from five treatments: 100\% NPK (T-1), 150\% NPK (T-2),
   100\% N (T-3), 100\% NPK+ FYM(T-4) and Control (T-5), of an onging
   experiment under maize-wheat cropping system on Typic Ustochrept in
   Northern India, were measured during maize and wheat crop seasons. The
   average N2O fluxes in T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4 and T-5 treatments during maize
   crop season were 56.2, 60.8, 58.5, 59.2 and 24.6N(2)O-Ng ha(-1) day(-1),
   respectively and in thewheat crop season 17.1, 19.7, 17.2, 19.4 and 11.5
   N2O-N g ha(-1) day(-1), respectively. Total N2O emissions in long-term
   fertilizer or manure treatments were approximately 100 and 50\% higher
   than control in the maize and wheat crop seasons, respectively. Various
   long-term treatments had significant effect on status of various soils C
   and N forms, which in-turn influenced N2O emissions. Regression analysis
   revealed that water-input either from rainfall or irrigation controlled
   nearly 50\% of the seasonal variations in N2O fluxes in the control
   treatment and about 20\% variations in fertilizer and manure treatments.
   This suggested that in addition to irrigation or rainfall, fertilizer
   application also played an important role in N2O emissions. Although
   carbon-equivalent emissions were higher from balanced fertilization or
   FYM application treatments, yield-scaled global warming potentials (GWP)
   were lower due to higher maize and wheat grain yields in these
   treatments. Long-termmaize-wheat cropping without any nutrient
   application or imbalanced fertilization resulted in higher yield-scaled
   GWP. The findings suggested that to achieve food security and curtail
   N2O emissions, balanced fertilization or integrated nutrient management
   may be adopted. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Long Term Effects of Farming System on Soil Water Content and Dry Soil
   Layer in Deep Loess Profile of Loess Tableland in China},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {13},
Number = {6},

Abstract = {Soil water is strongly affected by land use/cover in the Loess Plateau
   in China. Water stored in thick loessal soils is one of the most
   important resources regulating vegetation growth. However, soil water in
   the deep loess profile, which is critical for maintaining the function
   of the ``soil water pool{''} is rarely studied because deep profile soil
   samples are difficult to collect. In this study, four experimental plots
   were established in 2005 to represent different farming systems on the
   Changwu Tableland: fallow land, fertilized cropland, unfertilized
   cropland, and continuous alfalfa. The soil water content in the
   15-m-deep loess profiles was monitored continuously from 2007 to 2012
   with the neutron probe technique. The results showed that temporal
   variations in soil water profiles differed among the four farming
   systems. Under fallow land, the soil water content increased gradually
   over time, first in the surface layers and later in the deep soil
   layers. In contrast, the soil water content decreased gradually under
   continuous alfalfa. The distributions of soil water in deep soil layers
   under both fertilized and unfertilized cropland were relatively stable
   overtime. Thus fanning system significantly affected soil water content.
   Seven years after the start of the experiment, the soil water contents
   in the 15-m-deep profiles averaged 23.4\% under fallow land, 20.3\%
   under fertilized cropland, 21.6\% under unfertilized cropland, and
   16.0\% under continuous alfalfa. Compared to measurements at the start
   of the experiment, both fallow land and unfertilized cropland increased
   soil water storage in the 15-m loess profiles. In contrast, continuous
   alfalfa reduced soil water storage. Fertilized cropland has no
   significant effect on soil water storage. These results suggest that
   deep soil water can be replenished under the fallow and unfertilized
   farming systems. Dry soil layers (i.e., those which have soil water
   content less than the stable field water capacity) in the subsoil of the
   Changwu Tableland region can be classified as either temporary dry soil
   layers or persistent dry soil layers. Temporary dry soil layers, which
   typically form under annual crops, often disappear during wet years.
   Persistent dry soil layers generally develop under perennial vegetation.
   Even after removing the vegetation, persistent dry soil layers remain
   for several decades. This study provides information useful for the
   conservation and utilization of soil water resources in the Loess
   Tableland.},

Abstract = {Farmers in Central India practice a unique rain water management system
   ('Haveli') based on impounding rain water in the fields during three
   months monsoon season (June-September) and draining out in October.
   Winter crops, mainly grain legumes are then grown that utilize the soil
   moisture conserved in the soil profile. We monitored the soil
   physico-chemical and fertility properties, C and N mineralization,
   microbial populations and biomass and soil enzymes in the 0-30 cm soil
   layer at ten sites over three years at four stages viz., prior to
   submergence in summer (PS), during water-logging (WL), after drainage
   (AD) and after legume cropping (AC). Anaerobic conditions during
   water-logging (for 11 weeks) led to extensive losses of soil carbon
   amounting to 1900 mg C kg(-1) soil but no significant change in soil N.
   Post-drainage and decomposition of weeds (for 6 weeks), there was an
   increase in soil C of 3700 mg C kg(-1) and soil N of 74.1 mg N kg(-1)
   soil. Overall in 17 weeks, there was a net increase of 1800 mg C kg(-1)
   (+30.5\%) and 87.5 mg N kg(-1) (+20.1\%) amounting to soil C and N
   accretion rate of 15.1 mg C kg(-1) soil day and 0.74 mg N kg(-1) soil
   day. Microbial biomass decreased by 19.7\% during 11 weeks of water
   logging and improved by 54\% in the 6 weeks aerobic phase; an overall
   increment of 23.5\% (31 mg microbial C kg(-1)) in 17 weeks. Prolonged
   water-logging induced severe stress on microbial processes. However,
   post-drainage, there was significant improvement in microbial
   populations, nitrogen mineralization, soil enzymes and soil fertility.
   There were strong relationships between soil enzymes and microbial
   carbon; and, nitrogen mineralization and soil carbon. Results
   unequivocally demonstrated the benefits of rain-water conservation in
   Vertisols for carbon sequestration and nitrogen accretion and
   improvement of soil biological quality. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Long-term effects of NPK fertiliser and manure on soil fertility and a
   sorghum-wheat farming system},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE},

Abstract = {Yield decline or stagnation under long-term cultivation and its
   relationship with soil organic matter fractions are rarely considered.
   To understand this phenomenon, soil organic matter fractions and soil
   aggregate size distribution were studied in a long-term experiment at
   Akola, in a Vertisol in a semiarid tropical environment. For 14 years,
   the following fertiliser treatments were compared with undisturbed
   fallow plots: unfertilised (control), 100\% recommended rates of N, NP,
   NPK (N: P: K ratios of 100: 21.8: 18.2 and 120: 26.2: 50 kg/ha for
   sorghum and wheat, respectively) and 100\% NPK plus farmyard manure
   (FYM) and continuous cropping with a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench)
   and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system during 1988-2001. The
   significant negative yield trend was observed in unbalanced use of
   inorganic N application for both crops. However, yields were maintained
   when NPK and NPK + FYM were applied. Results showed that soil organic C
   and total N in the unfertilised plot decreased by 21.7 and 18.2\%,
   compared to the initial value, at a depth of 0-15 cm. Depletion of large
   macroaggregates (> 2 mm) accounted for 22-81\% of the total mass of
   aggregates in N, NP and unfertilised control plots compared to fallow
   plots. Irrespective of treatments, small macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm)
   dominated aggregate size distribution (56-71\%), followed by
   microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm, 18-37\%). Active fractions, such as
   microbial biomass C, microbial biomass N, hot water soluble C and N, and
   acid hydrolysable carbohydrates were greater in NPK and NPK + FYM
   treatments than in the control. Carbon and N mineralisation were greater
   in small macroaggregates than microaggregates. Particulate organic
   matter C (POMC) and N (POMN) were significantly correlated (P < 0.01)
   with water-stable aggregate C and N (0.25-2 mm size classes),
   respectively. It was further observed that POMC and POMN were
   significantly greater in NPK and NPK + FYM plots than N and NP treated
   plots. Microbial biomass C was positively correlated with
   acid-hydrolysable carbohydrates (r = 0.79, P < 0.05). Continuous
   cropping and fertiliser use also influenced humic acid C and fulvic acid
   C fractions of the soil organic matter. Acid-hydrolysable N proportion
   in humic acid was greater than fulvic acid and it was greatest in NPK +
   FYM treatments. Continuous application of 100\% NPK + FYM could restore
   soil organic carbon (SOC) to a new equilibrium level much earlier (t =
   1/k, 2.4 years) than N (t = 1/k, 25.7 years), NP (t = 1/k, 8.1 years)
   and NPK (t = 1/k, 5.02 years). In conclusion, integrated use of NPK with
   FYM would be vital to obtain sustainable yields without deteriorating
   soil quality.},

Title = {TIME-DOMAIN AND FREQUENCY-DOMAIN REFLECTOMETRY TYPE SOIL MOISTURE SENSOR
   PERFORMANCE AND SOIL TEMPERATURE EFFECTS IN FINE- AND COARSE-TEXTURED
   SOILS},
Journal = {APPLIED ENGINEERING IN AGRICULTURE},

Pages = {117-134},
Abstract = {The performances of six time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and
   frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) type soil moisture sensors were
   investigated for measuring volumetric soil-water content (theta(nu)) in
   two different soil types. Soil-specific calibration equations were
   developed for each sensor using calibrated neutron probe-measured
   theta(nu.) Sensors were also investigated for their performance response
   in measuring theta(nu) to changes in soil temperature. The performance
   of all sensors was significantly different (P<0.05) than the neutron
   probe-measured theta(nu) with the same sensor also exhibiting variation
   between soils. In the silt loam soil, the 5TE sensor had the lowest root
   mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.041 m(3)/m(3), indicating the best
   performance among all sensors investigated. The performance ranking of
   the other sensors from high performance to low was: TDR300 (High Clay
   Mode), CS616 (H) and 10HS, SA4150, TDR300 (Standard Mode), and CS616 (V)
   (H: horizontal installation and V: vertical installation). In the loamy
   sand, the CS616 (H) performed best with an RMSE of 0.014 m(3)/m(3) and
   the performance ranking of other sensors was: 5TE, CS616 (V), TDR300
   (S), SA4150, and 10HS. When theta(nu) was near or above field capacity,
   the performance error of most sensors increased. Most sensors exhibited
   a linear response to increase in soil temperature. Most sensors
   exhibited substantial sensitivity to changes in soil temperature and the
   a response of the same sensor to high vs. normal soil temperatures
   differed significantly between the soils. All sensors underestimated
   theta(nu) in high temperature range in both soils. The ranking order of
   the magnitude of change in theta(nu) in response to 1 degrees C increase
   in soil temperature (from the lowest to the greatest impact of soil
   temperature on sensor performance) in silt loam soil was: SA4150, 5TE,
   TDR300 (S), 10HS, CS620, CS616 (H), and CS616 (V). The ranking order
   from lower to higher sensitivity to soil temperature changes in loamy
   sand was: 10HS, CS616 (H), 5TE, CS616 (V), SA4150, and TDR300 (S). When
   the data from all sensors and soils are pooled, the overall average of
   change in theta(nu) for a 1 degrees C increase in soil temperature was
   0.21 m(3)/m(3) in silt loam soil and -0.052 m(3)/m(3) in loamy sand.
   When all TDR- and FDR-type sensors were pooled separately for both
   soils, the average change in theta(nu) for a 1 degrees C increase in
   soil temperature for the TDR- and FDR-type sensors was 0.1918 and
   -0.0273 m(3)/m(3), respectively, indicating that overall TDR-type
   sensors are more sensitive to soil temperature changes than FDR-type
   sensors when measuring theta(nu).},

Abstract = {Tillage practices may affect the active fraction of soil organic N. As
   part of a national project to examine soil management and environmental
   controls on the active fraction of organic N, this study examined the
   effects of no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems on the
   quantity of potentially mineralizable soil N (N-0) and mineralizable N
   pools, and the potential to detect changes in these pools using N
   availability indices. Preplant soil samples from the top 15 cm were
   collected from four long-term tillage experiments at Swift Current, SK;
   Woodslee, ON; L'Acadie, QC; and Agassiz, BC. Potentially mineralizable N
   was determined by aerobic incubation at 25 degrees C and periodic
   leaching for 24 wk. The N-0 was greater under NT than under CT but only
   at Swift Current. The labile and intermediate mineralizable N pools were
   significantly higher under NT than under CT at three of the four sites.
   The stable mineralizable N pool and the mineralization rate coefficient
   (k) were greater under NT than under CT at only one of the four sites.
   Adoption of NT influenced the quality of the active organic N fraction
   at three sites, as indicated by an increased proportion of mineralizable
   N in the more labile N pools. Among tested indices of N availability,
   KCl-extractable NH4-N, NaOH-extractable N, Illinois Soil N Test,
   phosphate-borate buffer extractable N, and particulate organic C were
   most sensitive to tillage-induced changes in the active organic N
   fraction. Tillage-induced changes in the size and quality of the active
   organic N fraction may influence soil N supply and should be considered
   in optimizing fertilizer N management.},

Abstract = {The cosmic-ray method for measuring soil moisture, used in the
   Cosmic-Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), relies on the
   exceptional ability of hydrogen to moderate fast neutrons. Sources of
   hydrogen near the ground, other than soil moisture, affect the neutron
   measurement and therefore must be quantified. This study investigates
   the effect of atmospheric water vapor on the cosmic-ray probe signal and
   evaluates the fast neutron response in realistic atmospheric conditions
   using the neutron transport code Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended
   (MCNPX). The vertical height of influence of the sensor in the
   atmosphere varies between 412 and 265 m in dry and wet atmospheres,
   respectively. Model results show that atmospheric water vapor near the
   surface affects the neutron intensity signal by up to 12\%,
   corresponding to soil moisture differences on the order of 0.10 m(3)
   m(-3). A simple correction is defined to identify the true signal
   associated with integrated soil moisture that rescales the measured
   neutron intensity to that which would have been observed in the
   atmospheric conditions prevailing on the day of sensor calibration. Use
   of this approach is investigated with in situ observations at two sites
   characterized by strong seasonality in water vapor where standard
   meteorological measurements are readily available.},

Abstract = {Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made
   considerable progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this
   experiment, a closed loop control system based on the relationship of
   electrical resistance and soil moisture was used to test the performence
   of the automated drip irrigation system for pepper (Capsicum annuum L.)
   growth. A main strategy for irrigation was determined before irrigation
   events and the pot (100k Omega) in the circuit was adjusted to the
   strategy determined before, thereafter a signal was produced by the
   electrodes embedded in the substrate whenever soil moisture reached to
   the threshold level. Therefore, the system took over irrigation events,
   started and stopped the irrigations throughout the entire growing
   season. The irrigation times and amounts of irrigation water applied by
   the system was not suitable for uniform crop production, because
   irrigation throuhout the whole growing season was commenced as almost
   55\% of the available soil moisture was depleted from field capacity
   (FC).},

Abstract = {Precipitation analysis and soil moisture from the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System (GLDAS) are used to assess the land-atmosphere
   coupling in boreal summer. Correlations between antecedent soil moisture
   and precipitation suggest that regions of strong land-atmosphere
   coupling lie mainly in arid to semiarid transition zones or in semihumid
   forest to grassland transition zones. They consist of central Eurasia,
   the region from Mongolia to northern China, southwest China, the Sahel,
   the northern continental United States, and southern Europe. It is found
   that over these regions, positive soil moisture feedback accounts for
   typically 10-20\% of the variance of monthly precipitation anomalies
   with the feedback efficiency of the order of 0.3-0.9 mm month(-1) (0.1
   standardized soil moisture)(-1). While soil moisture feedback is
   dominated by the positive sign, negative feedback may exist in some
   areas, such as India and the western part and Quebec province of Canada.
   Generally, the land-atmosphere coupling strength estimated from the
   GLDAS data agrees well with those from the observational soil moisture
   in Illinois and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts
   40-year reanalysis (ERA-40) soil moisture product. Physical mechanisms
   responsible for the findings are further discussed. This study provides
   a Northern Hemisphere distribution of the land-atmosphere coupling
   strength, which can be used to test the model simulations on monthly to
   seasonal time scales.},

Abstract = {In recent years, continuous improvements have been made in weather
   forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from Early Warning
   Systems (EWSs). Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the
   scientific and user communities, EWSs remain based mostly on hazard
   forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential
   impacts is generally missing.
   In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment
   for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model
   ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the
   flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge
   probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a
   fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively
   assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved.
   The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in
   northwestern Italy. This paper discusses the potential challenges and
   opportunities offered by this approach in the decision-making workflow
   in an operational context.},

Abstract = {Very few frameworks exist that estimate global-scale soil moisture
   through microwave land data assimilation (DA). Toward this goal, such a
   framework has been developed by linking the Community Land Model,
   version 4 (CLM4), and a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) with
   the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic
   ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) within DART is utilized to
   estimate global multilayer soil moisture by assimilating brightness
   temperature observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer
   for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). A 40-member ensemble of Community
   Atmosphere Model, version 4.0 (CAM4.0), reanalysis is adopted to drive
   CLM4 simulations. Space-specific, time-invariant microwave parameters
   are precalibrated to minimize uncertainties in RTM. Besides, various
   methods are designed to upscale AMSR-E observations for computational
   efficiency and time shift CAM4.0 forcing to facilitate global daily
   assimilations. A series of experiments are conducted to quantify the DA
   sensitivity to microwave parameters, choice of assimilated observations,
   and different CLM4 updating schemes. Evaluation results indicate that
   the newly established CLM4-RTM-DART framework improves the open-loop
   CLM4-simulated soil moisture. Precalibrated microwave parameters, rather
   than their default values, can ensure a more robust global-scale
   performance. In addition, updating near-surface soil moisture is capable

Abstract = {Alley cropping is practiced to produce grain and forage crops, reduce
   soil and nutrient losses by surface runoff and improve nutrient
   availability. Growing barley and legumes for grain and forage in
   pistachio, olive and vineyards is a common alley cropping system applied
   in the southeastern Turkey. However, this practice is not being widely
   used by farmers because of their concern of that these forage crops
   severely compete the trees for water and nutrients. This study was
   therefore conducted to observe temporal variation in soil moisture
   content (SMC) under an alley cropping systems in pistachio to
   investigate the competition between main and secondary crops for SM in
   three alley cropping systems and to suggest the most proper alley crops
   to farmers in the region. The experiment was conducted in an orchard of
   20 year-old pistachio trees. There were no differences in SM content
   among the four treatments from beginning until April 19, 2009. However,
   the means were significantly different after this date (April 19, 2009).
   The soil moisture deficit (SMD) calculated was 27.4 mm for control
   compared to 45.1 mm for alley cropped treatments. Even though there were
   no significant differences in SMC among the treatments during the whole
   experimental period, the effect of treatments on the yield or other
   physiological characteristics of pistachio trees needs investigating for
   a sound decision on the selection of the best alley cropping system. (C)

Abstract = {In situ soil moisture monitoring networks are critical to the
   development of soil moisture remote sensing missions as well as
   agricultural and environmental management, weather forecasting, and many
   other endeavors. These in situ networks utilize a variety of sensors and
   installation practices, which confounds the development of a unified
   reference database for satellite calibration and validation programs. As
   part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission, the Marena, Oklahoma,
   In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST) was initiated to perform
   inter-comparisons and study sensor limitations. Soil moisture sensors
   that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the
   study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray
   Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed
   temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers
   (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil
   moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four
   stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600
   m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The
   sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens
   Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM,
   Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system.
   In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain
   reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was
   necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an
   RMSE below 0.04 m(3) m(-3). For most sensor types, a single near surface
   sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain
   by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0.03 m(3)
   m(-3).},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture with spatial and temporal distribution is in
   big demand in arid and semi-arid regions. In Loess Plateau in China,
   where soil erosion is a major issue, information about soil water
   content helps in the planning of regional water resources and vegetation
   restoration for the prevention of erosion. In this study, we have
   developed the SWEST (soil water estimation from surface temperature)
   method by integrating well-known relationships among surface
   temperature, evapotranspiration and soil water content. An advantage of
   the proposed SWEST method is that it can estimate soil water content for
   the location of a water source of evapotranspiration, where there would
   be a near-surface for bare soil and the root zone for well vegetated
   surfaces. A verification study conducted at Liudaogou River Basin of the
   Loess Plateau, China, indicated the method could estimate soil water
   content accurately, with an estimation error of about 2.6\% of the total
   volume of soil. Application of the method to satellite thermal imaging
   successfully presented the applicability of the SWEST method to estimate
   soil water content with spatial and temporal variability. (C) 2012

Abstract = {Rational soil phosphorus (P) management is significant to crop
   production and environment protection. Little information is available
   on soil Olsen-P balance and critical values in double-crop rice in
   China. The main aim of the study was to relate soil Olsen-P to apparent
   P balance and to determine Olsen-P critical value for early and late
   rice using data from a 29-year study (1984-2012) at the Jiangxi
   province. The results showed that Olsen-P decreased by 0.12-0.26
   mg/kg/year without P addition and increased by 0.56-2.52 mg/kg/year with
   P fertilization. Olsen-P decreased by 0.30 mg/kg for CK and NK under an
   average deficit of 100 kg P/ha, and increased by an average of 9.10
   mg/kg in treatments with organic manures and were 4.55 times higher than
   chemical fertilizers with 100 kg/ha of P surplus. The critical values
   for early and late rice were 22.70 and 22.67 mg/kg, respectively. The
   average Olsen-P content is 90.89 mg/kg after 29-year application of
   chemical fertilizer and manures. Therefore, decreasing the amount of
   total P input and increasing the compost portion should be recommended
   to improve food production and protect environment in red paddy soils in
   south China.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT},

Pages = {2479-2485},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Rural areas represent approximately 95\% of the 14000 km(2) Alabama
   Black Belt, an area of widespread Vertisols dominated by clayey,
   smectitic, shrink-swell soils. These soils are unsuitable for
   conventional onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) which are
   nevertheless widely used in this region. In order to provide an
   alternative wastewater dosing system, an experimental field moisture
   controlled subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system was designed and
   installed as a field trial. The experimental system that integrates a
   seasonal cropping system was evaluated for two years on a 500-m(2)
   Houston clay site in west central Alabama from August 2006 to June 2008.
   The SDI system was designed to start hydraulic dosing only when field
   moisture was below field capacity. Hydraulic dosing rates fluctuated as
   expected with higher dosing rates during warm seasons with near zero or
   zero dosing rates during cold seasons. Lower hydraulic dosing in winter
   creates the need for at least a two-month waste storage structure which
   is an insurmountable challenge for rural homeowners. An estimated 30\%
   of dosed water percolated below 45-cm depth during the first summer
   which included a 30-year historic drought. This massive volume of
   percolation was presumably the result of preferential flow stimulated by
   dry weather clay soil cracking. Although water percolation is necessary
   for OWTS, this massive water percolation loss indicated that this
   experimental system is not able to effective control soil moisture
   within its monitoring zone as designed. Overall findings of this study
   indicated that soil moisture controlled SDI wastewater dosing is not
   suitable as a standalone system in these Vertisols. However, the
   experimental soil moisture control system functioned as designed,
   demonstrating that soil moisture controlled SDI wastewater dosing may
   find application as a supplement to other wastewater disposal methods
   that can function during cold seasons. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) currently
   prepares the assimilation of soil moisture data derived from advanced
   scatterometer (ASCAT) measurements. ASCAT is part of the MetOp satellite
   payload launched in November 2006 and will ensure the operational
   provision of soil moisture information until at least 2020. Several
   studies showed that soil moisture derived from scatterometer data
   contain skillful information. Based on data from its predecessor
   instruments, the ERS-1/2 scatterometers we examine the potential of
   future ASCAT soil moisture data for numerical weather prediction (NWP).
   In a first step, we compare nine years of the ERS scatterometer derived
   surface soil moisture index (Theta(S)) against soil moisture from the
   ECMWF re-analysis (ERA40) data set (Theta(E)) to (i) identify systematic
   differences and (ii) derive a transfer function which minimises these
   differences and transforms Theta(S) into model equivalent volumetric
   soil moisture Theta(S){*}. We then use a nudging scheme to assimilate
   Theta(S){*} in the soil moisture analysis of the ECMWF numerical weather
   prediction model. In this scheme the difference between Theta(S){*} and
   the model first guess Theta(FG), calculated at 1200 UTC, is added in 1/4
   fractions throughout a 24 h window to the model resulting in analysed
   soil moisture Theta(NDG). We compare results from this experiment
   against those from a control experiment where soil moisture evolved
   freely and against those from the operational ECMWF forecast system,
   which uses an optimum interpolation scheme to analyse soil moisture.
   Validation against field observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet, shows
   that the assimilation of Theta(S){*} increases the correlation from 0.39
   to 0.66 and decreases the RMSE from 0.055 m(3) m(-3) to 0.041 m(3) m(-3)
   compared against the control experiment. The corresponding forecasts for
   low level temperature and humidity improve only Marginally compared to
   the control experiment and deteriorate compared to the operational
   system. In addition, the results suggest that an advanced data
   assimilation system, like the Extended Kalman Filter, could use the
   satellite observations more effectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All

Volume = {30},

Abstract = {The objective of this study is to incorporate a time-dependent Soil
   Moisture Accounting (SMA) based Curve Number method (SMA\_CN) in Soil
   and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and compare its performance with the
   existing CN method in SWAT by simulating the hydrology of two
   agricultural watersheds in Indiana, USA. Results show that fusion of the
   SMA\_CN method causes decrease in runoff volume and increase in profile
   soil moisture content, associated with larger groundwater contribution
   to the streamflow. In addition, the higher amount of moisture in the
   soil profile slightly elevates the actual evapotranspiration. The
   SMA-based SWAT configuration consistently produces improved
   goodness-of-fit scores and less uncertain outputs with respect to
   streamflow during both calibration and validation. The SMA\_CN method
   exhibits a better match with the observed data for all flow regimes,
   thereby addressing issues related to peak and low flow predictions by
   SWAT in many past studies. Comparison of the calibrated model outputs
   with field-scale soil moisture observations reveals that the SMA
   overhauling enables SWAT to represent soil moisture condition more
   accurately, with better response to the incident rainfall dynamics.
   While the results from the modification of the CN method in SWAT are
   promising, more studies including watersheds with various physical and
   climatic settings are needed to validate the proposed approach.

Volume = {54},

Abstract = {The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a
   persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at
   distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data
   processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration.
   While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed
   sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At
   this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an
   established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture
   over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to
   biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)remote
   sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is
   limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation
   parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of
   these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of
   soil moisture within a 55-km(2) Alpine foothill river catchment in
   Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought
   into synergy for a 9-ha grassland and several other locations within the
   catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide
   valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize
   the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm.
   The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar
   soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29
   with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network
   optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was
   improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter
   product as a biomass water proxy.},

Title = {Nonstationarity of the electrical resistivity and soil moisture
   relationship in a heterogeneous soil system: a case study},
Journal = {SOIL},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {2},
Number = {2},
Pages = {241-255},
Abstract = {Understanding the role of vegetation in the interface between the
   atmosphere and groundwater is the most decisive key in analyzing the
   processes involved in water transfer. The main effect of vegetation is
   its root water uptake, which significantly modifies the processes
   involved in water transfer in the vadose zone. This paper focuses on
   mapping temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture using electrical
   resistivity tomography (ERT). The main objective is to assess how
   electrical resistivity (ER) is useful for mapping water distribution
   along a heterogeneous toposequence crossed by a hedgerow. Ten ERT were
   performed over the studied period for a 28m long toposequence and
   compared to matric potential and groundwater level measurements. Soil
   volumetric water content (VWC) was predicted with two methods: (i) from
   ER using the Waxman and Smits model (ii) and from matric potential using
   an experimental retention curve fitted by a Van Genuchten model.
   Probability density functions (PDFs) of our set of data show that the
   largest change in mean ER and matric potential was observed in the
   topsoil layer. We then analyzed the consistency between ER and point
   measurements in this layer by extracting the arrays at the junction of
   ER grids and point measurements. PDFs of ER maps at each monitoring time
   (from T01 to T10) were also calculated to select the most contrasting
   distributions, corresponding to the wettest (T06) and driest states
   (T10). Results of ER were consistent with matric-potential measurements,
   with two different behaviors for locations inside and outside the root
   zone. A consistent correlation between VWC values from the Waxman and
   Smits model and those obtained from the retention curve was observed
   outside the root zone. The heterogeneous soil system inside the root
   zone shows a different pattern in this relationship. A shift in the
   relationship between ER and soil moisture for the locations outside and
   inside the root zone highlights the nonstationarity between wet and dry
   periods inside the root zone. The equivocal behavior of this
   relationship shows the limitation of using ER to predict soil moisture
   in a heterogeneous soil system. Such systems were actually related to
   the high hedgerow root density and also to a particular topographical
   context (ditch and bank) that is encountered in Brittany and throughout
   northwestern Europe.},

Abstract = {The Soil Conservation Service curve number (CN) method commonly uses
   three discrete levels of soil antecedent moisture condition (AMC),
   defined by the 5-day antecedent rainfall depth, to describe soil
   moisture prior to a runoff event. However, this way may not adequately
   represent soil water conditions of fields and watersheds in the Loess
   Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine
   the effective soil moisture depth to which the CN is most related, (2)
   to evaluate a discrete and a linear relationship between AMC and soil
   moisture; and (3) to develop an equation between CN and Soil moisture to
   predict runoff better for the climatic and soil conditions of the Loess
   Plateau of China. The dataset consisted of 10 years of rainfall, runoff
   and soil moisture measurements from four experimental plots cropped with
   millet, pasture and potatoes. Results indicate that the standard CN
   method underestimated runoff depths for 85 of the 98 observed
   plot-runoff events, with a model efficiency E of only 0.243. For our
   experimental conditions, the discrete and linear approaches improved
   runoff estimation, but still underestimated most runoff events, with E
   values of 0.428 and 0.445 respectively. Based on the measured CN values
   and soil moisture values in the top 15 cm of the soil, a non-linear
   equation was developed that predicted runoff better with an E value of
   0.779. This modified CN equation was the most appropriate for runoff
   prediction in the study area, but may need adjustments for local
   conditions in the Loess Plateau of China. Copyright (c) 2006 John Wiley

Abstract = {Ecological restoration of high-quality, semi-natural communities of
   conservation value on ex-arable soils with raised fertility has been a
   major problem in northern Europe. One suggested way of tackling this
   problem is to use Full-Inversion Tillage (FIT) where the fertile
   top-soil is moved below infertile subsurface layers. This should provide
   infertile conditions at least in the short- to medium-term for the
   establishment of communities that require these conditions. Here, we
   pioneer a rigorous test of the efficacy of this approach. Our new
   method, using Principal Response Curves (PRCs), overcomes the difficulty
   in testing for change in soil physico-chemical properties down soil
   profiles with the inherent problem of autocorrelations between soil
   layers. Principal Response Curves (PRCs) is a multivariate technique,
   usually used to test for effects of treatment effects through time on a
   community matrix. We propose an extension of their use for the
   multivariate analysis of properties down a soil-depth profile. We tested
   the effects of FIT in two contrasting soils, before and after treatment.
   In a clay loam soil, FIT was effective in reducing the soil fertility in
   the surface 12 cm. Indeed the soil available P concentration, a key
   variable, was more than halved in the surface layers, and was below the
   lowest literature target threshold for the establishment of semi-natural
   grassland. In contrast, in the sandy soil, soil properties increased
   throughout the profile after FIT, primarily because of the pre-treatment
   nutrient distribution within the soil. Before FIT treatment, the maximum
   concentrations of most measured variables were at mid-depth and FIT
   redistributed these to the surface and bottom layers. Our results
   demonstrate the potential for FIT in ecological restoration, but
   indicate that its efficacy depends on soil type and the site history. We
   recommend that in future a pre-treatment assessment of soil properties
   with depth is undertaken before FIT is implemented, and that afterwards
   our PRC approach can be used to test efficacy immediately after
   treatment, and has the potential for measuring soil resilience to
   perturbation through time. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Moisture Estimation and Other Environmental Science Applications},
Journal = {VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {16},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Since the introduction of the cosmic-ray neutron method for soil
   moisture estimation, numerous studies have been conducted to test and
   advance the accuracy of the method. Almost 200 stationary neutron
   detector systems have been installed worldwide, and roving systems have
   also started to gain ground. The intensity of low-energy neutrons
   produced by cosmic rays, measured above the ground surface, is sensitive
   to soil moisture in the upper decimeters of the ground within a radius
   of hectometers. The method has been proven suitable for estimating soil
   moisture for a wide range of land covers and soil types and has been
   used for hydrological modeling, data assimilation, and calibration and
   validation of satellite products. The method is challenged by the effect
   on neutron intensity of other hydrogen pools such as vegetation, canopy
   interception, and snow. Identifying the signal of the different pools
   can be used to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture method as
   well as extend the application to, e.g., biomass and canopy interception
   surveying. More fundamental research is required for advancement of the
   method to include more energy ranges and consider multiple height
   levels.},

Abstract = {The surface temperature and vegetation index (Ts/VI) method is a remote
   sensing-based quantitative approach. It is widely used for estimating
   the evapotranspiration, evaporative fraction, and surface soil moisture
   (SSM). However, this method can only be used in flat regions. In this
   study, we investigated the effect of altitude when using the Ts/VI
   method for estimating the SSM in heterogeneous regions. The results
   showed that the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) method
   performed poorly at estimating the SSM in the source region of the
   Yangtze River; there was a weak correlation with the observed SSM, and
   R-2 was only 0.167. However, the performance of the method improved
   considerably when the effects of both altitude and frozen soil were
   considered; the TVDI had a strong correlation with the observed SSM, and
   R-2 improved to 0.617. In the study area, the effects of altitude on the
   TVDI values were greater than those of the frozen soil. In general, the
   Ts/VI method can obtain satisfactory results in mountainous regions if
   the effects of both the altitude and frozen soil are considered.},

Abstract = {Accurate measurement of soil moisture (theta), bulk electrical
   conductivity (sigma(b)), and porewater electrical conductivity
   (sigma(w)) in the vadose zone is critical for a wide range of
   environmental monitoring applications. The use of combined dielectric
   probes allows for the automated collection of high-resolution, long-term
   data, however variation in probe response to different soil types can
   lead to unacceptably large measurement errors, especially in soils with
   high organic content such as those found in wetlands. The objectives of
   this study were to calibrate and field-test a combined,
   capacitance-based dielectric probe for three soil series encountered in
   the floodplain of a southeastern (USA) coastal river where watershed
   modifications have led to reduced freshwater flow and saltwater
   intrusion. To calibrate the probe, floodplain soils were categorized
   into three groups: a low organic content fine sand; a moderately
   organic, depositional fluvent soil; and a highly organic muck. PVC soil
   cores were packed at field bulk density, and theta and sigma(b) were
   measured in the lab over a range of soil moistures (pressure potentials
   of 0-333 cm H2O) and sigma(w) values (0.01-1.0 S/m). Soil dielectric
   properties measured with the probe were used to test several potential
   models relating real and imaginary dielectric constants to theta,
   sigma(b), and sigma(w). Soil-specific calibrations improved theta
   estimation over standard manufacturer calibrations, particularly for the
   more organic soils. Of all theta-sigma(b)-sigma(w) models tested, the
   empirical relationship proposed by Vogeler et al. (1996) performed the
   best (overall R-2=0.97 for the three soils), though all models performed
   well in all soils (0.94 <= R-2 <= 0.98) and each can be selected for the
   specific range of sigma(b) expected in the field. Calibrations were
   successfully tested in the field by comparing in-ground probe estimates
   of sigma(w) with collocated soil water samples. These calibrations add
   to the limited published data available for soils of high organic
   content and support accurate monitoring of the vadose zone in coastal
   wetlands to inform restoration and management of these valued
   ecosystems. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A downscaling method for the near-surface soil moisture retrieved from
   passive microwave sensors is applied to the PBMR data collected during
   the Monsoon `90 experiment. The downscaling method requires (1) the
   coarse resolution microwave observations, (2) the fine-scale
   distribution of soil temperature and (3) the fine-scale distribution of
   surface conditions composed of atmospheric forcing and the parameters
   involved in the modeling of land surface-atmosphere interactions. During
   the Monsoon `90 experiment, eight ground-based meteorological and flux
   stations were operating over the 150km(2) study area simultaneously with
   the acquisition of the aircraft-based L-band PBMR data. The
   heterogeneous scene is hence composed of eight subpixels and the
   microwave pixel is generated by aggregating the microwave emission of
   all sites. The results indicate a good agreement between the downscaled
   and ground-based soil moisture as long as the intensity of solar
   radiation is sufficiently high to use the soil temperature as a tracer
   of the spatial variability of near-surface soil moisture. (c) 2006

Title = {Phosphorus transformations as a function of pedogenesis: A synthesis of
   soil phosphorus data using Hedley fractionation method},
Journal = {BIOGEOSCIENCES},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Pages = {2907-2916},
Abstract = {In spite of the importance of phosphorus (P) as a limiting nutrient in
   terrestrial ecosystems, our understanding of terrestrial P dynamics and
   our ability to model P cycling are hampered by the lack of consistent
   measurements of soil P. The Hedley fractionation method provides a
   comprehensive assessment of soil P and has been widely used in recent
   decades. Here we expand an earlier study that summarized Hedley P data
   from the literature to create a larger Hedley P database and further
   investigate the relationships between distributions of different forms
   of P and the stages of soil development. Our expanded Hedley P database
   generally supports what the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model
   predicts: the gradual decrease and eventual depletion of primary mineral
   P (mainly apatite P); the continual increase and eventual dominance of
   occluded P; and the overall decrease of total P during soil development.
   However the analysis disagrees with Walker and Syers (1976) in that we
   found labile inorganic P(Pi) and secondary mineral Pi (non-occluded P in
   Walker and Syers' model) to be a significant fraction of total P
   throughout all soil orders with different weathering stages. By
   analyzing the Hedley-labile P and vegetation P demand, we found that the
   amount of labile P is much greater than vegetation demand, even in
   highly weathered soils commonly considered P limited. We conclude that
   labile P measured by Hedley fractionation method should not be defined
   as plant available P since most of this labile P likely ends up as
   immobilized by microbes. Our analysis of the database also shows that
   carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil organic matter are closely linked in
   all soil orders, but P is decoupled from C and N in highly weathered
   soils with larger variations of nitrogen: organic P (N:Po) ratio and
   higher mean values of N: Po ratio, compared to slightly and
   intermediately weathered soils.},

Abstract = {This paper deals with the tuning of the free parameters of the Support
   Vector Regression technique used for the retrieval of geo/bio-physical
   variables from remotely sensed data. We propose to address this task in
   the framework of the multi-objective optimization. A multi-objective
   function is defined based on a set of two (or more) metrics (e. g., mean
   squared error MSE and determination coefficient R-2) that quantify from
   different (and sometimes competing) perspectives the goodness of a given
   parameter configuration. Then the metrics are jointly optimized
   according to the concept of Pareto optimality. This allows preserving
   the meaning of each metric and deriving multiple optimal solutions to
   the tuning problem. Each solution leads to a different optimal trade-off
   among the considered metrics. The main advantages of the proposed
   multi-objective parameter optimization approach with respect to
   traditional mono-objective strategies are: 1) the intrinsic improved
   robustness and efficiency, since multiple metrics are jointly exploited
   in the tuning of the free parameters of the considered regression
   method; and 2) the possibility to select the parameter configuration
   that leads to the desired trade-off among different criteria and thus
   best meets both the application constraints and the requirements of the
   specific estimation problem. The experimental analysis was focused on
   the challenging application domain of soil moisture retrieval from
   microwave remotely sensed data. The results obtained on data sets
   associated with two different operative conditions are very promising
   and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with
   more traditional tuning strategies based on a single metric and its
   usefulness in defining estimation systems for real application domains.},

Abstract = {Soil erosion processes in vineyards, beyond surface runoff and sediment
   transport, have a strong effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and
   redistribution along the slope. Variation in SOC across the landscape
   can determine differences in soil fertility and vine vigor. The goal of
   this research was to analyze the interactions among vines vigor,
   sediment delivery and SOC in a sloping vineyard located in Sicily. Six
   pedons were studied along the slope by digging 6 pits up to 60 cm depth.
   Soil was sampled every 10 cm and SOC, water extractable organic carbon
   (WEOC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were analyzed. Erosion
   rates, detachment and deposition areas were measured by the pole height
   method which allowed mapping of the soil redistribution. The vigor of
   vegetation, expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI),
   derived from high-resolution satellite multispectral data, was compared
   with measured pruning weight. Results confirmed that soil erosion,
   sediment redistribution and SOC across the slope was strongly affected
   by topographic features, slope and curvature. The erosion rate was 16Mg
   ha(-1) y(-1) since the time of planting (6 years). SOC redistribution
   was strongly correlated with the detachment or deposition areas as
   highlighted by pole height measurements. The off-farm SOC loss over six
   years amounted to 1.2 Mg C ha(-1). SUVA(254) values, which indicate
   hydrophobic material rich in aromatic constituents of WEOC, decreased
   significantly along the slope, demonstrating that WEOC in the detachment
   site is more stable in comparison to deposition sites. The plant vigor
   was strongly correlated with WEOC constituents. Results demonstrated
   that high resolution passive remote sensing data combined with soil and
   plant analyses can survey areas with contrasting SOC, soil fertility,
   soil erosion and plant vigor. This will allow monitoring of soil erosion
   and degradation risk areas and support decision-makers in developing
   measures for friendly environmental management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Title = {Extending the SCOPE model to combine optical reflectance and soil
   moisture observations for remote sensing of ecosystem functioning under
   water stress conditions},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {221},
Pages = {286-301},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A radiative transfer and process-based model, called
   Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE),
   relates remote sensing signals with plant functioning (i.e.,
   photosynthesis and evapotranspiration). Relying on optical remote
   sensing data, the SCOPE model estimates photosynthesis and
   evapotranspiration, but these ecosystem-level fluxes may be
   significantly overestimated if water availability is the primary
   limiting factor for vegetation. Remedying this shortcoming, additional
   information from extra sources is needed. In this study, we propose
   considering water stress in SCOPE by incorporating soil moisture data in
   the model, besides using satellite optical reflectance observations. A
   functional link between soil moisture, soil surface resistance, leaf
   water potential and carboxylation capacity is introduced as an extra
   element in SCOPE, resulting in a soil moisture integrated version of the
   model, SCOPE-SM. The modified model simulates additional state
   variables: (i) vapor pressure (e(i)), both in the soil pore space and
   leaf stomata in equilibrium with liquid water potential; (ii) the
   maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) by a soil moisture dependent
   stress factor; and (iii) the soil surface resistance (r(ss)) through
   approximation by a soil moisture dependent hydraulic conductivity. The
   new approach was evaluated at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) with dominant C3
   grasses and covering a wet-to-dry episode from January to August 2004.
   By using the original SCOPE (version 1.61), we simulated half-hourly
   time steps of plant functioning via locally measured weather data and
   time series of Landsat (TM and ETM) imagery. Then, SCOPE-SM was
   similarly applied to simulate plant functioning for three cases using
   Landsat imagery: (i) with modeled e(i); (ii) with modeled ei and V-cmax;
   and (iii) with modeled e(i) V-cmax and r(ss). The outputs of all four
   simulations were compared to flux tower plant functioning measurements.
   The results indicate a significant improvement proceeding from the first
   to the fourth case in which we used both Landsat optical imagery and
   soil moisture data through SCOPE-SM. Our results show that the combined
   use of optical reflectance and soil moisture observations has great
   potential to capture variations of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration
   during drought episodes. Further, we found that the information
   contained in soil moisture observations can describe more variations of
   measured evapotranspiration compared to the information contained in
   thermal observations.},

Abstract = {The change pattern and trend of soil moisture (SM) in the Wuding River
   basin, Loess Plateau, China is explored based on the simulated long-term
   SM data from 1956 to 2004 using an eco-hydrological process-based model,
   Vegetation Interface Processes model, VIP. In-situ SM observations
   together with a remotely sensed SM dataset retrieved by the Vienna
   University of Technology are used to validate the model. In the VIP
   model, climate-eco-hydrological (CEH) variables such as precipitation,
   air temperature and runoff observations and also simulated
   evapotranspiration (E-T), leaf area index (LAI), and vegetation
   production are used to analyze the soil moisture evolution mechanism.
   The results show that the model is able to capture seasonal SM
   variations. The seasonal pattern, multi-year variation, standard
   deviation and coefficient of variation (C-V) of SM at the daily, monthly
   and annual scale are well explained by CEH variables. The annual and
   inter-annual variability of SM is the lowest compared with that of other
   CEH variables. The trend analysis shows that SM is in decreasing
   tendency at alpha=0.01 level of significance, confirming the Northern
   Drying phenomenon. This trend can be well explained by the decreasing
   tendency of precipitation (alpha=0.1) and increasing tendency of
   temperature (alpha=0.01). The decreasing tendency of runoff has higher
   significance level (alpha=0.001). Because of SM's decreasing tendency,
   soil evaporation (E-S) is also decreasing (alpha=0.05). The tendency of
   net radiation (R-n), evapotranspiration (E-T), transpiration (E-C),
   canopy intercept (E-I) is not obvious. Net primary productivity (NPP),
   of which the significance level is lower than alpha=0.1, and gross
   primary productivity (GPP) at alpha=0.01 are in increasing tendency.},

Abstract = {The Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and the Global Positioning
   System (GPS) were the two geospatial technologies used in a precision
   soil fertility investigation of a thirty five hectare farmland for
   arable crop production in Akure (7 degrees 15'N, 5 degrees 15'E),
   Nigeria. The research was carried out from January to May 2008. The
   latitude and longitude of the farmland were taken with the global
   position system receiver and the data input into the computer system.
   ArcView 3.3 software programme was used to generate the boundary of the
   farmland from the coordinates while the topographic and slope maps were
   generated with the elevation data. The soil fertility investigation was
   carried out by locating sampling pits for soil samples collection on the
   basis of soil slope relationship for which the entire landscape was
   categorized into two slope types of 0.5 to 8\% and 8 to 15\%. Soil
   samples were collected at surface (0-30 cm) and subsoil (30-100 cm)
   across the slopes for the soil physical and chemical properties. The
   average values of soil data were computed using ArcView statistical
   analysis tools. The results of analysis showed the soil to be sandy loam
   in the surface and sandy clay loam in the subsoil. The gravel content
   was higher in the subsoil compared to surface soil and the soil which
   was slightly acidic to neutral had higher organic matter, total
   exchangeable bases and cation exchange capacity in the surface soil
   compared to the subsoil. The soil fertility was adjudged to be of
   moderate productivity and found suitable for arable crop production but
   can only be sustained with addition of organic and inorganic fertilizers
   in a continuous cropping over the years. The application of geospatial
   technologies had generated a digital map of the farmland to make
   possible a periodic review of the fertility status.},

   the Qilian Mountains},
Journal = {CATENA},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {129},
Pages = {63-75},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Hydrological service by soil under mountain ecosystems is a hot topic in
   current ecological research. We monitored the precipitation and soil
   moisture dynamics and measured the soil hydrological parameters of
   grassland and forest ecosystems along an elevation gradient in the
   Dayekou catchment of the central Qilian Mountains in northwestern China.
   Soil moisture dynamics in response to rainfall events exhibit different
   characteristics with different ecosystems and at different elevations.
   The soil conditions (including soil texture, soil structure, and soil
   hydrological parameters), the local meteorological condition, and the
   physiological characteristics of the vegetation can help explain
   eco-hydrological differences. The total rainfall increased with an
   increase in elevation across the rainy season. Soil moisture content
   increased with an increase in altitude and differs with land cover on
   average values. Grassland and forest at low elevations have 50\% and
   41.7\% of the soil moisture content level under shrubland at high
   elevations, and Qinghai spruce forest soil has the greatest ``green
   water (the water used mainly by the ecosystem itself){''} capacity.
   Fluctuation in soil moisture diminishes with increased depth, yet the
   trend is not obvious under shrubland at high elevations. The sensitivity
   of soil moisture response to rainfall differed depending on land cover
   and soil depth. Soil moisture under alpine shrubland is far more
   sensitive to single rainfall events, whereas other land-cover types
   display only typical responses in periods of frequent rainfall events
   (continued-rainfall scale). The study of soil moisture dynamics
   contributes to research on hydrological service in mountain ecosystems,
   and is helpful in promoting knowledge innovation regarding the
   relationship between water and ecosystems. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {The influence of water, land, energy and soil-nutrient resource
   interactions on the food system in Uganda},
Journal = {FOOD POLICY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {51},
Pages = {24-37},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Food Security continues to be elusive in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA),
   several decades after the first World Food Summit in 1974. The causes of
   food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa include among others; poverty,
   economic constraints, agricultural and agronomical challenges, rapid
   population growth, and the effects of adverse climate change. These
   causes however, are linked to complex interactions, constraints and
   dependencies amongst the key physical resources in food systems, namely
   - Water, Land, Energy and Soil Nutrients (WLEN). There is limited
   insight on the combined impacts of the resource nexus, and how this may
   constrain the performance of food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. This
   understanding is essential if the food challenges in the region are to
   be tackled sustainably.
   This study provides a detailed analysis of the Uganda's 2012 WLEN nexus
   resources vis-a-vis the country's current and potential food demand
   using calorific-demand analysis and source-to-service resource
   transformation modelling. The analysis determines estimates of the
   current resource stresses within Uganda's insufficient food system and
   the interconnected resource implications for the achievement of food
   security by 2050. The results are visualised using Sankey diagrams. The
   inferences highlight evident limits across all four resources. Overall,
   the analysis helps to inform food security policy and the resource
   context for the present and future management of Uganda's food system.

   validation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2015},

Abstract = {This paper examines near-surface soil moisture data (top similar to 6
   cm) from an Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) monitoring network
   in southern Manitoba, Canada, over the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons.
   This network is intended for use (in part) as a core validation site for
   the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The network currently
   consists of 9 stations sited within agricultural fields. Each station
   uses a triplicate configuration of horizontally installed Hydra Probe
   soil moisture sensors at near-surface (similar to 5 an) to root-zone
   soil depths, in addition to permanently installed vertical surface
   sensors (0-5.7 cm). This domain was studied intensively over the 6.5
   week SMAPVEX12 ground campaign in June/July 2012, providing coincident
   soil moisture datasets to assess network up-scaling over the domain.
   Results demonstrate that statistical differences exist between the
   network-level data from the horizontal (theta(3.5-6.5cm)) and vertical
   (theta(0-5.7cm)) surface Hydra Probes over 2012-13. Bootstrap resampling
   shows that a mean difference of 0.018 m(3) m(-3) (at 99\% confidence) is
   observed between theta(3.5-6.5cm) and theta(0-5.7cm) measurement depths
   (theta(0-5.7cm) sensors exhibit dry bias). Individual station analysis
   shows that the largest differences between theta(3.5-6.5cm) and
   theta(0-5.7cm) measurement depth occur at sites with higher clay
   content, whereas sensors located in sandy soils exhibit negligible
   differences. Up-scaling comparisons of the AAFC network to field-sampled
   data and a dense temporary network over SMAPVEX12 demonstrate that it is
   representative of the domain within 0.04 m(3) m(-3) RMSE. This suggests
   that the AAFC network is suitable for coarse resolution L-band microwave
   soil moisture validation. Comparison of Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity
   (SMOS) Level 2 soil moisture product data to the up-scaled AAFC network
   data over 2012-13 shows that superior temporal correlation is found with
   the theta(0-5.7cm) dataset. The difference in RMSEs between the SMOS
   comparisons to theta(3.5-6.5cm) and theta(0-5.7cm) network datasets is
   approximately 0.018 m(3) m(-3). These results suggest that differences
   of near-surface measurement depth and sensor configuration should be
   considered when conducting L-band satellite validation. (C) 2014

Abstract = {A component of designing a managed aquifer recharge system in a dune
   aquifer is the control of diffusive evaporative loss of water which is
   governed by the physical properties of the sediments and the position of
   the water table. A critical water table position is the extinction
   depth, below which no further loss of water occurs via diffusion. Field
   experiments were conducted to measure the extinction depth of sediments
   taken from a typical dune field in the region. The soil grain size
   characteristics, laboratory porosity, and saturated hydraulic
   conductivity were measured. The sand is classified as well-sorted, very
   fine sand with a mean grain diameter of 0.15 mm. Soil moisture gradients
   and diffusion loss rates were measured using sensors in a non-weighing
   lysimeter that was placed below land surface. The sand was saturated
   carefully with water from the bottom to the top and was exposed to the
   natural climate for a period of about two months. The moisture gradient
   showed a gradual decline during measurement until extinction depth was
   reached at about 100 cm below surface after 56 days. Diurnal temperature
   changes were observed in the upper 75 cm of the column and were
   negligible at greater depth.},

   Microwave Imager (SSM/I) were utilized to derive Soil Moisture Use
   Efficiency (SMUE). SMUE, serving here as a proxy for the commonly used
   Water Use Efficiency (WUE), was used to evaluate drought vulnerability
   (i.e., the degree of drought stress and sensitivity) in the Northeast
   Asia drylands for the period of 1987-2006. SMUE was defined as the ratio
   of June August NDVI accumulation (NDVIacc) to average soil moisture
   (SMavg). This ratio was utilized to derive two additional indices
   representing drought stress (DSI) and sensitivity (DVI). We confined our
   vulnerability analyses to low NDVI regions because the determination of
   SSM/I soil moisture is unreliable in areas with high biomass. Both DSI
   and DVI identified high drought vulnerability in regions of the eastern
   Kazakhstan grasslands, western portions of the Hexi Corridor in the
   mid-north of China, the Gobi region, and the southwestern Mongolia
   grasslands. The identified vulnerable regions covered most of regions
   with land-degradation expansions or increased sand storm occurrence

Abstract = {Carbon (C) cycling in terrestrial ecosystems is influenced by the
   distribution of photo-assimilated C in the plant-soil system.
   Photo-assimilated C allocation in a wheat cropping system was examined
   to identify the links between soil fertility, C partitioning and soil C
   sequestration.
   A pulse labelling experiment was conducted where (CO2)-C-14 was
   introduced to wheat plants grown in two groups of soils of varying
   fertility: arable soils spiked with nutrients, and soils with differing
   land-use histories. Wheat shoot, root and soil samples were taken 1, 14
   and 28 days after pulse labelling to examine the fluxes of C-14 in the
   plant-root-soil system.
   The partitioning of C-14 in wheat plant-root-soil system was found to
   vary with time, nutrient spiked soil fertility and land-use history. At
   the end of the experiment using spiked soils, a positive correlation was
   observed between the allocation of C-14 in the shoots and soil
   fertility, whereas in the roots, this relationship was negative. The
   overall allocation of C-14 in the plant-root system differed
   significantly between the land-use histories; while in the spiked arable
   soils C-14 allocation in the shoots and roots systematically followed
   their fertility status.
   There was a weak relationship between C allocation and soil fertility in
   the soils of different land-use history compared to the strong
   relationship in the spiked arable soils. This suggests that other
   factors in the soils under different land uses were more important than

Abstract = {A commonly accepted challenge when visualising plant roots in X-ray
   micro Computed Tomography (mu CT) images is the similar X-ray
   attenuation of plant roots and soil phases. Soil moisture content
   remains a recognised, yet currently uncharacterised source of
   segmentation error. This work sought to quantify the effect of soil
   moisture content on the ability to segment roots from soil in mu CT
   images.
   Rice (Oryza sativa) plants grown in contrasting soils (loamy sand and
   clay loam) were mu CT scanned daily for nine days whilst drying from
   saturation. Root volumes were segmented from mu CT images and compared
   with volumes derived by root washing.
   At saturation the overlapping attenuation values of root material,
   water-filled soil pores and soil organic matter significantly hindered
   segmentation. However, in dry soil (ca. six days of drying
   post-saturation) the air-filled pores increased image noise adjacent to
   roots and impeded accurate visualisation of root material. The root
   volume was most accurately segmented at field capacity.
   Root volumes can be accurately segmented from mu CT images of
   undisturbed soil without compromising the growth requirements of the
   plant providing soil moisture content is kept at field capacity. We
   propose all future studies in this area should consider the error
   associated with scanning at different soil moisture contents.},

Abstract = {Many local weather station networks that measure a number of
   meteorological variables (i.e., mesonetworks) have recently been
   established, with soil moisture occasionally being part of the suite of
   measured variables. These mesonetworks provide data from which detailed
   estimates of various hydrological parameters, such as precipitation and
   reference evapotranspiration, can be made which, when coupled with
   simple surface characteristics available from soil surveys, can be used
   to obtain estimates of soil moisture. The question is Can meteorological
   data be used with a simple hydrologic model to estimate accurately daily
   soil moisture at a mesonetwork site? Using a state-of-the-art
   mesonetwork that also includes soil moisture measurements across the US
   State of Delaware, the efficacy of a simple, modified
   Thornthwaite/Mather-based daily water balance model based on these
   mesonetwork observations to estimate site-specific soil moisture is
   determined. Results suggest that the model works reasonably well for
   most well-drained sites and provides good qualitative estimates of
   measured soil moisture, often near the accuracy of the soil moisture
   instrumentation. The model exhibits particular trouble in that it cannot
   properly simulate the slow drainage that occurs in poorly drained soils
   after heavy rains and interception loss, resulting from grass not being
   short cropped as expected also adversely affects the simulation.
   However, the model could be tuned to accommodate some non-standard
   siting characteristics.},

Abstract = {A mesoscale convective system (MCS) case study was observed over
   northeast Mali as part of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis
   (AMMA) on 31 July 2006. Observations of this case suggest that the
   soil-moisture heterogeneity and atmospheric gravity waves emitted from a
   parent' MCS were important trigger mechanisms for this system. This
   study uses high-resolution Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) simulations
   to assess the importance of the synoptic circulation, land-surface and
   gravity waves in the initiation and development of the MCS. During the
   early afternoon shallow convection developed over a region of dry soil
   within a synoptic-scale convergence zone, which was caused by the
   confluence of the southerly monsoon flow with winds associated with the
   circulation around the Saharan heat low. Two pronounced waves were
   emitted from a nearby parent' storm and propagated towards the
   convergence zone. When the second wave reached the location of the
   shallow convection, deep convection was immediately initiated. Further
   convective cells developed later in the afternoon over dry soil, many
   adjacent to strong soil moisture gradients; these aggregated with the
   main storm, which later developed into the case study MCS. A comparison
   of model simulations with/without the soil-moisture heterogeneity and
   gravity waves shows that the synoptic-scale circulation and convergence
   zones, specified by the atmospheric analysis, were the most important
   factors for the successful simulation of the MCS. If the location of the
   initiation of the system is to be forecast accurately, the land-surface,
   that is, the soil moisture, must be represented adequately. In order to
   reproduce the timing of the secondary initiation of convection correctly
   the model must be able to capture gravity waves that are emitted by
   existing systems.},

Title = {A Preliminary Assessment of the Impact of Assimilating Satellite Soil

Journal = {ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {2018},
Abstract = {It is well documented that soil moisture has a strong impact on
   precipitation forecasts of numerical weather prediction models. Several
   microwave satellite soil moisture retrieval data products have also been
   available for applications. However, these observational data products
   have not been employed in any operational numerical weather or climate
   prediction models. In this study, a preliminary test of assimilating
   satellite soil moisture data products from the NOAA-NESDIS Soil Moisture
   Operational Product System (SMOPS) into the NOAA-NCEP Global Forecast
   System (GFS) is conducted. Using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF)
   introduced in recent year publications and implemented in the GFS, the
   multiple satellite blended daily global soil moisture data from SMOPS
   for the month of April 2012 are assimilated into the GFS. The forecasts
   of surface variables, anomaly correlations of isobar heights, and
   precipitation forecast skills of the GFS with and without the soil
   moisture data assimilation are assessed. The surface and deep layer soil
   moisture estimates of the GFS after the satellite soil moisture
   assimilation are found to have slightly better agreement with the ground
   soil moisture measurements at dozens of sites across the continental
   United States (CONUS). Forecasts of surface humidity and air
   temperature, 500 hPa height anomaly correlations, and the precipitation
   forecast skill demonstrated certain level of improvements after the soil
   moisture assimilation against those without the soil moisture
   assimilation. However, the methodology for the soil moisture data
   assimilation into operational GFS runs still requires further
   development efforts and tests.},

Abstract = {Background and aims Soil nitrogen (N) immobilization from cover crop
   residues may help suppress weeds. We established a gradient of cereal
   rye shoot biomass to determine the extent that soil N can be immobilized
   and its effect on redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus L.).
   Methods A microplot study was conducted in no-till cereal rye (Secale
   cereale L.)-soybean (Glycine max L. (Merr.)) systems at two sites in
   eastern USA. Microplots received 0, 2000, 5000, 8000, 12,000 or 15,000
   kg ha(-1) of cereal rye shoot biomass, and were injected with two mg
   N-15 kg(-1) soil 5 cm below the soil surface. Pigweeds were sown and
   allowed to germinate.
   Results Maximum rates of cereal rye shoot decomposition were observed at
   >= 5000 kg ha(-1). Although cereal rye shoot N declined, shoots became
   enriched with N-15, indicating fungal transfer of soil N to shoots. Soil
   inorganic N declined by an average of 5 kg N ha(-1). Pigweed tissue N
   and biomass were reduced in the presence of cereal rye. The magnitude of
   pigweed N reduction was similar across all shoot application rates.
   Conclusions We found weak evidence for a cereal rye shoot-based N
   immobilization mechanism of weed suppression. Our results indicate N
   immobilization may be primarily due to root residues.},

Abstract = {Mineralization and nitrification are the key processes of the global N
   cycle and are primarily driven by microorganisms. However, it remains
   largely unknown about the consequence of intensified agricultural
   activity on microbial N transformation in agricultural soils. In this
   study, the N-15-dilution technique was carried out to investigate the
   gross mineralization and nitrification in soils from a long-term field
   fertilization experiment starting from 1988. Phospholipid fatty acids
   (PLFA) analysis was used to determine soil microbial communities, e.g.,
   biomasses of anaerobic bacterial, bacterial, fungi, and actinobacteria.
   The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) were
   measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The
   results have demonstrated significant stimulation of gross
   mineralization in the chemical-fertilizers treatment (NPK) ({[}6.53 +/-
   1.29] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) and chemical fertilizersplusstraw treatment
   (NPK+S1) soils ({[}8.13 +/- 1.68] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) but not in chemical
   fertilizersplustwo times straw treatment (NPK+S2) soil when compared to
   the control-treatment (CK) soil ({[}3.62 +/- 0.86] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)).
   The increase of anaerobic bacterial biomass is up to 6-fold in the
   NPK+S2 compared to that in the CK soil ({[}0.7 +/- 0.5] nmol g(-1)),
   implying that exceptionally high abundance of anaerobic bacteria may
   inhibit gross mineralization to some extent. The gross nitrification
   shows upward trends in the NPK+S1 and NPK+S2 soils. However, it is only
   significantly higher in the NPK soil ({[}5.56 +/- 0.51] mg N kg(-1)
   d(-1)) compared to that in the CK soil ({[}3.70 +/- 0.47] mg N kg(-1)
   d(-1)) (p < 0.05). The AOB abundance increased from (0.28 +/- 0.07) x
   10(6) copies (g soil)1 for the CK treatment to (4.79 +/- 1.23) x 10(6)
   copies (g soil)(-1) for the NPK treatment after the 22-year
   fertilization. In contrast, the AOA abundance was not significantly
   different among all treatment soils. The changes of AOB were well
   paralleled by gross nitrification activity (gross nitrification rate =
   0.263 AOB + 0.047 NH4+-N + 2.434, R-2 = 0.73, p < 0.05), suggesting the
   predominance of bacterial ammonia oxidation in the fertilized fields.},

Abstract = {Representing spatially varying precipitation for current grid length
   scales used in General Circulation Models (GCMs) is a continuing
   challenge. Furthermore, to fully capture the hydrologic effects of
   nonuniform precipitation, a representation of soil moisture
   heterogeneity and distribution of spatially varying precipitation must
   exist within the same framework. For this study, the explicit and
   sampling methods of Sellers et al. (2007) are tested off-line using the
   Simple Biosphere Model (SiB3) in an arid, semiarid, and wet site, and
   are numerically compared to the bulk method, which is currently used in
   GCMs. To carry out the numerical experiments, an arbitrary grid area was
   defined by (1) a single instance of SiB3 (bulk method), (2) 100
   instances of SiB3 (explicit method), and (3) less than 100 instances of
   SiB3 (sampling method). Precipitation was randomly distributed over
   fractions of the grid area for the explicit and sampling methods, while
   the standard SiB3 exponential distribution relating precipitation
   intensity to the grid area wet fraction was used in the bulk method.
   Comparing the sampling and bulk method to the explicit method indicates
   that 10 instances of SiB3 in the sampling method better captures the
   spatial variability in soil moisture and grid area flux calculations
   produced by the explicit method, and deals realistically with spatially
   varying precipitation at little additional computational cost to the
   bulk method.},

Abstract = {Nitrogen fertilization of turfgrass continues to be scrutinized due to
   environmental concerns. Practices that reduce fertilizer inputs without
   sacrificing turfgrass quality are needed, but a reliable test of N
   status in turfgrass is not currently available. The Illinois soil N test
   has been developed to predict crop response to applied N by measuring
   the amount of amino sugar N in the soil. Amino sugar N does not
   fluctuate as rapidly as other forms of N in soil. Our objective is to
   determine the spatial variation of amino sugar N in soil to determine
   sampling frequency requirements for use of the Illinois soil N test as a
   management tool on golf course fairways. Soil samples from 0 to 15, 15
   to 30, and 30 to 45 cm were collected from golf course fairways in
   Minnesota and analyzed for amino sugar N concentration. Our data
   indicate that amino sugar N concentration decreases with depth but is
   not correlated to the concentration in the 0 to 15 cm layer. Amino sugar
   N concentrations measured on the four sampled fairways varied, but the
   spatial correlation present would allow for traditional soil sampling
   techniques to be used to assess the soil amino sugar N concentration

Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {101},
Number = {1-2},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {In order to investigate the sensitivity of a mesoscale convective system
   (MCS) to soil moisture inhomogeneities in West Africa,
   convection-permitting simulations with the COSMO model are performed.
   Three scenarios are investigated in detail: a homogeneous soil texture
   and soil moisture distribution and a homogeneous soil texture field with
   a north-south oriented band of two degrees width with reduced and
   increased soil moisture, respectively.
   In all experiments an MCS develops in the late afternoon some hundred
   kilometres east of the band with modified soil moisture. About 100 km
   east of the band, significant differences in precipitation occur: when
   the MCS approaches the band with lower soil moisture, precipitation
   decreases because of higher convective inhibition (CIN) and higher
   saturation deficit above the lifting condensation level ahead of the
   band. Reaching the dry band, precipitation restarts. The moist band
   causes an increase of precipitation ahead of the band and a decrease
   over it due to very high CIN and saturation deficit values above the
   boundary layer. In both cases, the soil moisture patterns induce a
   secondary circulation which modifies the conditions in the lower
   troposphere. These altered conditions are responsible for the changes of
   the convection-related parameters and for the modification of the MCS.
   Additionally, the dry band causes the evolution of precipitating cells
   over its western part in the late afternoon. The cells are triggered by
   superimposed convergences, one generated by the thermally-forced
   circulation of the dry band and the other one caused by different
   boundary-layer depths over the dry band and its surroundings. The very
   deep boundary layer over the dry band is accompanied by downward mixing
   of momentum from the African Easterly Jet, resulting in a reduced
   westerly monsoon flow so that convergence and divergence zones develop
   at the transitions from the deeper to the lower boundary layers. (C)

Abstract = {This study examines the capability of a new microwave land data
   assimilation system (LDAS) for estimating soil moisture in semiarid
   regions, where soil moisture is very heterogeneous. This system
   assimilates the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) 6.9- and 18.7-GHz brightness temperatures into
   a land surface model (LSM), with a radiative transfer model as an
   observation operator. To reduce errors caused by uncertainties of system
   parameters, the LDAS uses a dual-pass assimilation algorithm, with a
   calibration pass to estimate major model parameters from satellite data
   and an assimilation pass to estimate the near-surface soil moisture.
   Validation data of soil moisture were collected in a Mongolian semiarid
   region. Results show that (i) the LDAS-estimated soil moistures are
   comparable to areal averages of in situ measurements, though the
   measured soil moistures were highly variable from site to site; (ii) the
   LSM-simulated soil moistures show less biases when the LSM uses
   LDAS-calibrated parameter values instead of default parameter values,
   indicating that the satellite-based calibration does contribute to soil
   moisture estimations; and (iii) compared to the LSM, the LDAS produces
   more robust and reliable soil moisture when forcing data become worse.
   The lower sensitivity of the LDAS output to precipitation is
   particularly encouraging for applying this system to regions where
   precipitation data are prone to errors.},

Abstract = {Knowledge of the spatial distribution of global soil moisture for a long
   period of time is crucial to the understanding of climate changes and
   land surface processes. The observations from spaceborne passive
   microwave sensors for more than 30 years are very valuable for
   generating historical soil moisture maps. Except those from the Soil
   Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, which was launched in
   November 2009, most of the observations available are from sensors with
   frequencies much higher than L-band and are more sensitive to vegetation
   conditions. To rebuild long-term soil moisture data sets with an
   improved accuracy, a method to correct vegetation effects at X-band or
   higher frequencies using L-band soil moisture retrievals is explored in
   this study. Validations based on b-parameter values derived from both
   field-sampled soil moisture with noises added and the actual SMOS
   products indicate that the method can be applied to the observations
   from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing
   System or similar sensors and help to rebuild historical soil moisture
   data sets with a root-mean-square error less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3).},

Title = {Soil moisture estimation with a remotely sensed dry edge determination
   based on the land surface temperature-vegetation index method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},

Abstract = {As a crucial parameter in land surface systems, soil moisture plays an
   important role in surface energy balance studies, environmental
   detection, and global climate change research. Remotely sensed data have
   been used for estimating soil moisture through different approaches,
   which has resulted in many achievements. Previous studies showed that
   the land surface temperature (LST) vegetation index method (LST-VI
   method) can obtain surface soil moisture with remote sensing sources,
   and it is relatively simple and easy to operate at a regional scale.
   However, one thorny difficulty is the dry edge determination from the
   LST-VI feature space. In this study, a remote sensing method is proposed
   to determine the theoretical dry edge from the LST-VI scatter plots,
   which do not require any ground measured auxiliary data. Based on the
   surface energy balance principle, this method derived the maximum LSTs
   for bare soil and full vegetation cover using MODIS products. The air
   temperature is parameterized by the LST using a semiempirical formula as
   the theoretical wet edge. The estimated soil moisture is validated by in
   situ measurements at a comprehensive weather station of Yucheng. The
   coefficient of determination is similar to 0.60, and the root mean
   square error is about 0.08 m(3)/m(3). The relevant key parameters in
   determining the dry edge are also validated from the meteorological
   observation. The air temperature and net surface shortwave radiation
   flux all reach a very high level, with an RMSE of 3.75 k and 49.3 W
   m(-2), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method
   can derive the accurate dry edge to estimate soil moisture from the
   remote sensing data, which will provide great help for future studies of
   soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques. (C) 2019

Abstract = {Current restoration efforts for the Chesapeake Bay watershed mandate a
   timeline for reducing the load of nutrients and sediment into receiving
   waters. The Chesapeake Bay watershed model (WSM) has been used for two
   decades to simulate hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport;
   however, spatial limitations of the WSM preclude edge-of-field scale
   representation of phosphorus (P) losses. Rather, the WSM relies on
   literature-derived, county-scale rates of P loss (targets) for simulated
   land uses. An independent field-scale modeling tool, Annual Phosphorus
   Loss Estimator (APLE), was used as an alternative to the current WSM
   approach. Identical assumptions of county-level acreage, soil
   properties, nutrient management practices, and transport factors from
   the WSM were used as inputs to APLE. Incorporation of APLE P-loss
   estimates resulted in greater estimated total P loss and a revised
   spatial pattern of P loss compared with the WSM's original targets.
   Subsequently, APLE's revised estimates for P loss were substituted into
   the WSM and resulted in improved WSM calibration performance at up to
   79\% of tributary monitoring stations. The incorporation of APLE into
   the WSM will improve its ability to assess P loss and the impact of

Abstract = {{[}1] Soil moisture is a very important variable in land surface
   processes. Both field moisture measurements and estimates from modeling
   have their limitations when being used to estimate soil moisture on a
   large spatial scale. Remote sensing is becoming a practical method to
   estimate soil moisture globally; however, the quality of current soil
   surface moisture products needs to be improved in order to meet
   practical requirements. Data assimilation (DA) is a promising approach
   to merge model dynamics and remote sensing observations, thus having the
   potential to estimate soil moisture more accurately. In this study, a
   data assimilation algorithm, which couples the particle filter and the
   kernel smoothing technique, is presented to estimate soil moisture and
   soil parameters from microwave signals. A simple hydrological model with
   a daily time step is utilized to reduce the computational burden in the
   process of data assimilation. An observation operator based on the ratio
   of two microwave brightness temperatures at different frequencies is
   designed to link surface soil moisture with remote sensing measurements,
   and a sensitivity analysis of this operator is also conducted.
   Additionally, a variant of particle filtering method is developed for
   the joint estimation of soil moisture and soil parameters such as
   texture and porosity. This assimilation scheme is validated against
   field moisture measurements at the CEOP/Mongolia experiment site and is
   found to estimate near-surface soil moisture very well. The retrieved
   soil texture still contains large uncertainties as the retrieved values
   cannot converge to fixed points or narrow ranges when using different
   initial soil texture values, but the retrieved soil porosity has
   relatively small uncertainties.},

Title = {Near-surface soil moisture assimilation for quantifying effective soil
   hydraulic properties using genetic algorithms: 2. Using airborne remote
   sensing during SGP97 and SMEX02},
Journal = {WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {45},
Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Pixel-based effective soil hydraulic parameters are crucial inputs for
   large-scale hydroclimatic modeling. In this paper, we extend/apply a
   genetic algorithm (GA) approach for estimating these parameters at the
   scale of an airborne remote sensing (RS) footprint. To estimate these
   parameters, we used a time series of near-surface RS soil moisture data
   to invert a physically based soil-water-atmosphere-plant (SWAP) model
   with a (multipopulated) modified-microGA. Uncertainties in the solutions
   were examined in two ways: (1) by solving the inverse problem under
   various combinations of modeling conditions in a respective way; and (2)
   the same as the first method but the inverse solutions were determined
   in a collective way aimed at finding the robust solutions for all the
   modeling conditions (ensembles). A cross validation of the derived soil
   hydraulic parameters was done to check their effectiveness for all the
   modeling conditions used. For our case studies, we considered three
   electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) footprints in
   Oklahoma and four polarimetric scanning radiometer (PSR) footprints in
   Iowa during the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology Experiment
   and Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) campaigns, respectively. The
   results clearly showed the promising potentials of near-surface RS soil
   moisture data combined with inverse modeling for determining average
   soil hydrologic properties at the footprint scale. Our cross validation
   showed that parameters derived by method 1 under water table (bottom
   boundary) conditions are applicable also for free-draining conditions.
   However, parameters derived under free-draining conditions generally
   produced too wet near-surface soil moisture when applied under water
   table conditions. Method 2, on the other hand, produced robust parameter
   sets applicable for all modeling conditions used. These results were
   validated using distributed in situ soil moisture and soil hydraulic
   properties measurements, and texture-based data from the UNSODA
   database. In this study, we conclude that inverse modeling of RS soil
   moisture data is a promising approach for parameter estimation at large
   measurement support scale. Nevertheless, the derived effective soil
   hydraulic parameters are subject to the uncertainties of remotely sensed
   soil moisture data and from the assumptions used in the
   soil-water-atmosphere-plant modeling. Method 2 provides a flexible
   framework for accounting these sources of uncertainties in the inverse
   estimation of large-scale soil hydraulic properties. We have illustrated
   this flexibility by combining multiple data sources and various modeling
   conditions in our large-scale inverse modeling.},

Title = {Effects of soil water content on growth, tillering, and manganese uptake

Abstract = {A 2-year field experiment and a pot experiment were carried out to
   compare Mn uptake, tillering, and plant growth of lowland rice grown
   under different soil water conditions in the ground-cover
   rice-production system (GCRPS) in Beijing, North China. The field
   experiment was conducted in 2001 and 2002, including two treatments:
   lowland-rice variety (Oryza sativa L. spp. Japonica) grown under thin
   (14 gm) plastic-film soil cover (GCRPS(plastic)) at 80\%-90\%
   water-holding capacity (WHC) and traditional lowland rice (paddy
   control) grown with 3cm standing-water table. The pot experiment was
   conducted in a greenhouse with four treatments: (1) traditional lowland
   rice: paddy control; (2) GCRPS, water-saturated soil: GCRPS(saturated);
   (3) GCRPS at 90\% water-holding capacity (WHC): GCRPS(90\%WHC); and (4)
   GCRPS at 70\% WHC: GCRPS(70\%WHC). Results of the field experiment
   showed that dry-matter production, number of tillers, as well as N and
   Mn concentrations in rice shoots of GCRPS were significantly lower than
   in paddy control, while there was no significant difference in shoot Fe,
   Cu, Zn, and P concentration and nematode populations. In the pot
   experiment, shoot Mn concentration significantly decreased with
   decreasing soil water content, while soil redox potential increased.
   Shoot-dry matter production and tiller number of GCRPSsaturated were
   significantly higher than in other treatments. Significant correlations
   were observed between the shoot Mn concentration and tiller number at
   maximum tillering stage in the field and pot experiment, respectively.
   We therefore conclude that the limitation of Mn acquisition might
   contribute to the growth and yield reduction of lowland rice grown in
   GCRPS. The experiment provides evidence that GCRPSplastic combined with
   nearly water-saturated soil conditions helps saving water and achieving
   optimum crop development without visual or latent Mn deficiency as
   observed under more aerobic conditions.},

Abstract = {Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), as an approach, has been developed for
   the measurement of soil dielectric constants. As it stands, the standard
   dielectric of dry soil is much less than the dielectric of soil exposed
   to water, and the volume of water present significantly affects the
   propagation of electromagnetic waves. With this in mind, this paper
   proposes a plan for the design and implementation of two distinct
   isolated probe structures for the measurement of water contents within
   the soil at different levels. Accordingly, Probe A is used to determine
   the water level present in soil at four different depths. Probe A does
   this by utilizing pairs of parabolic copper sections fixed horizontally
   and isolated over the outer surface of an access tube. Probe B, on the
   other hand, makes use of two steel rings buried vertically inside of an
   access tube, and is used to determine the water contents of soil on two
   levels. To do so, a fixed frequency square-wave is transmitted to
   measure the soil capacitance in which the probe sensors are connected to
   an Arduino microcontroller which also included air humidity, air
   temperature, and soil temperature sensors. During the experimental
   assessment of both probes, the results are loaded onto an SD memory card
   and are then compared with the results of other commercial sensors
   installed in the same irrigated plot. The soil moisture monitoring
   station used is powered by a photovoltaic (PV) module of 10 W 12 V and a
   storage battery of 12 Ah. The experimental monitoring station used to
   assess the efficiency of both probe designs was set up in a
   Mediterranean semiarid zone in the Southeast of Spain.},

Abstract = {Monitoring and estimating grid-mean soil moisture is very important for
   assessing many hydrological, biological, and biogeochemical processes
   and for validating remotely sensed surface soil moisture products.
   Temporal stability analysis (TSA) is a valuable tool for identifying a
   small number of representative sampling points to estimate the grid-mean
   soil moisture content. This analysis was evaluated and improved using
   high-quality surface soil moisture data that were acquired by a wireless
   sensor network in a high-intensity irrigated agricultural landscape in
   an arid region of northwestern China. The performance of the TSA was
   limited in areas where the representative error was dominated by random
   events, such as irrigation events. This shortcoming can be effectively
   mitigated by using a stratified TSA (STSA) method, proposed in this
   paper. In addition, the following methods were proposed for rapidly and
   efficiently identifying representative sampling points when using TSA.
   (1) Instantaneous measurements can be used to identify representative
   sampling points to some extent; however, the error resulting from this
   method is significant when validating remotely sensed soil moisture
   products. Thus, additional representative sampling points should be
   considered to reduce this error. (2) The calibration period can be
   determined from the time span of the full range of the grid-mean soil
   moisture content during the monitoring period. (3) The representative
   error is sensitive to the number of calibration sampling points,
   especially when only a few representative sampling points are used.
   Multiple sampling points are recommended to reduce data loss and improve
   the likelihood of representativeness at two scales.},

   2006 was higher (P = 0.01) in the integrated system (11.6 Mg ha(-1))
   compared with continuous corn (10.6 Mg ha(-1)). Total soil C
   concentration increased significantly from 2002 to 2005 within
   components of the integrated system but remained unchanged in continuous
   corn. Microbial biomass C was also higher in the integrated system but
   only in 2005. The study determined that integration of crops with
   livestock had generally positive effects on crop yield and soil organic
   matter despite the potential for livestock to compact soil during winter
   grazing.},

Title = {Soil phosphorus bioavailability assessed by XANES and Hedley sequential

Abstract = {The primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems is influenced by soil
   phosphorus bioavailability, which depends largely on chemical fractions
   of phosphorus. The sequential fractionation technique developed by
   Hedley et al. or its subsequent modification is a well-known method to
   determine soil phosphorus forms. Hedley sequential fractionation
   technique separates the phosphorus into fractions based on their
   different chemical solubilities in extractants with certain chemical
   properties. Recently, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge
   structure (XANES) spectroscopy has been employed to measure soil
   phosphorus species directly and non-invasively. The XANES method
   provides information concerning local structure and chemical information
   of target elements at a molecular level. Thus, it can distinguish
   phosphorus fractions bound by metal oxides or hydroxides (such as Fe,
   Al, and Ca). In this present work, the phosphorus speciation of topsoil
   along a glacial foreland chronosequence in Gongga Mountain is determined
   using these two methods. The changes in soil phosphorus bioavailability
   along the 120-year-old chronosequence are assessed based on comparisons
   of the results obtained by these two methods. The results indicate that
   Hedley sequential fractionation technique shows a greater ability to
   determine soil bioavailable phosphorus (Resin-P and NaCHO3-P), while
   XANES is effective in distinguishing phosphorus bound by metal
   compounds. In the chronosequence, Ca- and Al-bound phosphorus were
   derived mainly from primary minerals, whose phosphorus contents
   decreased within 120 years of moraine weathering and soil development.
   The content of soil bioavailable phosphorus increased rapidly after 30
   years since deglaciation. The increasing phosphorus bioavailability
   promoted the colonizing and primary succession vegetation.},

Abstract = {Soil application of sewage sludge in crop production offers an
   alternative technique for its disposal and management. The present study
   was taken up to evaluate the effect of sewage sludge on yield of rice,
   soil fertility and heavy metals accumulation in grain and straw in a
   glass house. The residual effect of sludge application was evaluated in
   subsequent wheat crop in the sequence. Five doses of sludge i.e., 0,10,
   20, 30 and 40 t ha(-1) were applied to rice and their effects were
   compared with the recommended dose of fertilizers i.e., 120, 60 and 60
   kg N, P2O5 and K2O ha(-1), respectively. There was significant increase
   in straw and grain yields of both the crops with application of sludge.
   The grain yield of rice increased 45\% at 40 t ha(-1) sludge application
   over no sludge. The residual effect on wheat yield was more pronounced.
   Soil pH in post harvest rice soil increased with the application of
   sludge, however, it decreased in post harvest wheat soil at higher
   levels of sludge application. Increase in available nutrients content of
   soil was also recorded with increasing levels of sludge application
   after harvest of rice and wheat crops. Application of sludge also
   increased the heavy metals contents in soil and plant. The Cd content in
   rice grain was above the Indian safe limit at 20 t ha(-1) or higher
   levels of sludge application. There was a significant build up of P, S,
   Zn, Fe, and Mn in post harvest wheat soil at 40 t ha(-1) sludge

   areas. Therefore, our aim was to assess soil fertility attributes at
   different depths on a BSB grown with Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu
   grass, the influence of SPS with native tree zeyheria (Zeyheria
   tuberculosa) settled in 1984, or with the exotic eucalyptus (Eucalyptus
   grandis) settled in 1994. The soil water pH, P, Ca, Mg, and K contents,
   as well as soil base sum and saturation, were found superior mostly at
   the top layer (0-2 cm) of the eucalyptus site, than for the ip-felpudo
   site. This response was correlated to greater soil organic matter and
   carbon at the eucalyptus site, which demonstrated to have high nutrient
   cycling rates. Around 50 \% of the CEC in both SPSs was occupied by
   bases, demonstrating that the areas have large potential to absorb
   applied nutrients. The SPSs have no significant impact on S-SO4 (2-) or
   micronutrient availability. The litter composition in eucalyptus site
   was accountable for the superior results of this SPS, which has shown as
   a promising choice for land use and conservation in the BSB.},

Abstract = {A field study was conducted during 2003-2005 to compare the relative
   efficacy of three mulches (viz. rice straw, subabul leaf and weeds) and
   quantities (6, 8 and 10 tonnes/ha) on soil moisture retention and
   productivity of rainfed ginger in a gamari based agroforestry system in
   Mizoram. Soil moisture conservation was significantly (P = 0.05)
   affected by mulch type and quantity of mulch applied. Soil moisture
   retention in the plots was in the order of rice straw>subabul leaf>weeds
   and 10 t/ha >8 t/ha >6 t/ha mulch applied. The number of sprout, sprout
   frequency, tiller height and finger size of ginger were better in the
   mulched plots when compared with the unmulched (control) plots. Ginger
   yield in the mulched plots was in the order of subabul leaf>rice
   straw>weeds. The slower decomposition of rice straw caused greater
   moisture retention while quick decomposition of subabul leaf caused
   increased addition of nitrogen to the soil thereby increased ginger
   yield. Our study depicts the favourable role played by the mulches in
   soil conservation in the hilly terrain of Mizoram. Further, the study
   demonstrates that the common weeds can be effectively used in conserving
   soil moisture and improving crop productivity.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURE-BASEL},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {8},
Number = {10},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Harvesting Miscanthus x giganteus (J.M. Greef \& Deuter ex Hodkinson \&
   Renvoize) after shoot emergence is known to reduce yields in subsequent
   seasons. This research was conducted in Miscanthus to assess the effects
   on crop response and soil compaction of annually repeated traffic,
   applied both before new growth in the rhizomes (early harvest) and after
   shoot emergence (late harvest), at two different soil moisture contents.
   While an annual early harvest, yields more than a late harvest, because
   damage to new shoots is avoided, soil compaction may be increased
   following repeated harvests. Five treatments were tested: (a) An
   untrafficked control, (b) early-traffic on soil with typical soil
   moisture content (SMC) (early-normal), (c) early-traffic on soil with
   elevated SMC (early-elevated), (d) late-traffic on soil with typical SMC
   (late-normal) and (e) late-traffic on soil with elevated SMC (late-wet).
   The experiment was conducted on a Gleysol in Co. Dublin, Ireland during
   2010 and 2011. Crop response effects were assessed by measuring stem
   numbers, stem height, trafficked zone biomass yield (November) and
   overall stem yield (January). Compaction effects were assessed by
   measuring penetration resistance, bulk density and water infiltration
   rate. Trafficked zone biomass yield in the early-dry and early-wet
   treatments was, respectively, 18\% and 23\% lower than in the control,
   but was, respectively, 39\% and 31\% higher than in the late-dry
   treatment. Overall, stem yield was significantly lower in the
   late-normal and late-wet treatments (10.4 and 10.1 tdm ha(-1)
   respectively) when compared with the control (12.4 tdm ha(-1)), but no
   significant difference was recorded in overall stem yield between both
   early-traffic treatments and the control. Penetration resistance values
   were significantly higher in all trafficked treatments when compared
   with the control at depths of 0.15 m (54-61\%) and 0.30 m (27-57\%) and
   were significantly higher in 2011 when compared with 2010 at depths of
   0.15 and 0.30 m. Baler system traffic in Miscanthus significantly
   reduced yields and significantly increased compaction annually.
   Miscanthus harvested early, on a dry soil, yielded 1.1 tdm ha(-1) more
   than when harvested late on a dry soil. The yield advantage increased to
   1.3 tdm ha(-1) when early harvesting on a soil with 40-43\% moisture
   content was compared with late harvesting on a wetter soil (51-52\%
   moisture content). In this study, the magnitude of yield losses from
   compaction or other causes in early harvests was substantially lower
   than the yield losses, which resulted from shoot damage in late
   harvests. It is likely in similar climates that the results of this
   study would also apply to other perennial crops growing in similar soil
   types.},

Journal = {AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {103},
Pages = {43-53},

Abstract = {Field experiments were conducted during 2007-2009 to study the effect of
   deficit irrigation practices through drip irrigation system on soil
   moisture distribution and root growth in cotton-maize cropping sequence.
   Creation of soil moisture gradient is indispensable to explore the
   beneficial effects of partial root zone drying (PRD) irrigation and it
   could be possible only through ADI practice in paired row system of drip
   layout, that is commonly practiced in India. In the present study, PRD
   and deficit irrigation (DI) concepts (creation of soil moisture
   gradient) were implemented through alternate deficit irrigation (ADI) at
   two levels of irrigation using drip system. Experimental treatments
   comprised of six irrigation levels (full and deficit) through drip
   system with surface irrigation for comparison. Maize was sown after
   cotton under no till condition without disturbing the raised bed and
   drip layout. Roots confined to the shallow depth and recorded the lowest
   values for both the crops under conventional drip irrigation at 100\%
   ETc. Among the deficit irrigation treatments, mild deficit irrigation
   produced longer lateral roots from both the sides of the plant. Contrary
   to rooting depth, severe water stress affected the lateral root spread
   and recorded lower values than other drip irrigation treatments. Soil
   moisture content (SMC) was low nearer to the plant (at 30 cm across the
   lateral) and far away (at 30 cm along the lateral) from the plant,
   irrespective of treatments. The reduction in SMC was increased at all
   locations as applied water level decreased. It is concluded that
   alternate watering imposed through ADI at 100\% ETc produced longer
   lateral roots with higher values for root dry mass Alternate deficit
   irrigation (ADI) resulted uneven distribution of soil moisture content.
   Among the ADI treatments, ADI at 100\% had less uneven distribution than
   ADI at 80\% ETc. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Many researches have been conducted to improve fallow system, and the

   why this research examines the factors that are related to the use of
   indigenous knowledge on fallow practices by small-scale food crop
   farmers in Iseyin Local Government Area of Oyo State. The findings show
   that majority of the farmers were above 40 years with no formal
   education and still practice indigenous fallow system despite their
   contact with extension agents. It was also found that the use of
   Indigenous Knowledge on fallow practices have strong relationship with
   fanner's age, educational level, social participation, contact with
   extension and sources of information. These variables however could
   explain 58 per cent of the variation in indigenous knowledge use on
   fallow practices adopted respectively by farmers. Significant
   determinants were age (t = 1.61), gender (t = 2.65), household size (t =

Abstract = {In sorghum and mungbean - lentil cropping system, field experiments were
   conducted for three successive years to assess the effect of mung bean
   residue incorporation on sorghum and succeeding lentil productivity
   along with different doses of phosphorus (P; 0, 30, 60 kg ha-(1))
   applied to these crops. The level of soil fertility was also tested with
   or without incorporation of mung bean residue. The interaction of
   phosphorus to mungbean residue incorporation was thus studied in
   relation to improve crop productivity with balancing fertilizer
   requirements through an eco-friendly approach. Sorghum grain yield
   increased significantly when 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1) was applied and mungbean
   residue incorporated. The response was reduced to 30 kg P2O5 ha(-1) when
   mungbean residue was not incorporated. The succeeding lentil crop

Abstract = {The multi-satellite-retrieved (ESA CCI SM) and the Global Land Data
   Assimilation System-Noah-simulated (GLDAS-Noah) surface soil moisture
   (SM) datasets are compared for global drought analysis over a
   multi-decadal time period (1991-2015). Global drought events and their
   duration, frequency and severity are assessed on a grid basis with soil
   moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI). The results show that the ESA
   CCI SM and the GLDAS-Noah based SMAPI values are significantly (p <
   0.05) correlated over most (83\%) of the study region, of seasonally
   dependent. Both datasets show similar global patterns in drought
   duration, drought frequency and drought severity. The droughts present
   generally longer duration, higher frequency and more severity in arid
   and semi-arid regions than humid and sub-humid regions. The ESA CCI SM
   droughts are relatively higher in frequency and more intense in severity
   than the GLDAS-Noah SM droughts in many regions of the globe, while the
   two datasets show considerable differences in drought duration over
   arid, semi-arid and highly vegetated regions. For long-term trend
   detection, both datasets show high consistency in spatial pattern of
   SMAPI, with major significant drying trends in arid and semi-arid
   regions. Part (similar to 20\%) trends are confirmed by the Global
   Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation dataset using the
   Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The two SM datasets exhibit large
   disparity in trending drought duration, drought frequency and drought
   severity. Despite that, both show major significant increasing trends in
   arid and semi-arid regions. Both soil moisture datasets are capable of
   identifying extreme drought events reported in southern China, North
   America, Europe and southern Africa. The ESA CCI SM dataset is more
   effective in determining the severity and spatial pattern of drought
   excluding densely vegetated regions, while the GLDAS-Noah dataset is
   more powerful in detecting drought occurrence, even over densely
   vegetated regions. Overall, the ESA CCI SM and GLDAS-Noah SM show
   potential in global drought analysis, yet cautions should be paid to
   arid and semi-arid regions where drying trends are prevalent and large
   discrepancy presents between two datasets.},

Year = {2012},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This study presents a numerical experiment to assess the impact of
   satellite rainfall error structure on the efficiency of assimilating
   near-surface soil moisture observations. Specifically, the study
   contrasts a multidimensional satellite rainfall error model (SREM2D) to
   a simpler rainfall error model (CTRL) currently used to generate
   rainfall ensembles as part of the ensemble-based land data assimilation
   system developed at the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office.
   The study is conducted in the Oklahoma region using rainfall data from a
   NOAA multisatellite global rainfall product {[}the Climate Prediction
   Center (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH)] and the National Weather
   Service rain gauge-calibrated radar rainfall product {[}Weather
   Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D)] representing the
   ``uncertain{''} and ``reference{''} model rainfall forcing,
   respectively. Soil moisture simulations using the Catchment land surface
   model (CLSM), obtained by forcing the model with reference rainfall, are
   randomly perturbed to represent satellite retrieval uncertainty, and
   assimilated into CLSM as synthetic near-surface soil moisture
   observations. The assimilation estimates show improved performance
   metrics, exhibiting higher anomaly correlation coefficients (e.g.,
   similar to 0.79 and similar to 0.90 in the SREM2D nonassimilation and
   assimilation experiments for root zone soil moisture, respectively) and
   lower root-mean-square errors (e.g., similar to 0.034 m(3) m(-3) and
   similar to 0.024 m(3) m(-3) in the SREM2D nonassimilation and
   assimilation experiments for root zone soil moisture, respectively). The
   more elaborate rainfall error model in the assimilation system leads to
   slightly improved assimilation estimates. In particular, the relative
   enhancement due to SREM2D over CTRL is larger for root zone soil
   moisture and in wetter rainfall conditions.},

Abstract = {An efficient method for the analysis and modelling of ecological systems
   with fuzzy, structural, and functional organization is advanced. The
   method, called system-analytical modelling, is based on an
   information-hierarchical approach, as well as on numerical experiments
   with the use of vast experimental data on system dynamics. Using this
   method, two theoretically best accuracies of ecological models can be
   reached. The first accuracy characterizes an adequacy of description of
   the ecological processes/system structure and is found equal to 1\%. The
   second characterizes the discrepancy between the calculated and
   experimental data, and is formed by a standard deviation (coefficient of
   variation) of 24.2\%, separately for some substance and time
   characteristics of specific basic processes of ecological systems. New
   relationships of moisture exchange in freezing and thawing soils were
   revealed and quantitatively estimated. The developed model of
   soil-moisture exchange has an accuracy of 24\% and allows tracing of the
   soil-moisture dynamics in agroecosystems of any middle latitude area

Abstract = {Agricultural practices affect the bacterial community structure, but how
   they determine the response of the bacterial community to drought, is
   still largely unknown. Conventional cultivated soil, i.e., inorganic
   fertilization, tillage, crop residue removal and maize (Zea mays L.)
   monoculture, and traditional organic farmed soil ``milpa,{''} i.e.,
   minimum tillage, rotation of maize, pumpkin (Cucurbita sp.) and beans
   (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and organic fertilization were sampled. Both
   soils from the central highlands of Mexico were characterized and
   incubated aerobically at 5\% field capacity (5\%FC) and 100\% field
   capacity (FC) for 45 days, while the C and N mineralization, enzyme
   activity and the bacterial community structure were monitored. After
   applying the different agricultural practices 3 years, the organic C
   content was 1.8-times larger in the milpa than in the conventional
   cultivated soil, the microbial biomass C 1.3-times, and C and N
   mineralization 2.0-times (mean for soil incubated at 5\%FC and FC). The
   dehydrogenase, activity was significantly higher in the conventional
   cultivated soil than in the milpa soil when incubated at 5\%FC, but not
   when incubated at FC. The relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes was
   larger in the conventional cultivated soil than in the milpa soil in
   soil both at 5\%FC and FC, while that of Bacteroidetes showed an
   opposite trend. The relative abundance of other groups, such as
   Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria, was affected by cultivation technique,
   but controlled by soil water content. The relative abundance of other
   groups, e.g., FBP, Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobacteria, was affected by
   water content, but the effect depended on agricultural practice. For
   soil incubated at FC, the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism
   related functions were higher in the milpa soil than in the conventional
   cultivated soil, and carbohydrate metabolism showed an opposite trend.
   It was found that agricultural practices and soil water content had a
   strong effect on soil characteristics, C and N mineralization, enzyme
   activity, and the bacterial community structure and its functionality.
   Decreases or increases in the relative abundance of bacterial groups
   when the soil water content decreased, i.e., from FC to 5\%FC, was
   defined often by the cultivation technique, and the larger organic
   matter content in the milpa soil did not prevent large changes in the
   bacterial community structure when the soil was dried.},

Abstract = {Debris flows represent frequent hazards in mountain regions. Though
   significant effort has been made to predict such events, the trigger
   conditions as well as the hydrologic disposition of a watershed at the
   time of debris flow occurrence are not well understood. Traditional
   intensity-duration threshold techniques to establish trigger conditions
   generally do not account for distinct influences of rainfall, snowmelt,
   and antecedent moisture. To improve our knowledge on the connection
   between debris flow initiation and the hydrologic system at a regional
   scale, this study explores the use of a semi-distributed conceptual
   rainfall-runoff model, linking different system variables such as soil
   moisture, snowmelt, or runoff with documented debris flow events in the
   inner Pitztal watershed, Austria. The model was run on a daily basis
   between 1953 and 2012. Analysing a range of modelled system state and
   flux variables at days on which debris flows occurred, three distinct
   dominant trigger mechanisms could be clearly identified. While the
   results suggest that for 68\%(17 out of 25) of the observed debris flow
   events during the study period high-intensity rainfall was the dominant
   trigger, snowmelt was identified as the dominant trigger for 24\% (6 out
   of 25) of the observed debris flow events. In addition, 8\% (2 out of
   25) of the debris flow events could be attributed to the combined
   effects of low-intensity, long-lasting rainfall and transient storage of
   this water, causing elevated antecedent soil moisture conditions. The
   results also suggest a relatively clear temporal separation between the
   distinct trigger mechanisms, with high-intensity rainfall as a trigger
   being limited to mid-and late summer. The dominant trigger in late
   spring/early summer is snowmelt. Based on the discrimination between
   different modelled system states and fluxes and, more specifically,
   their temporally varying importance relative to each other, this
   exploratory study demonstrates that already the use of a relatively
   simple hydrological model can prove useful to gain some more insight
   into the importance of distinct debris flow trigger mechanisms. This
   highlights in particular the relevance of snowmelt contributions and the
   switch between mechanisms during early to mid-summer in snow-dominated
   systems.},

Abstract = {Mineralization contributes significantly to agronomic nitrogen (N)
   budgets and is difficult to accurately predict. Models for predicting
   N-mineralization contributions are needed, and development of these
   models will require field-based data. In situ mineralization methods are
   intended to quantify N mineralization under ambient environmental
   conditions. This study was conducted to compare soil moisture and
   temperature in intact soil cores contained in cylinders to those in
   adjacent bulk soil, compare the effect of two resin-bag techniques on
   water content of soil within cylinders, and assess the effect of
   installation duration on inorganic N retention by resins. The study was
   conducted at a dryland conventionally tilled corn (Zea mays L.) site and
   an irrigated no-tillage corn site in eastern Nebraska. Soil in cylinders
   was slightly wetter (<0.05 g g(-1)) and warmer (<1 degrees C) than
   adjacent soil. Soil water content was, <80\% water-filled pore space
   (WFPS) at all sampling times and differed little between the two
   resin-bag techniques. Greater soil water content and temperature
   conditions (though small) observed during most of the study period
   likely enhanced N mineralization within the cylinder compared to N
   mineralization in adjacent bulk soil, but the magnitude is likely much
   less than core-to-core variation normally observed in a field.
   Installing cylinders for more than 60 days resulted in loss of inorganic
   N from resins. Care is needed during installation to ensure that
   compaction of soil below the cylinder does not impede water movement
   through the intact soil core. The in situ method utilizing intact soil
   cores and resin bags replaced at 28- to 40-day intervals is a viable
   method for measuring N mineralization.},

Abstract = {Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture,
   but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and
   root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar
   applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate
   fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative
   fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and
   thermal remote-sensing images {[}e.g. using the Remote Sensing of
   Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture
   through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar
   approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation.
   The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for
   estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a
   semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was
   monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with
   herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3 years. In situ soil
   moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with
   estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The
   in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with
   evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies
   typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of
   saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce
   estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various
   applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable
   for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more
   successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability
   in degree of saturation for this region. Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley

Volume = {5},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a vital parameter in various land surface processes,
   and microwave remote sensing is widely used to estimate regional soil
   moisture. However, the application of the retrieved soil moisture data
   is restricted by its coarse spatial resolution. To overcome this
   weakness, many methods were proposed to downscale microwave soil
   moisture data. The traditional method is the microwave-optical/IR
   synergistic approach, in which land surface temperature (LST),
   vegetation index and surface albedo are key parameters. However, due to
   the uncertainty in absolute LST estimation, this approach is partly
   dependent on the accuracy of LST estimation. To eliminate the impacts of
   LST estimation, an improved downscaling method is proposed in this study
   to downscale Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth
   Observing System (AMSR-E) Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil
   moisture product with visible and thermal data of Meteosat Second
   Generation (MSG)-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI).
   Two temperature temporal variation parameters related to soil moisture,
   including mid-morning rising rate and daily maximum temperature time,
   are introduced in the proposed method to replace LST. The proposed
   method and the traditional method are both applied to the Iberian
   Peninsula area for July and August 2007. Comparison of the two results
   shows that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) has an average
   improvement of 0.08 and the root mean square error has a systematic
   decrease. The downscaled soil moisture by the proposed method was
   validated by REMEDHUS soil moisture network in the study area, and site
   specific validation gets poor correlation between the two datasets
   because of the low spatial representativeness of site measurement for
   one MSG-SEVIRI pixel. Although the comparisons at 15 km and network
   scale show an improvement over the site specific comparison, it is found
   that the downscaling method systematically degrades the accuracy in soil
   moisture data, with a R-squared of 0-0.4 and 0.218 for the downscaled
   data set against 0.7-0.8 and 0.571 for AMSR-E data at 15 km scale and
   the network scale respectively.},

Abstract = {Earth Observation (EO) provides a promising approach towards deriving
   accurate spatiotemporal estimates of key parameters characterizing land
   surface interactions, such as latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes

   method to implement, yet reliable to calculate evapotranspiration
   fraction (EF) and surface moisture availability (M-o) from remotely
   sensed imagery of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
   surface radiometric temperature (T-ir). The method is unique in that it
   derives all of its information solely from these two images. As such, it
   does not depend on knowing ancillary surface or atmospheric parameters,
   nor does it require the use of a land surface model. The procedure for
   computing spatiotemporal estimates of these important land surface
   parameters is outlined herein stepwise for practical application by the
   user. Moreover, as the newly developed scheme is not tied to any
   particular sensor, it can also be implemented with technologically
   advanced EO sensors launched recently or planned to be launched such as
   Landsat 8 and Sentinel 3. The latter offers a number of key advantages

   leaching losses. We therefore determined whether N retention could be
   increased by DBSR in order to reduce the risk of N loss to the
   environment. A four-year field experiment and a complementary greenhouse
   experiment were conducted to test the effects of DBSR on N retention in
   a rice-wheat rotation system. We found that DBSR altered the spatial
   distribution of fertilizer N. N content was significantly increased
   above but reduced below the straw layer in the field experiment. The
   greenhouse experiment further confirmed the N retention effects by the
   straw layer. In theory, a maximum of 9.09 mg urea-N could be adsorbed by
   one gram dry wheat straw. Our results suggest that DBSR has the
   potential to increase N retention in the soil, thus increasing crop
   uptake and minimizing leaching N loss in the rice-wheat rotation system.

Abstract = {Maintaining the homogeneity of soil nitrogen (N) and plant vigor across
   agricultural fields is a major concern for farmers and agricultural
   scheme planners, particularly fields that are irrigated through
   pressurized systems, such as center pivots. Therefore, this study was
   carried out on a 30 hm(2) potato field located 650 km south of Riyadh,
   the capital city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to investigate the
   impacts of the center pivot irrigation distribution uniformity on the
   crop development and the spatial distribution of residual soil N.
   Irrigation performance test was designed to investigate water
   application rate and distribution uniformities. The overall water
   application uniformity coefficients (Cu), determined through
   Christiansen (Cud) and Heerman (CuH) methods, were determined at 81.29\%
   and 80.64\%, respectively. However, the overall water distribution
   uniformity (Du) was determined at 70\%. A considerable variability in
   the distribution uniformity of irrigation water was observed across the
   experimental field (a Du value of 67\% over the medium spans compared to
   a Du value of 88\% over the inner spans). Results of this study showed a
   linear correlation between the irrigation water distribution uniformity
   and the soil N (R-2=0.88). On the other hand, the vegetation cover
   distribution, indicated by the Cumulative Normalized Difference
   Vegetation Index (CNDVI), was not found to be much responsive to the
   irrigation distribution uniformity (R-2=0.11). A time series of
   successive NDVI maps extracted throughout the potato crop growth stages
   showed a consistent trend in the distribution of NDVI across the field,
   with R 2 values that ranged between 0.25-0.73.},

Abstract = {In this paper the soil moisture is estimated at airborne level and at
   satellite level by combining remotely sensed images with in situ
   measurements. At airborne level we process high-resolution images
   acquired with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) sensor, and at
   satellite level we compute images acquired with the Advanced Spaceborne
   Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER). The study has been
   accomplished in the framework of two field campaigns in the Barrax
   region (Spain): the SEN2FLEX (SENtinel-2 and FLuorescence EXperiment)
   campaign which was developed in July of 2005 and the SEN3EXP (Sentinel-3
   Experiment) campaign which was carried out in June of 2009. The
   methodology proposed considers the correlation between the surface
   temperature, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the
   emissivity. With this methodology the soil moisture from AHS data can be
   obtained with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.05 m(3)/m(3) compared
   with ground measurements and from ASTER images with a RMSE of 0.06
   m(3)/m(3). (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Leguminous tree species are known to replenish soil nutrients through
   biological N fixation, mulch effect and recycling of other nutrients
   from the deeper soil layer to the topsoil, when managed in agroforestry
   systems. The soil available phosphorus (P) status and inorganic P-forms
   (fractionation) in a long-term gliricidia-maize trial was studied to
   understand the effect of additions of gliricidia prunings combined with
   and without inorganic fertilizers (N and P). Addition of gliricidia
   prunings and inorganic N and P fertilizers significantly increased
   phosphorus uptake by maize. Bray P1 had strong correlation with P uptake
   by maize in gliricidia/maize intercropping (r = 0.81, p < 0.001). Both
   the Olsen and Bray P1 methods of extraction were strongly correlated (r
   = 0.80). Phosphorus fractionation data of the soils from the maize and
   gliricidia-maize plots indicated that the Fe-P fraction was the most
   dominant form of inorganic P. The addition of gliricidia prunings
   significantly reduced the Fe-P and Al-P forms. We conclude that iron
   phosphate acts as a sink for applied inorganic P in Lixisols and the
   increased soil organic matter through addition of gliricidia prunings
   solubilizes fixed P in the soil.},

Abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture is a major interest for several practical
   applications. This task can be suitably performed through various
   methods; however, at the state of the art, there is not a single method
   that successfully combines ease of use, low cost, customization,
   possibility of measuring large volumes, and, most importantly,
   measurement accuracy. In this regard, seismic wave propagation
   (SWP)-based methods, which rely on the evaluation of the propagation
   velocity of a seismic wave v(c) through the soil sample under
   investigation, hold considerable potential for practical implementation.
   On such bases, in this work, first the authors propose an enhanced
   version of a previously developed SWP-based system for soil moisture
   measurement. Successively, to provide an exhaustive performance
   characterization of the system, a specific comparative methodology,
   based on reference time-domain reflectometry (TDR)-based measurements,
   is addressed. More specifically, SWP- and TDR-based measurements are
   simultaneously performed on river sand for increasing levels of water
   content. The TDR-measured moisture levels are taken as reference values
   and are used to infer the theoretical propagation velocity values v(c),
   REF. Then, these reference values are suitably compared with those
   directly measured through the SWP-based system (v(c), MEAS), thus
   allowing a consistent metrological assessment. The ultimate goal of this
   work is to validate and characterize the performance of the proposed
   SWP-based system in view of practical implementation for soil moisture
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {Grass growth and utilisation on grassland farms across the UK and
   Ireland are below their potential, and nutrient management is
   sub-optimal. Excessive soil phosphorus concentrations are an issue,
   contributing to eutrophication of waterways, while sub-optimal soil pH
   due to a reduction in lime use is seen in many areas. This paper
   discusses the potential for introducing technology onto grassland farms,
   and implementing sensible farm-specific management decisions as a means
   of enhancing productivity and minimising the environmental impact of
   livestock fanning. The adoption rate of Precision Agriculture (PA)
   technology by grassland farmers in the UK and Ireland is still
   relatively low, and significantly lagging behind the advances that have
   taken place within the arable farming community. With rapidly advancing
   technology and investment in research, there are now a range of soil
   sensors available along with technology for grass growth monitoring,
   yield mapping, remote sensing, satellite imagery, and devices for
   tracking animal movement, behaviour and feed intake. In this review
   paper we examine the latest technology developments specific to
   grassland farming and we question their suitability and `readiness' for
   adoption by farmers. The review identifies the challenges that are
   specific to grassland such as complex soil, vegetation and climatic
   variables along with economic barriers that may be preventing change
   within the farming community in these areas.},

Abstract = {As an important component of the Earth's ecosystem, soil moisture plays
   a vital role in the global water cycle and serves as an important
   parameter in the study of hydrology, meteorology, and agroecology. Based
   on the energy balance theory of underlying surface, the atmospheric
   temperature data recorded by an automatic weather station as well as
   unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne thermal infrared and multispectral
   remote-sensing data were used to establish inversion models of relative
   soil moisture at different depths based on remote-sensing UAV data and
   date from near-ground quadrats, respectively. Spatial differences and
   data accuracy verification were then performed using the 2017 spring
   wheat moisture data as a control. The results showed that: (1) the
   relative moisture of farmland soil can be effectively estimated using
   the proposed soil moisture inversion model. In terrestrial ecosystems,
   the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, which is often used
   to characterize potential drought levels, is linearly correlated to soil
   moisture at different depths; (2) during the inversion of farmland soil
   moisture, the UAV-based observation method is superior to the
   near-ground quadrat observation method in both efficiency and accuracy.
   In addition, the relative soil moisture estimation model based on UAV
   data has a high accuracy, with R-2 reaching 0.629, and a root mean
   square error (RMSE) of <0.100; and (3) the number and size of quadrats
   are important factors affecting the inversion accuracy. The data
   collected by the UAVs covered a wide range and had high spatial matching
   degree at the field scale. Especially, during estimation of the relative
   moisture of surface soil (0 to 10 and 0 to 20 cm), the linear fitting
   between the inversion model based on UAV data and the measured value was
   optimal. The error was minimal (RMSE <0.07) and R-2 was >0.714, so this
   method is more suitable for estimating and dynamically monitoring
   relative soil moisture of farmland at the field scale. (C) 2018 Society

Abstract = {Previous studies have reported that the trailing shoe application
   technique reduces phosphorus (P) in the runoff post-slurry application
   when compared to the traditional splash-plate application technique.
   However, the effectiveness of the trailing-shoe technique as a means of
   reducing P losses has not been evaluated when slurry is applied during
   periods of high soil moisture levels and lower herbage covers. To
   address this issue, three treatments were examined in a 3 x 4 factorial
   design split-plot experiment, with treatments comprising three slurry
   treatments: control (no slurry), splash-plate and trailing-shoe, and
   four slurry application dates: 7 December, 18 January, 1 March and 10
   April. Dairy cow slurry was applied at a rate of 20 m(3)/ha, while
   simulated runoff was generated 2, 9 and 16 days later and analysed for a
   range of P fractions. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff at
   day two was 41\% lower when slurry was applied using the trailing-shoe
   technique, compared to the splash-plate technique (P < 0.05). In
   addition, P concentrations in runoff were higher (P < 0.05) from slurry
   applied in December and March compared to slurry applied in January or
   April, coinciding with periods of higher soil moisture contents. While
   the latter highlights that `calendar'-based non-spreading periods might
   not always achieve the desired consequences, the study demonstrated that
   further field-scale investigations into the trailing shoe as a
   mitigation measure to reduced P loss from agricultural soils is
   warranted.},

Abstract = {The objective of this letter is to extend the alpha approximation
   method, a method proposed by Balenzano et al., for soil moisture
   retrieval from multitemporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. The
   original alpha approach requires an initial estimate of the upper and
   lower bound soil moisture values to constrain the soil moisture
   retrieval. This letter demonstrates an extension of the alpha approach
   by employing the juxtaposition method to adaptively set the soil
   moisture bounds using the absolute radar backscatter values. This
   extended alpha method was tested using an airborne time series of L-band
   SAR data and coincident ground measurements acquired during the SMAPEx-3
   experiment over bare agricultural fields. The agreement between
   estimated and measured soil moisture values was within a rootmean-square
   error of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) for each of the three polarization
   combinations used (i.e., HH, VV, and HH and VV). Moreover, inclusion of
   the two-polarization combination (HH and VV) slightly improved the
   retrieval performance. The proposed extension to the alpha method makes
   the most of the information contained in the SAR data time series by
   using dynamic, spatially explicit soil moisture bounds retrieved from
   the SAR data themselves.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF APPLIED REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Soil salinization is a common desertification process, especially in
   arid lands. Hyperspectral remote sensing of salinized soil is favored
   for its advantages of being efficient and inexpensive. However, soil
   moisture often jointly has a great influence on the soil reflectance
   spectra under field conditions. It is a challenge to establish a model
   to eliminate the effect of soil moisture and quantitatively estimate the
   salinity contents of slightly and moderately salt-affected soil. A
   controlled laboratory experiment was conducted by way of continuously
   monitoring changes of soil moisture and salt content, which was mainly
   focused on the slightly and moderately salt-affected soil. We
   investigated the external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) method to
   remove the effect of soil moisture (4 to 36\% in weight base) by
   preprocessing soil spectral reflectance and establishing the partial
   least squares regression after EPO preprocessing model (EPO-PLS) to
   predict soil salt content. Through comparing PLS with EPO-PLS model, R-2
   and ratio of prediction to deviation rose from 0.604 and 1.063,
   respectively, to 0.874 and 2.865 for validation data. Root mean square
   error and bias were, respectively, reduced from 1.163 and 0.141 g/100 g
   to 0.718 and 0.044 g/100 g. The performance of the model after EPO
   algorithm preprocessing was improved significantly. (C) 2016 Society of

Abstract = {In order to assess the changes in soil K pools as affected by
   K-fertilizer application and the impact of the changes on K balance,
   grain yield, and K uptake, an experiment was conducted in Central
   Zhejiang Province, E China, in a continuous double-cropping rice system.
   Two sites were selected: (1) the Agricultural Research Institute of
   Jinhua (ARI) where soil is calcareous and (2) the Shimen Research Farm
   (SM) where soil is acidic. Eight consecutive crops were grown
   (1997-2000) in ARI and five consecutive crops (1998-2000) at SM.
   Treatments included unfertilized control (CK) and three different
   fertilizer treatments (NP, NK, and NPK). Potassium extracted by
   ion-exchange resin decreased from 26 mg kg(-1) to 5-10 mg kg(-1) after
   eight consecutive seasons of growth at the ARI site. Addition of 100 kg
   K ha(-1) for each rice crop was not enough to maintain initial K
   availability, especially in the calcareous soil at ARI site. In
   treatments with K, a small increase in readily available K was observed
   only in SM soil. The K extracted by HNO3 also decreased significantly in
   the treatments without K addition and was increased slightly in the

   HNO3-K was several times greater than resin-K, indicating that
   nonexchangeable K may be the major source of K supply to rice. Soil K
   depletion was greater for hybrid rice than for inbred rice, and this
   difference in K demand should be taken into account in developing
   fertilizer recommendations for irrigated rice.},

Abstract = {Electrical image data were used to estimate soil moisture content
   beneath smectite-dominated black Vertosol in the Liverpool Plains
   catchment in northern New South Wales. Measurements carried out over a
   range of soil moisture conditions included: water use by lucerne sown
   into a full pro. le, recharge of profiles after lucerne and long fallow
   after a cereal crop. Measurements were repeated approximately every 2
   months between September 2000 and August 2001. Estimates of bulk
   electrical conductivity (EC), determined from inversion of apparent
   conductivity electrical images, were compared to soil moisture
   measurements made using neutron access tubes. A correlation of 0.77 (n =
   228, P< 0.0001) between the 2 datasets indicates that electrical imaging
   can be used to satisfactorily predict bulk moisture content in soils of
   this type. Interpretation of the bulk EC images indicates drying of the
   soil profile to 6 m depth beneath lucerne.},

Title = {Soil phosphorus fractionation as a tool for monitoring dust phosphorus
   signature underneath a Blue Pine (<i>Pinus wallichiana</i>) canopy in a
   Temperate Forest},
Journal = {FOREST SYSTEMS},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {25},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Aim of the study: This study aims (i) to monitor the amount of dust
   deposition during dry season in the moist temperate forest; (ii) to
   study nature of P fractions in the dust samples falling on the trees in
   the region; (iii) to study soil P fractions as influenced by the
   processes of throughfall and stemflow of a Blue Pine (Pinus wallichiana)
   canopy and to finger print the contribution of dust towards P input in
   the temperate forest ecosystem.
   Area of study: The site used for the collection of soil samples was
   situated at an elevation of 6900 feet above sea level (temperate forest
   in Himalaya region) in the Thandani area national forest located in the
   north west of Pakistan.
   Material and methods: For soil sampling and processing, three forest
   sites with three old tree plants per site were selected at approximately
   leveled plain for surface soil sampling. Two dust samples were collected
   and analyzed for different physicochemical properties along with
   different P fractions. First dust sample was collected from a site
   situated at an elevation of 4000 feet and second one was collected from
   an elevation of 6500 feet above sea levels. Modified Hedley procedure
   for the fractionation of P in the dust and soil samples were used.
   Main results: The input of dust was 43 and 20 kg ha(-1) during drier
   months of the year (September-June) at lower and higher elevation sites
   respectively, and the dust from lower elevation site had relative more
   all P fractions than the other dust sample. However, HCl-P-i fraction
   was dominant in both samples. Both labile (water plus NaHCO3) and
   non-labile (NaOH plus HCl) inorganic P (P-i) fractions were
   significantly increased in the surface soil by both stemflow and
   throughfall compared to the open field soil. The buildup of NaOH and
   HCl-P-i pools in soils underneath the canopy might prove useful in
   fingerprinting the contribution of atmospheric dust towards P cycling in
   this temperate forest.
   Research highlights: The role of dust in the cycling of P in temperate
   forest in Himalaya region.},

Title = {Block Kriging With Measurement Errors: A Case Study of the Spatial
   Prediction of Soil Moisture in the Middle Reaches of Heihe River Basin},
Journal = {IEEE GEOSCIENCE AND REMOTE SENSING LETTERS},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {87-91},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Block kriging (BK) is a common method of predicting the true value at
   the pixel scale when validating remote sensing retrieval products.
   However, measurement errors (MEs) increase the prediction uncertainty.
   In this letter, an extended interpolation technique-BK with MEs
   (BKMEs)-is developed. The properties of BKME are proven through
   derivation and demonstrated in a case study of soil moisture (SM)
   upscaling. Three prediction scenarios-one without MEs (BK), BK with
   homogeneous MEs (BKHOME), and BK with heterogeneous MEs (BKHEME)-are
   considered for the upscaling of SM data observed by a distributed
   wireless sensor network, and the results are compared. Both BK and
   BKHOME yield the same upscaling results, which differ from those of
   BKHEME, and the prediction results of BKHEME show less bias than those
   of the other scenarios. Because both BKHOME and BKHEME consider MEs,
   their prediction results show smaller kriging variances than do the BK
   results. Three primary conclusions are drawn. The first is that the
   optimal kriging coefficients assigned to the observations are affected
   not only by spatial distance but also by the MEs when the MEs of the
   samples are unequal. The second is that when the MEs are equal, it may
   not be necessary to consider the MEs to predict the value for an
   unobserved location. The third is that although the prediction
   uncertainty can be reduced by considering MEs, it is more meaningful to
   consider unequal MEs than equal MEs in the prediction process. BKME is
   an advanced upscaling method that achieves improved prediction accuracy
   by considering MEs.},

Title = {Long-term effects of controlled release urea application on crop yields
   and soil fertility under rice-oilseed rape rotation system},
Journal = {FIELD CROPS RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {65-73},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has played an important role in increasing rice
   and oilseed rape yields, but more than half of the N fertilizer applied
   into the field has been lost and results in not only an environmental
   hazard but also a substantial economic loss. Thus, the controlled
   release N fertilizer was expected to reduce the labor cost from
   fertilizer dressing, to the convenience of fertilizers application and
   to increase N use efficiency. A 7-year field fertilization experiment
   applied controlled-release urea (CRU) 100\% (180 kg ha(-1)), 70\% (126
   kg ha(-1)) and 50\% (90 kg ha(-1)) of the recommended N fertilizer to
   explore its effects on crops yield and soil fertility under the rice
   (Oryza sativa L.)-oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) rotation system in
   Hubei province of China. Meanwhile the equivalent rates of N as common
   urea were supplied as split applications in different growth stages as
   the control. The N release characteristic of CRU in field condition was
   closely matched to the demand for N during the whole growth periods of
   crops. Consequently, the CRU treatments achieved significantly higher
   rice and oilseed rape yield by 6.1-8.2\% and 6.3-15.5\%, the mean
   nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of CRU treatments was increased by
   15.4-38.4\%, and the average annual net profit was also increased by
   16.0-20.8\%, compared with urea treatment at the same N rate. For each
   type of N fertilizer, the yield increased as the input N rate increased.
   However, reducing CRU rate by 30\% produced the same yield of rice and
   oilseed rape as with the 100\% rate of urea. And, the rice yield of
   CRU50\% treatment was even showed no significant with Ureal 00\%
   treatment. The contents of nitrate N (NO3--N) and ammonium N (NH4{*}-N)
   were higher in 0-40 cm soil of CRU treatments than urea treatments over
   7-year fertilization in 2013, but the opposite trend was found in 60-100
   cm soil, which indicating that CRU decreased the NO3--N and NH4+-N
   leaching to deep in the soil. The contents of total N and organic matter
   were increased by applying CRU for 7 years compared with urea
   fertilizer. Although the contents of available P and K were increased
   over the 7 years of fertilization and cultivation, no prominent
   difference was observed between CRU70\% and Ureal 00\%. The results
   suggest that a 30\% decrease in the recommended application rate of N is
   possible with CRU while maintaining the same yield, preserving the soil
   fertility and also labor/time-saving. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {A long-term field experiment was conducted at the research farm of the
   All-India Coordinated Research Project for Dryland Agriculture,
   Phulbani, Orissa, India, from 2001 to 2006 to identify the best
   integrated nutrient-use treatments for ensuring greater productivity,
   profitability, sustainability, and improved soil quality in pigeon pea +
   rice (two rows of pigeon pea followed by five rows of rice alternately)
   intercropping system. In all, nine treatments, eight comprising
   integrated nutrient-use practices, chemical fertilizer (CF), farmyard
   manure (FYM), and green leaf manure (GLM) to supply nitrogen (N) at 45
   kg N ha(-1) and one farmer's practice equivalent to 25 kg N ha(-1) (FYM
   5 t ha(-1)), were tested on a long-term basis. Results of the study
   revealed that 20 kg N ha(-1) (FYM) + 25 kg N (CF) gave maximum mean rice
   grain yield of 1.52 t ha(-1), followed by 20 kg N (GLM) + 25 kg N (urea)
   with grain yield of 1.51 t ha(-1). In the case of pigeon pea, 30 kg N
   (FYM) + 15 kg N (urea) gave maximum pigeon pea grain yield of 0.94 t
   ha(-1), which was 34\% greater than the sole application of chemical
   fertilizer. Pigeon pea grain yield tended to increase with increasing
   proportion of organic N in FYM + CF or GLM + CF combinations.
   Application of 20 kg N (FYM) + 25 kg N (urea) recorded maximum mean rice
   equivalent yield of 3.59 t ha(-1) and sustainability yield index of
   59\%. While studying profitability, application of 20 kg N (FYM)+ 25 kg
   N (CF) gave maximum net returns of US\$168.94 ha(-1). Impact of
   treatments on soil quality as assessed in terms of relative soil quality
   indices (RSQI) increased with increasing proportion of organic sources
   of N. Using an innovative and new approach, an index of integrated
   productivity-sustainability-profitability-soil quality performance index
   (I-P,I-S,I-Pr,I-SQ) was computed to make a precise evaluation of the
   treatments. Based on this index, the order of performance of the
   treatments was T-6 {[}20 N (FYM) + 25 N (CF)] (7.7) > T-7 {[}30 N (FYM)
   + 15 N (CF) (6.9)] > T-3 {[}20 N (GL) + 25 N (CF)] (6.8) > T-5 {[}10 N

   T-1 {[}FYM at 5 t ha(-1)] (4.1). Thus, the results and the methodology
   adopted in this study using long-term data would be very useful to
   researchers, farmers, land managers, and other stakeholders not only in

Abstract = {We investigated the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 and air
   temperature on C cycling in trees and associated soil system, focusing
   on canopy CO2 assimilation (A(sys)) and system CO2 loss through
   respiration (R-sys). We hypothesized that both elevated CO2 and elevated
   temperature would stimulate A(sys) and R-sys. The study was conducted in
   sun-lit controlled-environment mesocosms using Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga
   menziesii Mirb. Franco) seedlings grown in reconstructed
   plant-litter-soil systems. A completely randomized design with two
   atmospheric CO2 and two air temperature levels was used. A mass-balance
   approach was used to calculate daily mean A(sys) and R-sys rates for 19
   months. A mixed model analysis was used to test the effects of CO2 and
   air temperature on daily A(sys) and R-sys adjusted for covariates of
   time, light, soil moisture and seasonality. Elevated temperature
   stimulated A(sys) and R-sys but elevated CO2 did not. Elevated CO2 and
   temperature both increased light sensitivity and the light saturation
   level of photosynthesis. Both A(sys) and R-sys were controlled by
   temperature, soil moisture and endogenous seasonal processes.
   Temperature sensitivity of R-sys varied seasonally but there was no
   acclimatization. Because of the close linkage between assimilation and
   respiration, elevated CO2 failed to stimulate A(sys) and R-sys. Although
   CO2 is a substrate, assimilate is also controlled by its concentration.
   Needle-level studies established that increasing CO2 down regulates
   assimilation through changes in Rubisco, especially if resources are
   limited. This study shows that increasing CO2 also regulates
   assimilation allometrically through changes in needle area. Stimulation
   of assimilation is offset by a reduction in needle area such that the

Title = {Numerical assisted assessment of vadose-zone nitrogen transport under a
   soil moisture controlled wastewater SDI dispersal system in a Vertisol},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING},

Volume = {53},
Pages = {228-234},

Abstract = {A real-time soil moisture controlled wastewater SDI dispersal system was
   tested in a Vertisol for approximately one year to regulate soil
   nitrogen from an artificially prepared septic effluent. The control
   strategy was to allow wastewater hydraulic disposal only when the drain
   field moisture level was near field capacity. Due to limited field
   sampling and resulting uncertainty in rate of field
   nitrification/denitrification, numerical simulation (HYDRUS 2D) was
   utilized to assess system control over nitrogen concentrations in the
   drain field. Using nitrification/denitrification rates estimated from
   cumulative frequency distributions (CFD), simulated drain field moisture
   levels were found statistically lower than actual field observations
   over the entire year, suggesting persistent drain field soil swelling
   which is theoretically favorable to denitrification. Short- and
   long-term simulations suggest that denitrification level should be 50\%
   higher than 50\% CFD (first-order reaction, 0.042 day(-1)). Although no
   conclusive results are presented, this study indicates a potential
   management approach that favors denitrification by regulating nitrogen
   application using soil moisture. Further study is required to optimize
   soil moisture to increase wastewater hydraulic disposal while
   restricting nitrogen concentrations within the managed soil horizon. (C)

Abstract = {Cover crop spring kill date and species affect spring water use by
   covers, summer moisture conservation by cover crop residue, and yield of
   subsequent corn (Zea mays L.). Data are needed on spring management
   strategies for cover crop mixtures of hairy vetch (HV) (Vicia villosa
   Roth) and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), compared to pure stands, to
   make accurate corn fertilizer nitrogen (FN) recommendations and to
   optimize moisture use vs. conservation by cover crop mixtures. A 2-yr
   study evaluated a grass-selective herbicide (GSH) applied in late March
   to a pure rye cover and a vetch-rye mixture, allowing the vetch to
   accumulate N until early May. These treatments were compared to early
   May-killed pure rye, pure vetch, vetch-rye mixture, and no-cover
   control. Corn FN rates of 0, 45, 90, 180, and 270 kg ha(-1) were applied
   in June. Corn grain yield was greater following pure stands of vetch
   than following any other cover crop treatment, regardless of kill date.
   The average economic optimum FN rate was about 150 kg N ha(-1) without a
   cover. With a cover crop and compared to the control, the hairy vetch
   replaced about 80 kg FN ha(-1), the vetch-rye mixture replaced about 15
   kg FN ha(-1), while the pure rye removed an additional 50 kg FN ha(-1).
   Spring soil moisture (0-20 cm) beneath growing covers was greater than
   or equal to the no-cover controls throughout the spring and the summer.
   There was no significant difference in corn FN response for the early
   kill date of rye with a GSH, compared with the conventional late-kill
   date.},

Title = {An improved method for estimating global evapotranspiration based on
   satellite determination of surface net radiation, vegetation index,
   temperature, and soil moisture},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {A simple and accurate method to estimate regional or global latent heat
   of evapotranspiration (ET) from remote sensing data is essential. The
   authors proposed a method in an earlier study that utilized
   satellite-determined surface net radiation (R-n), a vegetation index,
   and daytime-averaged/daily maximum air temperature (T-a) or land surface
   temperature (T-s) data. However, the influence of soil moisture (SM) on
   ET was not considered and is addressed in this paper by incorporating
   the diurnal T-s range (DTsR). ET, measured by the energy balance Bowen
   ratio method at eight enhanced facility sites on the southern Great
   Plains in the United States and by the eddy covariance method at four
   AmeriFlux sites during 2001-06, is used to validate the improved method.
   Site land cover varies from grassland, native prairie, and cropland to
   deciduous forest and evergreen forest. The correlation coefficient
   between the measured and predicted 16-day daytime-averaged ET using a
   combination of R-n, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), daily maximum T-s,
   and DTsR is about 0.92 for all the sites, the bias is-1.9 W m(-2), and
   the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 28.6 W m(-2). The sensitivity of
   the revised method to input data error is small. Implemented here is the
   revised method to estimate global ET using diurnal T-a range (DTaR)
   instead of DTsR because DTsR data are not available yet, although
   DTaR-estimated ET is less accurate than DTsR-estimated ET. Global
   monthly ET is calculated from 1986 to 1995 at a spatial resolution of 1
   degrees x 1 degrees from the International Satellite Land Surface
   Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II global interdisciplinary
   monthly dataset and is compared with the 15 land surface model
   simulations of the Global Soil Wetness Project-2. The results of the
   comparison of 118 months of global ET show that the bias is 4.5 W m(-2),
   the RMSE is 19.8 W m(-2), and the correlation coefficient is 0.82.
   Incorporating DTaR distinctively improves the accuracy of the estimate
   of global ET.},

Abstract = {Stable isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen are often used to determine plant
   water uptake depths. We investigated whether and to what extend soil
   moisture, clay content, and soil calcium carbonate influences the water
   isotopic composition.
   In the laboratory, dried soil samples varying in clay content were
   rewetted with different amounts of water of known isotopic composition.
   Further, we removed soil carbonate from a subset of samples prior to
   rewetting. Water was extracted from samples via cryogenic vacuum
   extraction and analysed by mass spectrometry.
   The isotopic composition of extracted soil water was similarly depleted
   in both O-18 and H-2 with decreasing soil moisture and increasing clay
   and carbonate content. Soil carbonate changed the delta O-18 composition
   while delta H-2 was not affected.
   Our results indicate that soil carbonate can cause artifacts for O-18
   isotopic composition of soil water. At low soil moisture and high
   carbonate content this could lead to conflicting results for delta O-18
   and delta H-2 in plant water uptake studies.},

Abstract = {High concentrations of nutrients in surface soil present a risk of
   nutrient movement into waterways through surface water pathways and
   leaching. Phosphorus (P) is of particular concern because of its role in
   aquatic system eutrophication. We measured nutrients under annual
   pastures on a beef farm and a dairy farm in the Peel-Harvey catchment,
   Western Australia. Soils were sampled in 10-mm increments to 100 mm
   depth in March, June and September. Plant litter contained approximately
   300-550 mg kg(-1) Colwell-extractable P. Extractable soil P was strongly
   stratified, being approximately 100-225 mg kg(-1) (dairy) and 50-110 mg
   kg(-1) (beef) in the top 10 mm and <40 mg kg(-1) at 40-50 mm depth.
   Total P and extractable potassium were also highly stratified, whereas
   sulfur was less strongly stratified. Shoot nutrient concentrations
   indicated that nitrogen was often limiting and sulfur was sometimes
   limiting for pasture growth: concentrations of P were often much greater
   than required for adequate growth (>4 mg g(-1)). We conclude that high P
   concentrations at the soil surface and in litter and shoots are a source
   of risk for movement of P from farms into waterways in the Peel-Harvey

Abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) estimates are important to research, but are not
   accurately predictable in areas with tall vegetation. Full-polarization
   Radarsat-2 C-band data were used to retrieve SM contents using typical
   polarization decomposition (Freeman-Durden, Yamaguchi and VanZly) at
   different growth stages of maize. Applicability analyses were conducted,
   including proportion, regression and surface scattering model analyses.
   Furthermore, the Bragg, the extended Bragg scattering model (X-Bragg)
   and improved surface scattering models (ISSM) were used to retrieve SM
   content. The results indicated that the VanZly decomposition method was
   the best. The proportion of surface scattering in the proportion
   analysis was highest (> 52\%), followed by that in the Yamaguchi method
   (> 41\%). The R2 (> 0.6144) between surface scattering and SM was
   significantly higher (R-2 < 0.4484) between dihedral scattering and SM
   in the regression analysis. The ISSM was better at different maize
   growth stages than the Bragg and X-Bragg models with a higher R-2 (>
   0.6599) and lower absolute error (AE) (< 5.82) and root mean square
   error ( RMSE) (< 3.73). The best algorithm was obtained at the sowing
   stage (R-2 = 0.8843, AE = 3.13, RMSE = 1.76). In addition, the X-Bragg
   model provided better approximation of actual surface scattering without
   the measured data (better algorithm: R2 = 0.8314, AE = 4.39, RMSE =
   2.81).},

Abstract = {Intercomparisons of microwave-based soil moisture products from active
   ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and passive AMSR-E (Advanced Microwave
   Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System) is conductedbased
   onsurface soil moisture (SSM) simulations from the eco-hydrological
   model, Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP), after it is carefully
   validated with in situ measurements over the North China Plain.
   Correlations with VIP SSM simulation are generally satisfactory with
   average values of 0.71 for ASCAT and 0.47 for AMSR-E during 2007-2009.
   ASCAT and AMSR-E present unbiased errors of 0.044 and 0.053 m(3) m(-3)
   on average, with respect to model simulation. The empirical orthogonal
   functions (EOF) analysis results illustrate that AMSR-E provides more
   consistent SSM spatial structure with VIP than ASCAT; while ASCAT is
   more capable of capturing SSM temporal dynamics. This is supported by
   the facts that ASCAT has more consistent expansion coefficients
   corresponding to primary EOF mode with VIP (R=0.825, p<0.1). However,
   comparison based on SSM anomaly demonstrates that AMSR-E and ASCAT have
   similar skill in capturing SSM short-term variability. Temporal analysis
   of SSM anomaly time series shows that AMSR-E provides best performance
   in autumn, while ASCAT provides lower anomaly bias during
   highly-vegetated summer with vegetation optical depth of 0.61. Moreover,
   ASCAT retrieval accuracy is less influenced by vegetation cover, as it
   is in relatively better agreement with VIP simulation in forest than in
   other land-use types and exhibits smaller interannual fluctuation than
   AMSR-E. Identification of the error characteristics of these two
   microwave soil moisture data sets will be helpful for correctly
   interpreting the data products and also facilitate optimal specification
   of the error matrix in data assimilation at a regional scale.},

   in increasing total soil nitrogen},
Journal = {SOIL \& TILLAGE RESEARCH},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {118},
Pages = {32-39},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Tillage treatments had impact on total soil nitrogen (N) storage and
   consequently on soil carbon (C) sequestration. The objective of this
   study was to assess effects of long-term (1992-2010) tillage practices,
   including a partial-width tillage system (paraplow) on N concentration
   and stratification. The tillage treatments were: no-tillage (NT),
   minimum tillage (18-22 cm depth) with chisel plow (MT), conventional
   tillage (25-30 cm depth) with mouldboard plow (CT) and zone-tillage
   subsoiling (25-30 cm) with a paraplow (ZT) applied in alternate years in
   rotation with NT. The soil was a Calcic Haploxeralf from Central Spain.
   The crop rotation was chick pea (Cicer arietinun L.) cv.
   Inmaculada/barley (Hordeum vulgare L) cv. Volley. The equivalent mass
   approach was used to compare N stocks in the various tillage methods.
   Tillage treatments had significant effects on soil bulk density and
   no-till increased soil bulk density of the top layer. At the end of 19
   years, the stocks of N had increased under NT compared with MT and CT.
   Most changes occurred within the 0-5 cm layer, where plots under NT had
   0.48 Mg N ha(-1) and 0.53 Mg N ha(-1) greater than in MT and CT,
   respectively. Zone tillage maintained most of the long-term benefit of
   NT in increasing N stocks in the top layer (0-5 cm). At the end of the
   experiment, total N concentration in the 0-5 cm depth under ZT was 42\%
   and 53\% higher that under MT and CT, respectively. Stratification
   ratios of N from 1992 to 2000 showed no significant differences between
   NT, MT and CT. In contrast, from 2001 onwards, all stratification ratios
   were significantly higher in NT than in the other two tillage systems.
   In addition, in 2010 the stratification ratio of N in NT was >2 and more
   than 2-fold those obtained in MT and CT. Values of stratification ratios
   under ZT followed the same trend than under NT and were significantly
   greater than under MT or CT. These greater stratification ratios of N
   observed under NT and ZT confirm, in the soil studied, not only the
   benefits associated with the long-term application of no-till in
   increasing total N in the top layer, but also the positive impact of the
   use of a paraplow as a rotational tillage system. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {An experiment with the free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) method
   was conducted in a paddy field at Wuxi (Jiangsu Province, China) to
   study effects of elevated atmospheric {[}CO2] on availability of soil
   nitrogen and phosphorus. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) and winter wheat
   (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown under ambient CO2 or FACE (ambient +
   200 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) conditions throughout the growth season. Low N
   (LN) and normal N (NN) were applied, LN being 150 kg ha(-1) for rice and
   125 kg ha(-1) for wheat and NN being 250 kg ha(-1) for both rice and
   wheat.
   Compared with the ambient {[}CO2] condition, elevated {[}CO2]
   significantly increased crop biomass and P uptake for both rice and
   wheat and N uptake only for wheat at several main growth stages. The
   positive effects of elevated {[}CO2] on biomass, N and P uptake of wheat
   were greater than of rice.
   Soil available N was decreased by elevated {[}CO2] by 47\% in LN and
   29\% in NN at the rice tillering stage at jointing stage and decreased
   by 25.4\% and 28.3\% in LN and by 33.3\% and 53.1\% in NN at the wheat

   affected significantly by elevated {[}CO2] at each stage.
   These results suggest that under elevated {[}CO2] availability of soil N
   and P increased, particularly P and application of N and P should be
   adjusted to need for rice at tillering and jointing and for wheat at
   whole growth stages. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {We describe here a study based on analysis of vegetation indices and
   land surface temperatures, which provides relevant information for
   estimating soil moisture at regional scales. Through an analysis of
   MODIS satellite imagery and in situ moisture data, the triangle method
   was used to develop a conceptual land surface temperature-vegetation
   index model, and spatial temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI)
   values to describe soil moisture relationships for a broad landscape.
   This study was situated mainly within two states of the southern United
   States (Georgia and South Carolina). The total study area was about 30
   million hectares. The analyses were conducted using information gathered
   from the 2009 growing season (from the end of March to September). The
   results of the study showed that soil moisture content was inversely
   proportional to TVDI, and that TVDI based on the normalized difference
   vegetation index (NDVI) had a slightly higher correlation with soil
   moisture than TVDI based on the enhanced vegetation index (EVI).},

Abstract = {In the past few decades, there have been great developments in remotely
   sensed soil moisture, with validation efforts using land surface models
   (LSMs) and ground-based measurements, because soil moisture information
   is essential to understanding complex land surfaceatmosphere
   interactions. However, the validation of remotely sensed soil moisture
   has been very limited because of the scarcity of the ground measurements
   in Korea. This study validated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E
   (AMSR-E) soil moisture data with the Common Land Model (CLM), one of the
   most widely used LSMs, and ground-based measurements at two Korean
   regional flux monitoring network sites. There was reasonable agreement
   regarding the different soil moisture products for monitoring temporal
   trends except National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) AMSR-E soil
   moisture, albeit there were essential comparison limitations by
   different spatial scales and soil depths. The AMSR-E soil moisture data
   published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Vrije
   Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) showed potential to replicate temporal
   variability patterns (root-mean-square errors = 0.100.14 m(3) m(-3) and
   wet BIAS = 0.09 - 0.04 m(3) m(-3)) with the CLM and ground-based
   measurements. However, the NSIDC AMSR-E soil moisture was problematic
   because of the extremely low temporal variability and the VUA AMSR-E
   soil moisture was relatively inaccurate in Gwangneung site characterized
   by complex geophysical conditions. Additional evaluations should be
   required to facilitate the use of recent and forthcoming remotely sensed
   soil moisture data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil
   Moisture Active and Passive missions at representative future validation
   sites. Copyright (c) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {High spatio-temporal resolution mapping of soil moisture by integrating
   wireless sensor network observations and MODIS apparent thermal inertia
   in the Babao River Basin, China},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {191},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Soil moisture distributions with high spatio-temporal resolution are
   scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and
   closing the water cycle at the basin scale. Sensor networks are
   innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity
   and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly
   derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. A
   Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes MODIS-derived apparent
   thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with
   a resolution of 1 km in the Babao River Basin, China. The 2-4 cm soil
   moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations
   located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed
   to validate the mapping algorithm. The correlation coefficient and
   unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) averaged 0.880 and 0.031
   cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation
   accuracy. The 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a
   resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 Soil Moisture and
   Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) soil moisture product. The results show
   that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to
   complex topography, the SMOS soil moisture is generally lower than that
   of the upscaling results. Semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal
   function (EOF) analysis are used to analyze the space-time
   heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. In the summer,
   rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a
   complex spatial structure. After the rainy season, the spatial
   heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as
   soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. From the perspective of
   temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined
   seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from
   August to October. Because more rain falls in the summer due to the
   mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more
   pronounced over 20\% of the area compared to that in other regions.
   Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling
   method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to
   analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

   soil nutrient management practices in soybean- wheat system of central
   India},

Abstract = {Soil nutrient management is a key component contributing to the
   greenhouse gas (GHG) flux and mitigation potential of agricultural
   production systems. However, the effect of soil nutrient management
   practices on GHG flux and global warming potential (GWP) is less
   understood in agricultural soils of India. The present study was
   conducted to compare three nutrient management systems practiced for
   nine consecutive years in a soybean-wheat cropping system in the
   Vertisols of India, in terms of GHG flux and GWP. The treatments were
   composed of 100\% organic (ONM), 100\% inorganic (NPK), and integrated
   nutrient management (INM) with 50\% organic + 50\% inorganic inputs. The
   gas samples for GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) were collected by static
   chamber method at about 15-day interval during 2012-13 growing season.
   The change in soil organic carbon (SOC) content was estimated in terms
   of the changes in SOC stock in the 0-15 cm soil over the 9-year period
   covering 2004 to 2013. There was a net uptake of CH4 in all the
   treatments in both soybean and wheat crop seasons. The cumulative N2O
   and CO2 emissions were in the order of INM > ONM > NPK with significant
   difference between treatments (p < 0.05) in both the crop seasons. The
   annual GWP, expressed in terms of CH4 and N2O emission, also followed
   the same trend and was estimated to be 1126, 1002, and 896 kg CO2 eq
   ha(-1) yea(r-1) under INM, ONM, and NPK treatments, respectively.
   However, the change in SOC stock was significantly higher under ONM
   (1250 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) followed by INM (417 kg ha(-1) year-1) and
   least under NPK (198 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) treatment. The wheat equivalent
   yield was similar under ONM and INM treatments and was significantly
   lower under NPK treatment. Thus, the GWP per unit grain yield was lower
   under ONM followed by NPK and INM treatments and varied from 250, 261,
   and 307 kg CO2 eq Mg-1 grain yield under ONM, NPK, and INM treatments,
   respectively.},

   system},

Year = {2015},
Volume = {154},
Pages = {208-215},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {Over a 3-year period, the effect of differing N-application regimes on
   soil extractable-P concentration, soil phosphatase activity, and forage
   P uptake in a P-enriched grazed-pasture system was investigated. In the
   fall of each year, six 0.28-ha plots were overseeded with triticale (x
   Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.) and crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum)
   into a tall fescue (Lolium arundinacea)/bermudagrass (Cynodon dactylon)
   sod and assigned to 1 of 3 N-fertilizer treatments (n = 2): 100\% of N
   recommendation in a split application (100N), 50\% in a single
   application (50N), and 0\% of N recommendation (ON) for triticale.
   Cattle commenced grazing the following spring and grazed until May. In
   the summer, plots were overseeded with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata),
   fertilized at the same rates by reference to N recommendations for
   bermudagrass, and grazed by cattle until September. There were no
   effects of N fertilization on soil phosphatase activity, electrical
   conductivity, or concentrations of water-soluble P. Concentrations of
   extractable P decreased in plots receiving 50N, but increasing N
   fertilization to 100N resulted in no further reduction in extractable P.
   Forage biomass, foliar P concentrations, and forage P mass were not
   affected by N fertilization rates at the plant-community level, but
   responses were observed within individual forage species. Results are
   interpreted to mean that N fertilization at 50\% of the agronomic
   recommendation for the grass component can increase forage P mass of
   specific forages and decrease soil extractable P, thus providing
   opportunity for decreasing P losses from grazed pasture. (C) 2015

Title = {Extension of cosmic-ray neutron probe measurement depth for improving
   field scale root-zone soil moisture estimation by coupling with
   representative in-situ sensors},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {571},

Abstract = {Accurate estimation of field-scale root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is
   essential for hydro-meteorological and agricultural management. The
   cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is an innovative technique for
   field-scale soil moisture observation. However, it is limited at deeper
   depths, and requires suitable methods for scaling the CRNP effective
   depth to represent the root-zone layer (up to 100 cm depth). A merging
   framework was developed in this study for improving field-scale RZSM
   with the CRNP via coupling the representative ancillary RZSM information
   with cosmic-ray soil moisture. By using ancillary RZSM retrieved at the
   most time stable location, this approach alleviates the problems
   associated with lack of independent datasets, while maintaining scale
   representativeness. A linear autoregressive model was adopted to
   forecast the errors between two input datasets (the cosmic-ray soil
   moisture and ancillary RZSM) and a reference product, which was computed
   by spatially weighting the deepest in-situ soil moisture measurements
   apart from the most time stable location. The variances of estimated
   errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single
   product by following the original linear combination of forecasts, and
   subsequently merging the ancillary RZSM and cosmic-ray soil moisture.
   Performance of the merged RZSM in comparison to input datasets and
   exponential filter-based RZSM over three different environments was
   evaluated against the reference RZSM product. The results indicated that
   differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and
   belowground biomass accumulation, root water uptake rate and canopy
   density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in
   merged RZSM, and they can be partly interpreted via the framework
   procedure. Superior performance achieved by the merging framework
   demonstrated its robustness in improving field-scale RZSM measurement
   compared to other products. This study also underlines the strong
   relationship between input data quality and the performance of the
   selected merging method, with respect to variations of CRNP effective
   depths. Overall, the merging framework is simple to apply, enables
   unrestricted-use in different environments, and is flexible to combine
   further standalone data sources.},

   Using GPR},
Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {9},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {At radar frequencies below 2 GHz, the mismatch between the 5 to 15 cm
   sensing depth of classical time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe soil
   moisture measurements and the radar penetration depth can easily lead to
   unreliable in situ data. Accurate quantitative measurements of soil
   water contents at various depths by classical methods are cumbersome and
   usually highly invasive. We propose an improved method for the
   estimation of vertical soil moisture profiles from multi-offset ground
   penetrating radar (GPR) data. A semi-automated data acquisition
   technique allows for very fast and robust measurements in the field.
   Advanced common mid-point (CMP) processing is applied to obtain
   quantitative estimates of the permittivity and depth of the reflecting
   soil layers. The method is validated against TDR measurements using data
   acquired in different environments. Depth and soil moisture contents of
   the reflecting layers were estimated with root mean square errors (RMSE)
   on the order of 5 cm and 1.9 Vol.-\%, respectively. Application of the
   proposed technique for the validation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR)
   soil moisture estimates is demonstrated based on a case study using
   airborne L-band data and ground-based P-band data. For the L-band case
   we found good agreement between the near-surface GPR estimates and
   extended integral equation model ((IEM)-E-2) based SAR retrievals,
   comparable to those obtained by TDR. At the P-band, the GPR based method
   significantly outperformed the TDR method when using soil moisture
   estimates at depths below 30 cm.},

Abstract = {Enrichment of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks through sequestration of
   atmospheric CO2 in agricultural soils is important because of its
   impacts on soil quality, agronomic production, and adaptation to and
   mitigation of climate change. In a 21-yr field experiment conducted
   under subhumid tropical conditions in India, the impacts of crop residue
   C inputs were assessed for the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-lentil (Lens
   esculenta Moench) cropping sequence. These impacts were evaluated in an
   experiment involving mineral fertilizers and manuring treatments on crop
   yield sustainability with reference to critical biomass requirements for
   maintenance of SOC in an Inceptisol. Application of farmyard manure
   (FYM) without and with mineral fertilizers increased C input and SOC
   concentration and stock. In comparison with the control, the 100\%
   organic (FYM) treatment had significantly higher profile SOC (27.5 Mg
   ha(-1)), and more C build up (55.0\%) and C sequestration (6.6 Mg C
   ha(-1)) to 1-m depth vis-a-vis the antecedent values in 1986. These
   parameters were also higher in 100\% FYM treatment at a rate providing
   equivalent amount of the recommended dose of N followed by conjunctive
   use of FYM and mineral fertilizers. The SOC stock and rate of
   sequestration were positively correlated with cumulative C input, and
   with sustainable yield index (SYI) of upland rice and lentil. Higher
   grain yield (1.95 and 1.04 Mg ha(-1) of rice and lentil, respectively)
   was obtained with the application of 50\% organic (FYM)+50\% recommended
   dose of fertilizer (RDF). In comparison, higher SOC sequestration rate
   was measured with the application of 100\% organic (FYM). For every Mg
   increase in SOC stock in the root zone there was 0.16 and 0.18 Mg
   ha(-1)yr(-1) yield increase of rice and lentil, respectively. For
   maintaining a stable SOC level (zero change due to cropping), a minimum
   quantity of 2.47 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) is required for this soil, climate,
   cropping system, and fertilization treatments. To achieve this quantity
   of C, 7.1 Mg of biomass is required to be produced every year vs.
   average rice and lentil yields of 1.6 and 0.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively.
   The sole application of mineral fertilizers at 50 or 100\% of the RDF
   did not maintain the SOC stock. Thus, application of FYM (or other
   organics) in conjunction with mineral fertilizers is essential to
   maintaining and enhancing the SOC stock in the rice-based cropping
   systems.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted during rainy (kharif) seasons of 2006
   and 2007 to study the productivity, biological feasibility, economic
   viability and nutrient dynamics in Bt cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) -
   groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.) intercropping system under various
   fertility levels. Groundnut as an intercrop enhanced the productivity of
   cotton by 0.25 tonne/ha. Cotton receiving no N showed superior
   performance of intercropped groundnut in terms of pods/plant (36.0),
   kernels/ pod (1.56) and pod yield (0.56 tonne/ha). The mean N, P, K
   uptake in intercropped cotton were 79.4, 6.6, and 46.0 kg/ha higher than
   sole cotton (149.9, 16.3 and 80.0 kg/ ha), respectively. Among N
   management practices, substitution of 25\% RDN through farmyard manure
   in cotton gave the highest system productivity (3.5 tonnes seed cotton
   equivalent yield/ha), net returns ((sic)50 780) and production
   efficiency (19.4 kg/ha/day). The highest B: C ratio (2.58) was observed
   with 100\% RDN, followed by 75\% RDN + 25\% through FYM (2.29). Control
   treatment gave the highest LER (1.72), RNR (1.37) and ATER (1.47),
   followed by 50\% RDN + 50\% through FYM. However, soil NPK balance were
   in favour of 50\% RDN substitution through farmyard manure.},

Title = {Modelling soil moisture and assessing its impacts on water sharing and

Abstract = {In the Wadi Laba spate irrigation system, sorghum and maize crops
   complete their growth period (September to April) mainly based on the
   soil moisture stored during the flood season from 15 June to 15 August.
   For the past 100 years, the farmers have strived to divert the
   unpredictable and destructive floods and irrigate their fields three to
   four times (irrigation gift is 50 cm each time) so as to harvest 4.5 t
   ha(-1) yr(-1) of sorghum or sorghum and maize. Simultaneously, to
   realize fair water sharing, the farmers introduced two water rights and
   rules: (1) a field is entitled to a second, third or fourth turn only
   after all other fields have received one, two or three turns
   respectively; (2) upstream fields have a priority right to the medium
   floods (<= 50 m(3) s(-1)), the midstream and downstream fields to the
   moderately large and large (50-200 m(3) s(-1)), and very large (200-265
   m(3) s(-1)) floods respectively. These water rights and rules were
   regularly observed in the indigenous systems when farmers relied on each
   other for the timely maintenance of the earthen/brushwood structures
   that frequently failed, but are being violated following the
   introduction of the concrete structures in 2000.
   The Soil Water Accounting Model (SWAM) that has been developed as part
   of the study on which this paper is based revealed that when a field
   receives two, three or four turns, the soil moisture at the onset of the
   planting season remains the same, namely 67.5, 72 and 77.5 cm if the
   field gets its last turn by 15 July, 30 July and 15 August respectively.
   These results were validated with the more complex Soil Water Atmosphere
   Plant Model (SWAP). Even the 67.5 cm water depth (with some 120 mm
   contribution from rainfall), sufficiently supports the said yield.
   Unlike in the indigenous system, when the fields usually received a
   third turn by the end of the flood season, the concrete structures of
   the modern system have made it possible for the upstream farmers to
   irrigate three or even four times by July. Thus, to maintain fairness of
   water sharing, the water rights on the size of floods would have to be
   modified to: regardless of the flood size, if upstream fields are
   irrigated twice or three times by 15-30 July, the subsequent floods
   would have to be conveyed to the midstream/downstream fields. Copyright

Abstract = {Both sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and soil moisture (SM) can
   influence climate over land. This paper presents a comprehensive
   comparison of SM versus SST impacts on land climate in the warm season.
   The authors perform fully coupled ensemble experiments with the
   Community Earth System Model in which they prescribe SM or SSTs to the
   long-term median seasonal cycles. It is found that SM variability
   overall impacts warm-season land climate to a similar extent as SST
   variability, in the midlatitudes, tropics, and subtropics. Removing SM
   or SST variability impacts land climate means and reduces land climate
   variability at different time scales by 10\%-50\% (temperature) and
   0\%-10\% (precipitation). Both SM- and SST-induced changes are strongest
   for hot temperatures (up to 50\%) and for extreme precipitation (up to
   20\%). These results are qualitatively similar for the present day and
   the end of the twenty-first century. Removed SM variability affects
   surface climate through corresponding variations in surface energy
   fluxes, and this is controlled to first order by the land-atmosphere
   coupling strength and the natural SM variability. SST-related changes
   are partly controlled by the relation of local temperature or
   precipitation with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In addition, in
   specific regions SST-induced SM changes alter the ``direct{''}
   SST-induced climate changes; on the other hand, SM variability is found
   to slightly affect SSTs in some regions. Nevertheless a large level of
   independence is found between SM-climate and SST-climate coupling. This
   highlights the fact that SM conditions can influence land climate
   variables independently of any SST effects and that (initial) soil
   moisture anomalies can provide valuable information in (sub)seasonal
   weather forecasts.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is an important parameter that is widely used for drought
   monitoring and characterizing environment. Based on the universal
   triangular space constructed by the normalized land surface temperature
   (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study
   proposes a simple method to estimate surface soil moisture (SSM) using a
   nonlinear interpolation function with theoretical limiting edges derived
   from the energy balance principle. As an interpolation function, the
   quadratic polynomial equation is used to reveal the relationships among
   soil moisture, LST, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC), which are
   determined and validated by the simulation data from the Noah land
   surface model (Noah LSM). The developed function is much simpler than
   Carlson's function because the number of coefficients is reduced by
   half. The proposed method is applied to the North China Plain. The
   estimation results are also validated by the in situ measurements of
   soil water content at 10 and 20 cm depths at the Yucheng meteorological
   station; the corresponding biases are as high as 0.02 and 0.12
   m(3)/m(3), respectively, and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are
   approximately 0.04 and 0.10 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The results
   indicate that this method has high-estimation accuracy and overcomes the
   weakness induced by the effects of atmospheric conditions on different
   days. This study provides insight into the comparable soil moisture
   estimation from remotely sensed data on a regional scale.},

Abstract = {There is a lack of high-quality global observations to evaluate soil
   drying impacts on surface fluxes in Earth system models (ESMs). Here we
   use a novel diagnostic based on the observed warming of the land
   relative to the atmosphere during dry spells (relative warming rate,
   RWR) to assess ESMs. The ESMs show that RWR is well correlated with
   changes in the partition of surface energy between sensible and latent
   heat across dry spells. Therefore, comparisons between observed and
   simulated RWR reveal where models are unable to capture a realistic soil
   moisture-heat flux relationship. The results show that in general,
   models simulate dry spell ET dynamics well in arid zones while decreases
   in evaporative fraction appear excessive in some models in continental
   climate zones. Our approach can help guide land model development in
   aspects that are key in simulating extreme events like heat waves.
   Plain Language Summary We present a methodology to assess how land
   evapotranspiration (ET) responds to soil moisture (SM) in climate models
   across the world. Our method is based on looking at the observed versus
   modeled evolution of land surface temperature and the overlying air
   temperature during rain free periods, when SM decreases and limits the
   amount of land ET. We observed a good relationship between modeled ET
   and the modeled relative evolution of these temperatures during dry
   periods. Therefore, our method can be used to evaluate how realistic are
   modeled SM-ET relationships when soils are drying. Our results show that
   in general, models capture fairly well the influence of SM on ET in arid
   climate zones, while they perform less well in continental climate
   zones. Our method provides a unique new tool to improve aspects of
   weather and climate models important for simulating phenomena such as
   heat waves.},

Abstract = {In model-based irrigation control, the root zone soil moisture deficit
   (RZSMD) is maintained based on the water balance. To predict RZSMD in
   real-time, effective rainfall, irrigation and crop evapotranspiration
   need to be calculated online. Estimating the first two variables is more
   important yet tedious due to practical limitations of knowing the amount
   of water actually infiltrated into the soil. In order to solve this
   problem, we propose to apply system identification on water balance data
   to obtain a linear time series model. We further investigate how to
   carry out the modelling (i) under saturated conditions, (ii) when there
   is a rule-based irrigation control, and (iii) under measurement noise in
   the soil moisture readings. Using synthetic data we obtained a model fit
   above 80\% in all cases. Additionally, we show the model optimality and
   applicability with an independent dataset, using residual tests. For two
   sets of field data, we observed model fits of 84\% and 63\%, and
   satisfaction in all residual tests. Simplicity in the model reduces
   calibration efforts whereas its linearity and adequacy recommend it for
   real-time irrigation control applications. In summary, the results
   indicate that a first order linear time series model based on system
   identification can successfully predict RZSMD in a real-time irrigation
   control system. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Although recent years have witnessed excellent technological
   improvements, the initial setup costs of solar energy systems remain
   very high. It is for this reason that solar systems have not become
   sufficiently widespread. Optimum selection of panel power increases the
   applicability of these systems while at the same time decreasing their
   cost. The choice of which panel power is to be installed in a solar
   powered irrigation system will vary in direct proportion to the power of
   the pump supplying the water. In this study a reduction in pump power,
   and thus a reduction in the energy demand of the pump, is achieved by
   ensuring that the solar-powered drip irrigation system in an orchard is
   using water efficiently. To determine which areas needed to be
   irrigated, the authors used a soil moisture distribution map obtained
   via the artificial neural networks method. Using the system and software
   they developed to determine the soil moisture distribution, they were
   able to obtain an even distribution of water. Thus by preventing
   unnecessary irrigation, not only was instantaneous water demand reduced,
   but it was also possible to ensure the protection of freshwater
   resources. The system developed by the authors was observed to reduce
   the orchard's daily water and energy consumption by 38\%. Thus, using
   the method applied, it was possible to reduce the amount of pump power,
   depending on the instantaneous water demand, the total power of the
   solar panels, the current values of the electrical motor, the battery
   and power control units, and all other costs. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Variations in soil moisture strongly affect surface energy balances,
   regional runoff, land erosion and vegetation productivity (i.e.,
   potential crop yield). Hence, the estimation of soil moisture is very
   valuable in the social, economic, humanitarian (food security) and
   environmental segments of society. Extensive efforts to exploit the
   potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify this complex
   variable are ongoing. This study aims at developing a new index, the
   Thermal Ground cover Moisture Index (TGMI), for estimating soil moisture
   content. This index is based on empirical parameterization of the
   relationship between raw image digital count (DC) data in the thermal
   infrared spectral band and ground cover (determined from raw image
   digital count data in the red and near-infrared spectral bands). The
   index uses satellite-derived information only, and the potential for its
   operational application is therefore great. This study was conducted in
   18 commercial agricultural fields near Lubbock, TX (USA). Soil moisture
   was measured in these fields over two years and statistically compared
   to corresponding values of TGMI determined from Landsat image data.
   Results indicate statistically significant correlations between TGMI and
   field measurements of soil moisture (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.05, MBE = 0.17
   and AAE = 0.049), suggesting that soil moisture can be estimated using
   this index. It was further demonstrated that maps of TGMI developed from
   Landsat imagery could be constructed to show the relative spatial
   distribution of soil moisture across a region.},

Abstract = {Together with the continuous development of passive microwave surface
   soil moisture (SSM) products from newly launched satellites, it is
   necessary to perform reliable validations to assess their accuracy. With
   this aim, a new ``bottom-up{''} validation approach is proposed based on
   the synergistic use of in situ SSM measurements from the soil moisture
   measurement station network (REMEDHUS) of the University of Salamanca,
   Salamanca, Spain, and optical/thermal infrared observations over 18
   cloud-free days from Landsat-8. An SSM estimation method using the
   boundary information from the land surface temperature and normalized
   difference vegetation index triangle space was developed for regional
   SSM mapping. The retrieved SSM reached a relatively good performance
   (mean R 2 and rootmean-squared error of 0.64 and 0.033 ne/m(3),
   respectively). Then, the regional SSM was aggregated into the grid-cell
   scale of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3
   high-resolution (0.1 degrees /10 km) soil moisture product to validate
   it both at network and grid-cell levels. At the network level, the
   derived regional SSM showed a good agreement with the averaged in situ
   measurements over the network (R = 0.731). However, at the grid-cell
   level, small variations were observed for the cells over the network
   between the estimates and the AMSR2 product, with negative biases
   (-0.044 to -0.090 m(3)/m(3)) and positive correlations (R > 0.25) for
   most cells. In addition, it is shown that the descending product has a
   slightly better performance than does the ascending one. The preliminary
   assessments suggested that the proposed method provides new insights
   into the validation of passive microwave soil moisture products, while
   avoiding the common issue related to the big disparity in spatial scales
   between satellite observation and in situ measurements.},

   moisture profiles. The distribution and architecture of the root systems
   depended strongly on the moisture of the deeper soil layer. For one
   genotype, roots, specifically lateral roots, were stimulated to grow
   into moist soil when the upper zone was well-watered and were inhibited
   by drier deep zones. In contrast, the other genotype showed much less
   plasticity and responsiveness to upper moist soil, but maintained deeper
   penetration of roots into the dry layer. The sum of shoot and root
   responses was greater when treated simultaneously to low light and low
   soil water, compared to each treatment alone, suggesting the value of
   whole plant phenotyping in response to multiple conditions for agronomic
   improvement. The results suggest that canopy management for increased
   irradiation of leaves would encourage root growth into deeper drier
   soil, and that genetic variation within closely related breeding lines
   may exist to favour surface root growth in response to irrigation or
   in-season rainfall.},

Abstract = {To better predict the soil moisture environment of cool-temperate
   forests, we studied the soil moisture for stands grown under elevated
   Co-2 concentration ({[}Co-2]) using Free Air Co-2 Enrichment (FACE)
   systems (50 Pa {[}CO2](e)) with controls at ambient levels (37 Pa
   {[}CO2](a))), over two years. Two distinct soil conditions, brown forest
   soil and volcanic ash soil, were prepared in each FACE. Two-year-old
   seedlings of six species were planted in May 2003. The soil moisture
   increased under {[}CO2](e) in both soil conditions. Since changes of
   soil moisture depend on evapotranspiration from a stand, we examined the
   fluctuation of soil moisture in relation to the transpiration (Tr) from
   leaves and evaporation (Ev) from the soil surface in the FACE. The Tr
   per leaf area decreased under {[}CO2](e) for both soil conditions,
   although the total Tr per seedling increased because the total leaf area
   per seedling increased under {[}CO2](e). Ev decreased under {[}CO2](e),
   because the soil surface temperature fell in both soils as a result of
   the increase of leaf area index (LAI), which blocked incident sunlight
   at the soil surface. These results show that the increase of soil
   moisture under {[}CO2](e) over two years is due probably to the change
   in Ev. Our results also indicate that the predicted rise in atmospheric
   {[}CO2] will lead to modification of the forest ecosystem accompanied by
   changing soil moisture conditions.},

   Carrying out sensitivity studies within a multiscale assimilation system

   hydrologic modeling system is forced with satellite estimated rainfall,
   and the assimilation performance is evaluated against model simulations
   using in-situ measured rainfall. The study shows that the assimilation
   performance is most sensitive to the spatial availability of soil
   moisture observations, then to revisit time and least sensitive to
   retrieval accuracy. The horizontally coupled assimilation system
   performs reasonably well even with large observation errors, and it is
   less sensitive to retrieval accuracy than the uncoupled system, as
   reported by previous studies. This suggests that more information may be
   extracted from satellite soil moisture observations using multiscale
   assimilation systems resulting in a potentially higher value of such

Abstract = {Root proliferation and greater uptake per unit of root in the
   nutrient-rich zones are often considered to be compensatory responses.
   This study aimed to examine the influence of plant phosphorus (P) status
   and P distribution in the root zone on root P acquisition and root and
   shoot growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a split-root soil
   culture. One compartment (A) was supplied with either 4 or 14 mg P (kg
   soil)(-1), whereas the adjoining compartment (B) had 4 mg Pkg(-1) with a
   vertical high-P strip (44 mg kg(-1)) at 90-110 mm from the plant. Three
   weeks after growing in the split-root system, plants with 4 mg P kg-1
   (low-P plants) started to show stimulatory root growth in the high-P
   strip. Two weeks later, root dry weight and length density in the high-P
   strip were significantly greater for the low-P plants than for the
   plants with 14 mg P (kg soil)(-1). However, after 8 weeks of growth in
   the split-root system, the two P treatments of compartment A had similar
   root growth in the high-P strip of compartment B. The study also showed
   that shoot P concentrations in the low-P plants were 0.6-0.8 mg g(-1)
   compared with 1.7-1.9 mg g(-1) in the 14 mg P kg(-1) plants after 3 and
   5 weeks of growth, but were similar (1.1-1.4 mg g(-1)) between the two
   plants by week 8. The low-P plants had lower root P concentration in
   both compartments than those with 14 mg P kg(-1) throughout the three
   harvests. The findings may indicate that root proliferation and P
   acquisition under heterogeneous conditions are influenced by shoot P
   status (internal) and soil P distribution (external). There were no
   differences in the total root and shoot dry weight between the two P
   treatments at weeks 3 and 5 because enhanced root growth and P uptake in
   the high-P strip by the low-P plants were compensated by reduced root
   growth elsewhere. In contrast, total plant growth and total root and
   shoot P contents were greater in the 14 mg P kg(-1) soil than in the
   low-P soil at week 8. The two P treatments did not affect the ratio of
   root to shoot dry weight with time. The results suggest that root
   proliferation and greater P uptake in the P-enriched zone may meet the
   demand for P by P-deficient plants only for a limited period of time.},

Abstract = {Revegetation is an important means to improve the ecosystem services
   delivered by degraded land; however, inappropriate revegetation can
   result in severe soil desiccation and ecosystem degradation in
   water-limited regions. Here we evaluated seven common revegetation
   techniques by considering both deep soil moisture deficit and soil
   organic carbon (SOC) sequestration on the Loess Plateau of China,
   attempting to identify a suitable method for soil restoration of
   severely degraded ecosystems. The seven revegetation techniques
   considered were: two single-species shrub plantations (Caragana
   korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides), two single species tree
   plantations (Platycladus orientalis with terracing and Robinia
   pseudoacacia), and three mixed plantations (P. orientalis/H. rhamnoides
   with terracing, R. pseudoacacia/H. rhamnoides, R. pseudoacacia/P.
   orientalis). A 12-year-old abandoned cropland served as the control. The
   results showed that the single-species plantation of P. orientalis with
   terracing had the lowest soil moisture deficit in deep layers (200-800
   cm) but also had the lowest SOC sequestration. In contrast, the mixed
   plantation of R. pseudoacacia/H. rhamnoides had the highest SOC
   sequestration but also had significant deep soil moisture deficit. In
   contrast, the mixed plantation of P. orientalis/H. rhamnoides with
   terracing showed near-zero deep soil moisture deficit and significant,
   positive SOC sequestration. Therefore, this mixed plantation was
   identified as representing a suitable revegetation technique for this
   region. The results here suggest that appropriate mixed tree/shrub
   plantations with appropriate land engineering measures could deliver
   effective soil restoration in such environments. Our results provide an
   insight into revegetation in areas with degraded land.},

Abstract = {Low pH is one of the most yield-limiting factors for crop production in
   Cerrado soils. The objective of this study was to determine influence of
   soil pH on grain yield and its components, and use of nutrients by dry
   bean in a no-tillage system in an Oxisol (Typic Haplorthox) of the
   Cerrado region of Brazil. Five field experiments were conducted for
   three consecutive years. The pH levels were low (5.3), medium (6.4), and
   high (6.8), created by applying lime at the rates of 0, 12, and 24 Mg
   ha(-1). Grain yield and its components were significantly influenced by
   soil pH. Adequate pH for grain yield and its components was 6.4. Maximum
   variation in grain yield was measured by shoot dry weight, and minimum
   variation was due to 100-grain weight. Nutrient utilization efficiency
   was in the order of magnesium (Mg) > phosphorus (P) > calcium (Ca) >
   potassium (K) > nitrogen (N) > copper (Cu) > manganese (Mn) > zinc (Zn)
   > iron (Fe). Soil extractable P increased linearly with increasing pH in
   the range of 5.3 to 7.3. These results show that adequate soil pH is an
   important soil acidity index in improving bean yield in Brazilian

Abstract = {Crops grown grown in semiarid tainted conditions are prone to water
   stress which could be alleviated by improving cultural practices. This
   study determined the effect of cropping system, cultivar, soil nitrogen
   status and Rhizobium inoculation (Rz) on water use and water use
   efficiency (WUE) of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) in semiarid
   environments. The cultivars Amit, CDC Anna, CDC Frontier, and CDC Xena
   were grown in no-till barley, no-till wheat, and tilled-fallow systems
   and under various rates of N fertilizer (0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 kg N
   ha(-1)) coupled with or without Rz. The study was conducted at Swift
   Current and Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, from 2004 to 2006. On average,
   chickpea used about 10 mm of water from the top 0-15 cm soil depth. In
   the tilled-fallow system, chickpea extracted 20\% more water in the
   15-30 cm depth, 70\% more in the 30-60 cm depth, and 156\% more in the
   60-120 cm depth than when it was grown in the no-till systems. CDC Xena
   had WUE of 5.3 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) or 20\% less than the average WUE (6.6
   kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) of the three other cultivars, even though these
   cultivars used the same amounts of water. Water use efficiency increased
   from 4.7 to 6.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) as N fertilizer rate was increased from
   0 to 112 kg N ha(-1) when chickpea was grown in the no-till barley or
   wheat systems, but chickpea grown in the tilled-fallow system did not
   respond to changes in the fertilizer N rates averaging WUE of 6.5 kg
   ha(-1) mm(-1). In the absence of N fertilizer, the application of Rz
   increased WUE by 33\% for chickpea grown in the no-till barley system,
   30\% in the no-till wheat system, and 9\% in the tilled-fallow system.
   Chickpea inoculated with Rhizobium achieved a WUE value similar to the
   crop fertilized at 84 kg N ha(-1). Without the use of Rz, chickpea
   increased WUE in a linear fashion with increasing fertilizer N rates
   from 0 to 84 kg N ha(-1). Cropping system, cultivar, and inoculation all
   had greater impact on WUE than on the amount of water extracted by the
   crop from the soil. The improvement of cultural practices to promote
   general plant health along with the development of cultivars with
   improved crop yields will be keys for improving water use efficiency of
   chickpea in semiarid environments. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by

Abstract = {Field-cured onions cv. Hyskin (Allium cepa L.) supplied with organic
   nitrogen fertilizer were studied. The fertilizer was applied by
   broadcasting and harrowing, broadcasting and rotary cultivation, or
   placement between rows. Nitrogen dynamics were monitored throughout the
   growing season by soil sampling. Variation in quercetin content in the
   onion scales was analyzed by HPLC. The organically fertilized onions
   were compared with inorganically fertilized onions grown in the same
   field. Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the row at
   sowing or during commercial transplant production was tested but did not
   significantly affect mycorrhizal root colonization levels in the field.
   Onions that received no fertilizer at all or that had fertilizer placed
   between rows had better establishment, probably due to more favorable
   soil nitrogen concentrations for seedling emergence. Broadcast
   application led to higher nitrogen concentration in the root zone,
   resulting in fewer but larger individual onions. Quercetin levels were
   not significantly altered as a result of nitrogen fertilizer source
   (inorganic or organic), application method, or mycorrhizal inoculation.
   However, variation between years was significant, with quercetin levels
   in 2004 almost twice as high as those in 2005.},

Abstract = {Manure generated by dairy cattle is a useful soil amendment but
   contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water pollution from
   nutrient leaching. In order to assess the impact of pine chip biochar
   produced at a peak temperature of 550 degrees C when added to a dairy
   grassland system, a one-year field study was conducted on a sandy loam
   soil under annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) grown for silage in
   Petaluma, California. Manure was applied to all plots at a rate of ca.
   150 m(3) ha(-1) (410 kg N ha(-1)). Control plots received no biochar,
   high application biochar plots (FIB) received biochar (with a 17\% ash
   content) at a rate of 18.8 t ha(-1), and low application biochar plots
   (LB) received the same biochar at 5.7 t ha(-1). Although the HB plots
   demonstrated the lowest cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4)
   emissions, there was no significant difference between treatments (p =
   0.152 and p = 0.496, respectively). Soil pH results from samples
   collected throughout the year indicated a significant treatment effect
   (p = 0.046), though Tukey test results indicated that there was no
   difference between mean values. Soil total carbon was significantly
   higher in HB plots at the end of the experiment (p = 0.025) and nitrate
   (NO3-) intensity throughout the year (which expresses potential exposure
   of NO3- to the soil microbial community) was significantly lower in HB
   plots compared to the control (p = 0.001). Annual cumulative potassium
   (K+) loss from FIB plots was significantly higher than from the other
   treatments (p = 0.018). HB plots also demonstrated a short-term increase
   in phosphorus (P) and ammonium (NH4+) in leachate during the first
   rainfall event following manure and biochar application (p < 0.0001 and
   p = 0.0002, respectively) as well as a short-term decrease of NO3- in
   leachate during a heavy rainfall event following a long dry spell (p =
   0.036), though differences between treatments for cumulative nutrient
   losses were not significant (p = 0.210, p = 0.061, and p = 0.295,
   respectively for P, NH4+, and NO3-). These data indicate that biochar
   produced from pine wood chips at 550 degrees C having high ash content
   (17\%) is not likely to impact GHG emissions in systems with high manure
   application rates. Further research should be conducted in order to
   investigate the impact of biochar amendment on the dynamics and mobility
   of nutrients applied in subsequent repeated applications of dairy
   manure. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {A 3-year field trial of sugarcane, comprising 11 treatment combinations
   of different organic manures with and without Gluconacetobacter
   diazotrophicus (Gd), NPK and an absolute control, on an inceptisol was
   conducted to assess the effect of these treatments on sugarcane total
   and economic yield, the benefit:cost ratio, nutrient balance and soil
   quality in a sugarcane plant-ratoon system. The highest cane yield (78.6
   t ha(-1)) was recorded in the plant crop given vermicompost + Gd,
   whereas ratoon yields (first and second) were highest (80.8 and 74.9
   t/ha(-1), respectively) with sulphitation press mud cake (SPMC) + Gd. In
   both plant and ratoon crops, a number of different organic manures
   produced the highest cane yield that was also statistically similar to
   those obtained with using the recommended NPK levels (76.1, 78.2 and
   71.7 t/ha for plant crop and subsequent two ratoons, respectively). The
   highest benefit:cost (B:C) ratio in the plant and two ratoon crops
   (1.28, 2.36, 2.03 respectively) were obtained with the addition of SPMC
   + Gd. The nutrient balance for NPK in the soil was highest in the SPMC +
   Gd treatment. The highest increase in organic C (94\%) and total N
   (87\%), in comparison to the initial level, and soil microbial biomass C
   (113\%) and soil microbial biomass N (229\%), in comparison to the
   control treatment, was recorded with the addition of SPMC + Gd. The
   maximum decrease in soil bulk density (BD) (12\%) with an increase in
   soil aggregate (17\%) and water infiltration rate (35\%) was obtained
   with the addition of SPMC. Overall, the sugarcane crop responded well to
   different organic manures in a multiple ratooning system with a better
   economic output and improved soil quality. Strategic planning in terms
   of an integrated application of these manures with inorganic chemicals
   will not only sustain our soils but will also be beneficial for our
   farmers in terms of reducing their dependence and expenditure on
   chemical fertilizers.},

   by estimating soil wetness index from surface soil moisture at 10 and 40
   cm depths using a recursive exponential filter. The soil wetness index
   based algorithm is implementable even in the absence of ground
   information for a basin level study. The reference soil moisture dataset
   is obtained from the Global Land Database Assimilation System - NOAH at
   10 and 40 cm depth. The research has also demonstrated significant
   potential of GLDAS-NOAH soil moisture data in the absence of ground
   (in-situ) soil moisture data.
   Of the various factors affecting surface and root zone soil moisture,
   this work evaluates the control of soil constituents on root zone soil
   moisture. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is estimated for
   characteristic time delay with sand, silt and clay percentage at
   different locations. Coupling between and trends of surface and root
   zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crop locations are studied. The
   accuracy of estimated soil wetness index at 10 and 40 cm from two
   different satellite sensors at two different acquisition times
   (ascending and descending passes) is investigated by calculating the
   coefficient of determination, mean absolute error and mean biased error.
   This work highlights the significant difference in surface soil moisture
   estimation by two satellite sensors to derive root zone soil moisture
   for rice and wheat crops. Coefficient of determination is more (similar
   to 0.9) for SMAP derived soil wetness index whereas it is lower (similar
   to 0.65) for AMSR-2 derived soil wetness index for both crops.
   Characteristic time delay variation is observed at two different times
   and at both the depths, with characteristic time delay increasing with
   depth. Also, at the descending pass characteristic time delay is lower
   as compared to the ascending pass. A strong relationship between root
   zone soil moisture and soil texture is observed. For rice crop, a
   positive correlation with sand and clay is observed for Uttar Pradesh,
   Madhya Pradesh and Bihar locations having loam and sandy loam as the
   major soil class. And, for wheat locations, a positive correlation is
   observed for silt and clay for Uttar Pradesh locations and sand for
   Madhya Pradesh locations having loam and clay (light) soil texture. This
   work delivers essential information in understanding sustainable
   irrigation scheduling and increasing irrigation potential for rice and
   wheat crop locations. Having the knowledge of all the factors
   influencing crop cultivation and the derived root zone soil moisture,
   crop production can be optimized.},

Abstract = {Traditional agricultural practices based on non-customized irrigation

   correlation between remote sensing data and field observations, aiming
   to identify the key features and to establish an interpretation pattern
   for the inhomogeneity highlighted by the remote sensing data. Instead of
   using classical methods for the evaluation of land features (field
   analysis, measurements and mapping), the approach is to use high
   resolution multispectral and hyperspectral methods, in correlation with
   data processing and geographic information systems (GIS), in order to

Abstract = {Along with most widely practiced resources conserving technology
   zero-tillage wheat after rice, adoption of permanent beds for rice-wheat

   was carried out in a Typic Haplustept soil of New Delhi, India to study
   the effect of permanent beds on soil hydro-physical properties, root
   growth, nitrogen uptake, and system productivity of irrigated rice-wheat
   rotation. Results revealed that direct-seeded rice followed by wheat on
   permanent beds irrigated at different soil water tensions (field
   capacity, 20 and 40 kPa) reflected a significant variation in soil
   hydro-physical properties, reduced total nitrogen uptake, contribution
   by different plant parts, and N use efficiency compared to wheat after
   flooded transplanted rice system. Rice root weight density at flowering
   was also significantly low at 0-15 cm depth but higher at 15-60 cm depth
   in dry-seeded rice on beds. System productivity of rice-wheat rotation
   was 25-33\% lower in permanent beds compared to flooded transplanted

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted in the southern gully region of the
   Loess Plateau to study the effects of mulching measures on spring maize
   yield and nitrate accumulation in dryland areas under traditional
   tillage conditions. The study was performed to provide a scientific
   basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this
   area. The four treatments were non-mulching (CK), plastic film-mulching
   during the growth period (PM1), plastic film-mulching during the fallow
   period (PM2), and straw-mulching (JM). After 13 years of continuous
   application, the yield of spring maize, the nitrogen uptake by plants,
   and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured. The
   results revealed that soil moisture content and water storage capacity
   of the three soil-mulching treatments were all higher than those of the
   non-mulching treatment. Soil water storage at a depth of 0-300 cm in the
   JM, PM1 and PM2 treatments was increased by 11.8\%, 10.6\% and 8.8\%,
   respectively, compared with the CK treatment. Compared with the CK
   treatment, the mulching treatments significantly increased the
   aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize. The yield
   enhancement effect of the PM1 treatment was the most significant, with a
   yield of 1.1 Mg ha(-1) and an increase of 26.72\%. In addition to the JM
   treatment, the accumulation of soil nitrate at a depth of 0-300 cm in
   the PM1 and PM2 treatments was less than that of the CK treatment, but
   the largest increase in soil nitrate (80.20\% in the JM treatment) was
   observed at a depth of 0-100 cm. The results suggest that in the rainfed
   agriculture in the southern Loess Plateau, mulching cultivation can
   effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage
   capacity. PM1, and PM2 treatments could significantly reduce the content
   and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the deeper soil profile, and the
   three mulching measures could slow down the deep accumulation of soil
   nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent.},

Abstract = {The effects of 20 years of potassium (K) fertilization (in two
   treatments: 113 and 225 kg K2O ha(-1)) on grain and stover yields, plant
   K concentrations, aboveground K uptake, K use efficiencies, soil K
   pools, and the K balance were examined in a Haplic Phaeozem soil under a
   rain-fed mono-cropped spring maize (Zea mays L.) system in the province
   of Jilin, northeast China. The indigenous K supply (zero K application)
   maintained an average grain yield of 7.0 t ha(-1) per year, but the
   year-to-year variation was large. Application of K significantly (P <
   0.05) increased the average grain yields by 15.1 and 13.8\% in the 113
   and 225 kg K2O ha(-1) treatments, respectively, over the experimental
   period. The mean K recovery efficiency, K agronomic efficiency, and K
   partial factor productivity decreased from 37.3 to 28.5\%, 10.8 to 4.9
   kg kg(-1), and 86.8 to 43.1 kg kg(-1) when the K application rate
   increased from 113 to 225 kg 1(20 ha(-1). The effect of K application
   was larger on stover K concentrations than grain K concentrations. In
   the top 100 cm of the soil profile, excessive or non-synchronized K
   application significantly (P < 0.05) increased the leaching of
   exchangeable K in comparison with the control, but K application had
   little effect on soil non-exchangeable K and total K. K fertilizer,
   therefore, plays an important role in increasing grain yields in China,
   but the K application rate can be reduced if farmers return stover to
   the soil and make full use of K below the soil surface. (C) 2014

   Research Institute, Uda Walawe, Sri Lanka (6 degrees 21'N, 80 degrees

   different depths of the 1 m soil profile were measured. The variety SL
   88 116 showed the highest RLD values of 1.49 in top (0-30 cm), 0.33 in
   middle (30-60 cm) and 0.65 cm cm(-3) in entire (0-100 cm) layers of soil

   bottom (60-100 cm) layer of soil profile under rain-fed conditions. RLD
   of all varieties except SL 88 116 under irrigation were significantly (P
   < 0.05) greater (15-63\%) than under rain-fed conditions. The rain-fed
   cane yield showed a significant (P < 0.05) positive correlation with RLD
   in the middle soil layer. Varieties with higher root length densities in
   the 30-60 cm soil layer survive better during significant water deficit
   periods in the top soil layer (0-30 cm), and such varieties produce high

Abstract = {Winter wheat-maize rotations are dominant cropping systems on the North
   China Plain, where recently the use of organic manure with grain crops
   has almost disappeared. This could reduce soil fertility and crop
   productivity in the long run. A 20-year field experiment was conducted
   to 1) assess the effect of inorganic and organic nutrient sources on
   yield and yield trends of both winter wheat and maize, 2) monitor the
   changes in soil organic matter content under continuous wheat-maize
   cropping with different soil fertility management schemes, and 3)
   identify reasons for yield trends observed in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu
   Province, over a 20-year period. There were eight treatments applied to
   both wheat and maize seasons: a control treatment (C); three inorganic
   fertilizers, that is, nitrogen (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), and
   nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK); and addition of farmyard
   manure (FYM) to these four treatments, that is, M, MN, MNP, and MNPK. At
   the end of the experiment the MN, MNP, and MNPK treatments had the
   highest yields, about 7 t wheat ha(-1) and 7.5 t maize ha(-1), with each
   about 1 t ha(-1) more than the NPK treatments. Over 20 years with FYM
   soil organic matter increased by 80\% compared to only 10\% with NPK,
   which explained yield increases. However, from an environmental and
   agronomic perspective, manure application was not a superior strategy to
   NPK fertilizers. AA If manure was to be applied, though, it would be
   best applied to the wheat crop, which showed a better response than
   maize.},

Abstract = {In this paper the suitability of the HYDRUS-2D model to simulate
   volumetric soil water content in the root zone of a potato crop under
   subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) is initially assessed on the basis of a
   field study. Then, considering that the crop is moderately sensitive to
   soil salinity, the model is tested to predict the salt distribution
   around a buried emitter, when two different water qualities
   (i.e.electrical conductivity of 1.0 and 4.0 dS m(-1)) are used during
   the growing season (treatments T1 and T2). Finally, the soil volume in
   which salt accumulates is distinguished by the model for the two
   treatments, for which the respective yields are not significantly
   different. The results showed that in the root zone, simulated and
   measured soil water content (SWC) are fairly close. HYDRUS-2D well
   enough predicts the average salt concentration in the soil and evaluates
   the dynamic of mass-conservative solutes around buried emitters. In both
   treatments, the salt concentration resulted in an increase in the
   wetting bulb, with a maximum located towards the edge of the wetting
   bulb and near the soil surface. Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons,

Title = {Soil moisture in relation to lake fluctuations in a river-lake-basin
   system: A case study of the Poyang Lake region, China},
Journal = {ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {104},
Pages = {306-312},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Lake fluctuations in river-lake-basin (RLB) systems are highly complex
   because of the significant interactions of various hydrological
   variables. Clarifying these interactions would be helpful for
   understanding the physical mechanisms of lake fluctuations and improving
   responses to extreme hydrological events (i.e., drought or flood).
   Though numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the flow
   between rivers and lakes (river-lake interaction), research on the
   hydrological processes between a lake and its surrounding basin
   (lake-basin interaction) remains rare. This study investigates
   lake-basin interactions by examining the changes in the water
   distribution between the land and a lake with an examination of the
   Poyang Lake region, China. Specifically, this study first estimates
   water storage by employing the water balance model. Then, the spatial
   and temporal correlations between the lake area and soil moisture are
   examined to capture the lake-land interaction. The results show that the
   region's annual water storage has decreased in recent decades and varies
   in different months. Specifically, more water in the region is stored in
   the lake before July, and increasing amounts of water are held on land
   after that. Spatially, soil moisture is low in the region near the lake
   in summer because of the high radiation of water reflectance, which
   enhances evapotranspiration. By contrast, soil moisture is high in other
   seasons because of the flow from top to bottom. It can be concluded that
   soil moisture could mitigate the change in water storage due to the
   shrinkage of Poyang Lake, which is characterized by significant spatial
   and temporal variabilities. The results of this study help elucidate the
   dynamics and distribution of water resources in similar RLB systems,
   support water management and promote local sustainable development.},

Abstract = {The effects of insect defoliators on throughfall and soil nutrient
   fluxes were studied in coniferous and deciduous stands at five UK
   intensive monitoring plots (1998 to 2008) Links were found between the
   dissolved organic carbon (DOC) nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) fluxes

   consecutive years in shallow soil waters Synchronous rises in deep soil
   NO3-N fluxes at the Grizedale sandy site indicate downward flushing not
   seen at the clay site Under three Sitka spruce stands generation of
   honeydew (DOC) was attributed to two aphid species (Elatobium abietinum
   and Clara pilicornis) with distinctive feeding strategies Throughfall
   DOC showed mean annual fluxes (6 seasons) similar to 45-60 kg ha(-1)
   compared with rainfall values of 14-22 kg ha(-1) Increases of total N in
   throughfall and NO3-N fluxes in shallow soil solution were detected soil
   water fluxes reached 8 kg ha(-1) in Llyn Brianne similar to 25 kg ha(-1)
   in Tummel and similar to 40 kg NO3-N ha(-1) in Coalburn At Tummel on
   sandy soil NO3-N leaching showed increased concentration at depth
   attributed to microbiological activity within the soil By contrast at
   Coalburn and Llyn Brianne sites on peaty gleys soil water NO3-N was
   retained mostly within the humus layer Soil type is thus key to

Title = {Evaluating the Influence of Antecedent Soil Moisture on Variability of
   the North American Monsoon Precipitation in the Coupled MM5/VIC Modeling
   System},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MODELING EARTH SYSTEMS},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {1},
Abstract = {The influence of antecedent soil moisture on North American monsoon
   system (NAMS) precipitation variability was explored using the MM5
   mesoscale model coupled with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)
   land surface model. Sensitivity experiments were performed with extreme
   wet and dry initial soil moisture conditions for both the 1984 wet
   monsoon year and the 1989 dry year. The MM5-VIC model reproduced the key
   features of NAMS in 1984 and 1989 especially over northwestern Mexico.
   Our modeling results indicate that the land surface has memory of the
   initial soil wetness prescribed at the onset of the monsoon that
   persists over most of the region well into the monsoon season ( e. g.
   until August). However, in contrast to the classical thermal contrast
   concept, where wetter soils lead to cooler surface temperatures, less
   land-sea thermal contrast, weaker monsoon circulations and less
   precipitation, the coupled model consistently demonstrated a positive
   soil moisture - precipitation feedback. Specifically, anomalously wet
   pre-monsoon soil moisture always lead to enhanced monsoon precipitation,
   and the reverse was also true. Both the large-scale circulation change
   and local land-atmospheric interactions in response to pre-monsoon soil
   moisture anomalies play important roles in the coupled model's positive
   soil moisture - monsoon precipitation feedback. However, the former may
   be sensitive to the strength and location of the thermal anomalies, thus
   leaving open the possibility of both positive and negative soil moisture
   - precipitation feedbacks. Furthermore, our use of a regional model with
   prescribed large-scale circulation at the model boundaries leaves open
   the possibility that the model behavior may, to some extent, reflect its
   limited ability to adjust its large-scale circulation to the regional
   thermal changes.},

Abstract = {The present study was undertaken to quantify changes in the status of
   soil nutrients, their depletion and build-up after continuous long
   intensive cropping for last 36 years in a permanent manorial trial which
   has been in progress since 1972 in an alfisol of western Himalayas. The
   rotation was maize-wheat which included various combinations of N, P, K,
   Zn and FYM (farmyard manure). Continuous cultivation influenced pH, OC
   (organic carbon), available N (nitrogen), P (phosphorus) and K
   (potassium). An increase in the status of organic carbon was observed in
   100\% NPK + FYM treatments for more than three decades from initial
   value of 7.9 to 12.0 g/kg. The use of either FYM or lime alongwith 100\%
   NPK sustained crop productivity or improved nutrient status. However,
   imbalanced use of nutrients i.e. NP or N alone is adversely affecting
   the fertility of soil by aggravating the problem of soil acidity.
   Application of S free P fertilizer DAP (diammonium phosphate)
   drastically reduced the yield of both the crops. Thus, continuous use of
   balanced fertilizers is necessary for sustaining soil fertility and
   productivity of crops.},

Abstract = {Our study quantified variations leaf respiration in darkness (R (D)) and
   light (R (L)), and associated traits along the Franz Josef Glacier soil
   development chronosequence in New Zealand.
   At six sites along the chronosequence (soil age: 6, 60, 150, 500, 12,000
   and 120,000 years old), we measured rates of leaf R (D), R (L) (using
   Kok method), light-saturated CO2 assimilation rates (A), leaf mass per
   unit area (M (A)), and concentrations of leaf nitrogen ({[}N]),
   phosphorus ({[}P]), soluble sugars and starch.
   The chronosequence was characterised by decreasing R (D), R (L) and A,
   reduced {[}N] and {[}P] and increasing M (A) as soil age increased.
   Light inhibition of R occurred across the chronosequence (mean
   inhibition = 16 \%), resulting in ratios of R (L):A being lower than for
   R (D):A. Importantly, the degree of light inhibition differed across the
   chronosequence, being lowest at young sites and highest at old sites.
   This resulted in R (L):A ratios being relatively constant across the
   chronosequence, whereas R (D):A ratios increased with increasing soil
   age. Log-log R-A-M (A)-{[}N] relationships remained constant along the
   chronosequence. By contrast, relationships linking rates of leaf R to
   {[}P] differed among leaves with low vs high {[}N]:{[}P] ratios. Slopes
   of log-log bivariate relationships linking R (L) to A, M (A), {[}N] and
   {[}P] were steeper than that for R (D).
   Our findings have important implications for predictive models that seek
   to account for light inhibition of R, and for our understanding of how
   environmental gradients impact on leaf trait relationships.},

Title = {Importance of cover crops in alleviating negative effects of reduced
   soil tillage and promoting soil fertility in a winter wheat cropping
   system},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Reduction of soil tillage is of paramount importance for agricultural
   soil preservation. However, it is often accompanied by yield reduction
   and weed management problems. In this perspective, cover crops could
   play an important role to alleviate weed infestation and sustain yield.
   In this study, the results from a three-year experiment of cover crop
   cultivation in different soil tillage treatments is presented, together
   with results from DayCent simulations on the long term evolution of soil
   organic carbon and total nitrogen. Eight cover crop treatments were set
   up as subtreatments in a long term experiment in Switzerland. Cover
   crops were cultivated for a short two-month period between two winter
   wheats. Substantial differences in cover crop growth were observed
   depending on cover crop species. In all tillage treatments, high cover
   crop biomass production allowed to supress weed biomass compared to the
   no cover crop control. Wheat grain yield was higher in the minimum
   tillage than in the plough treatment. In the no till treatment, wheat
   yield was notably low, except in the field pea treatments, where wheat
   yield reached values similar to that observed in the plough and minimum
   tillage treatments. In addition, these differences in biomass production
   translated into important differences in nutrient inputs, and even in
   soil nutrient concentration in some cases. Long term simulations showed
   that cover crop cultivation could increase drastically soil organic
   carbon and total nitrogen, especially in reduced tillage treatments.
   Altogether, these results demonstrated that the Presence of a
   well-developed cover crop, even for only two months, allows to sustain
   wheat yield in a no till treatment. It impacts also soil fertility and
   nutrient cycling. This study shows that an accurate use and management
   of cover crops, in interaction with tillage reduction, could maintain
   yield and improve soil fertility in the long term.},

Title = {Roller Type and Operating Speed Effects on Rye Termination Rates, Soil
   Moisture, and Yield of Sweet Corn in a No-till System},
Journal = {HORTSCIENCE},
Year = {2012},
Volume = {47},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted in Cullman, AL, to evaluate the effects
   of three different rollers/crimpers on the termination of a rye (Secale
   cereale L) winter cover crop, soil moisture, and yield of sweet corn
   (Zen mays saccharata L.) in a no-till system. The following roller types
   were tested: a straight bar roller, a smooth roller with crimper, and a
   two-stage roller. These rollers were tested at operating speeds of 3.2
   km h(-1) and 6.4 km.h(-1). The three rollers/crimpers were compared with
   a smooth drum roller (no crimping bars) plus glyphosate applied at rate
   1.0 kg.ha(-1) used as a control. Rye termination dates were selected to
   be 3 weeks before the recommended sweet corn planting date, which is in
   the beginning of May for this region. Data indicate that at 3 weeks
   after rolling for all seasons (2006-2008), 100\% rye termination was
   reached with the smooth drum roller and glyphosate. Two weeks after
   rolling, average rye termination rates by rollers/crimpers alone were
   54.6\%, 30.0\%, and 50.4\% in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Three
   weeks after rolling, rye termination rates increased only by approximate
   to 10\% compared with 2 weeks after rolling. These termination levels
   were below the recommended rate of 90\% termination necessary for
   planting a cash crop into the cover residue. Lower rye termination was
   probably caused by rolling the rye in an early growth stage (flowering
   stage). The rollers' operating speed did not influence rye termination
   rates. Similarly, roller type did not affect soil moisture during the
   first and second week after rolling. Applying glyphosate with rolling
   did not increase yield of sweet corn in any of the three growing
   seasons, and in 2006, sweet corn yield was lower compared with the
   roller alone treatments. These results are important to vegetable
   organic systems, in which use of herbicides is not allowed. No
   significant difference in sweet corn yield was found between operating
   speeds of 3.2 km.h(-1) vs. 6.4 km.h(-1) and between the assigned
   treatments in all growing seasons. However, significant differences in
   sweet corn yield were detected between the years, most likely as a
   result of different weather patterns. The lowest sweet corn yield of
   3513 kg.ha(-1) was reported in 2007 as a result of severe drought in
   spring and summer of 2007. The highest yield of 15,613 kg-ha(-1) was
   recorded in 2006. In 2008, the yield was 10,158 kg-ha(-1). Although the
   different roller designs were not as effective in ending the rye cover
   crop compared with the glyphosate treatment, sweet corn yields were
   unaffected. Multiple rolling operations over the same area could be
   useful if greater rye termination levels are required without the use of
   a herbicide, but this recommendation should be tested experimentally in
   more detail.},

   terrestrial system model},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN WATER RESOURCES},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {224-238},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {The linkage between root zone soil moisture and groundwater is either
   neglected or simplified in most land surface models. The fully-coupled
   subsurface-land surface model TerrSysMP including variably saturated
   groundwater dynamics is used in this work. We test and compare five data
   assimilation methodologies for assimilating groundwater level data via
   the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to improve root zone soil moisture
   estimation with TerrSysMP. Groundwater level data are assimilated in the
   form of pressure head or soil moisture (set equal to porosity in the
   saturated zone) to update state vectors. In the five assimilation
   methodologies, the state vector contains either (i) pressure head, or
   (ii) log-transformed pressure head, or (iii) soil moisture, or (iv)
   pressure head for the saturated zone only, or (v) a combination of
   pressure head and soil moisture, pressure head for the saturated zone
   and soil moisture for the unsaturated zone. These methodologies are
   evaluated in synthetic experiments which are performed for different
   climate conditions, soil types and plant functional types to simulate
   various root zone soil moisture distributions and groundwater levels.
   The results demonstrate that EnKF cannot properly handle strongly skewed
   pressure distributions which are caused by extreme negative pressure
   heads in the unsaturated zone during dry periods. This problem can only
   be alleviated by methodology (iii), (iv) and (v). The last approach
   gives the best results and avoids unphysical updates related to strongly
   skewed pressure heads in the unsaturated zone. If groundwater level data
   are assimilated by methodology (iii), EnKF fails to update the state
   vector containing the soil moisture values if for (almost) all the
   realizations the observation does not bring significant new information.
   Synthetic experiments for the joint assimilation of groundwater levels
   and surface soil moisture support methodology (v) and show great
   potential for improving the representation of root zone soil moisture.},

Abstract = {A long-term field experiment with rice-wheat cropping was started in the
   wet season of 1988 with four levels of lantana (Lantana camara L.) (0,
   10, 20, and 30 Mg ha(-1) on fresh weight basis) and three tillage
   practices (No puddling, puddling, and soil compaction). From wet season
   of 1997, however, three tillage practices were replaced with three
   levels of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) to rice (33, 66, and 100\% of
   recommended) and 66\% of recommended N, phosphorus (P), and K to wheat.
   Phosphorus was totally omitted for the rice crop. The recommended N and
   K for rice was 90 and 40kg ha(-1), whereas the recommendations for N, P,
   and K for wheat were 120, 90 and 30kg ha(-1). Organic amendments are
   known to improve soil productivity under rice-wheat cropping by
   improving physical conditions and nutrient status of the soil, but their
   availability is restricted. There is a need to identify locally
   available and cost-effective organic materials that have minimal
   alternate uses as fodder and fuel. We evaluated Lantana camara L.
   residues, a fast-growing weed in nearby wastelands, as a potential soil
   organic amendment. Among the different fractions of K, nonexchangeable K
   was dominant followed by exchangeable and water soluble K. The
   incorporation of lantana (10 to 30 Mg ha(-1)) over the last 12years has
   resulted in a significant build-up of all the K fractions, the maximum
   being in water-soluble K (10 to 32\%) followed by exchangeable K (18 to
   27\%) and least in nonexchangeable K (5 to 7\%) over no lantana
   incorporation. The increasing levels of these two inputs significantly
   and consistently increased ammonium acetate (NH4OAc)- extracted K
   (available K) content in soil and also resulted in significantly higher
   accumulation of K by the crops during the years of experimentation.
   Among different K fractions, exchangeable K was observed to be the most
   important K fraction contributing towards wheat and rice yields as well
   as K accumulation by wheat and rice. Stepwise multiple regression
   equations indicated that exchangeable K was the most important variable
   contributing towards total variation in grain yield and K accumulation
   by wheat or rice.},

Abstract = {Transgenic glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is
   cultivated throughout the United States. Soybean growth is influenced by
   the presence of weeds, although managing non-crop vegetation can
   potentially impact soil arthropods, which are being increasingly
   recognized for their impacts on soil health, plant growth, and
   above-ground trophic interactions. We investigated how weed management
   (weedy controls, hand-weeded, glyphosate herbicide) and soil insecticide
   (chlorpyrifos) application affected densities of soil arthropods, soil
   nutrient availability, soybean growth and yield, and densities of an
   above-ground herbivore on sandy and clayey soils for two consecutive
   growing seasons. The soil insecticide treatment was intended to lower
   densities of subterranean arthropods to gain insight into how their
   presence influenced other factors, although their densities were
   primarily reduced the first year of the study. Surprisingly, weed
   management and soil insecticide use had virtually no interactive effects
   on any response. Weed presence had a positive effect on soil K at the
   sandy site and on nodule density per unit root. Negative effects of weed
   management on plant growth and aphids were related to the presence of
   weeds rather than herbicide use. Reduced soybean aphid density (at the
   clayey site) and soil P availability (at the sandy site) were associated
   with insecticide treated plots. Conversely, several measures of plant
   productivity, including number of nodules per unit root, and root and
   shoot biomass increased in + insecticide plots compared to other
   treatments, although effect strength depended on year and location.
   Collembola were the dominant soil microarthropod, and their densities in
   2012 were negatively associated with nodule numbers in 2013. One
   explanatory hypothesis is that increased plant growth in plots treated
   with insecticide was caused by altered soil arthropod-microorganism
   interactions, possibly affecting arbuscular mycorrhizae function. This
   work highlights the importance of management decisions that affect soil
   arthropods in annual legume production systems.},

Abstract = {Understanding the relationships between root zone soil moisture and

   resources and monitor drought-related stress in vegetation. In this
   article, the relationships between vegetation indices (VIs) and in situ
   soil moisture under maize and soybean canopies were analysed using

   maize-based VIs exhibited significant correlations with soil moisture at
   a depth of 100 cm (P < 0.01) and kept soil moisture memory for a long
   period of time (45 days). Among the VIs applied to maize, the
   chrolophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) correlated best with the
   concurrent soil moisture at 100 cm depth (P < 0.01) for up to 20 day lag
   periods. The same index showed a significant correlation with soil
   moisture at a 50 cm depth for lag periods from 10 (P < 0.05) to 60 days
   (P < 0.01). VIs applied to soybean resulted in statistically significant
   correlations with soil moisture at the shallower 10 and 25 cm depths,
   and the correlation coefficients declined with increasing depths. As
   opposed to maize, soybean held a shorter soil moisture memory as the
   correlations for all VIs versus soil moisture at 10 cm depth were
   strongest for the 5 day lag period. Wide dynamic range VI and normalized
   difference VI performed better in characterizing soil moisture at the 10
   and 25 cm depths under soybean canopies when compared with enhanced VI
   and CIred-edge.},

Abstract = {Low-frequency microwave brightness temperature is strongly affected by
   near-surface soil moisture; therefore, it can be assimilated into a land
   surface model to improve modeling of soil moisture and the surface
   energy budget. This study presents a new variational land system used to
   assimilate AMSR-E brightness temperature of vertical polarization of 6.9
   GHz and 18.7 GHz. The system consists of a land surface model (LSM) used
   to calculate surface fluxes and soil moisture, a radiative transfer
   model (RTM) to estimate the microwave brightness temperature, and an
   optimization scheme to search for optimal values of soil moisture by
   minimizing the difference between modeled and observed brightness
   temperature. The LSM is an improved simple biosphere model for sparse
   vegetation modeling and the RTM is a Q-h model that can account for the
   effects of surface roughness and vegetation. Several parameters in the
   LSM and RTM can significantly affect the outputs of the land data
   assimilation system but their values are either highly variable or
   unavailable. To solve this problem, we developed a dual-pass
   assimilation technique. Pass 1 inversely estimates the optimal values of
   the model parameters with long-term (similar to months) forcing data and
   brightness temperature data, while Pass 2 estimates the near-surface
   soil moisture in a daily assimilation cycle. This system is driven by
   well-established reanalysis data and global data sets of leaf area
   index, precipitation, and surface radiation, and was tested at a CEOP
   (Coordinate Enhanced Observing Period) reference site on the Tibetan
   Plateau. The system not only detected the effect of precipitation events
   that were missing in the forcing data, but also led to a significant
   improvement in modeling of the surface energy budget.},

Title = {Effects of biochar amendment on net greenhouse gas emissions and soil
   fertility in a double rice cropping system: A 4-year field experiment},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {262},

Month = {JUL 15},
Abstract = {A 4-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of
   biochar amendment on the net greenhouse gas emission (NGHGE), greenhouse
   gas intensity (GHGI), soil fertility and crop yield in a typical double
   rice cropping system in the central subtropics of China, from April 2012
   to April 2016. Three biochar treatments were studied in this experiment,
   with application rates of 0, 24 and 48 t ha(-1) (named CK, LB and HB,
   respectively) using straw-derived biochar applied once at the beginning
   of the experiment. In each treatment, the fluxes of methane (CH4),
   nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) were
   measured using a static chamber/gas chromatography method. Major soil
   fertility properties were also determined throughout the experimental
   period. Biochar amendment was found to persistently decrease annual
   total CH4 emissions by 20 to 51\% in the four years, but increased the
   annual total N2O emissions and Rh by 150 to 190\% and 2 to 19\% in the
   first year and the following three years, respectively. On a 4-year
   average, biochar addition significantly reduced annual NGHGE and GHGI by
   156 to 264\% and 159 to 278\%, respectively (p < 0.05), with much higher
   reduction in the first year than those in the following three years (916
   to 1911\% vs 24 to 51\%) due to soil carbon sequestration from biochar
   addition in the first year. The reduction of NGHGE and GHGI was mainly
   caused by the decrease of CH4 emissions (71 to 74\% contribution), and
   the increase of soil carbon sequestration (25 to 29\% contribution) in
   biochar treatments. Biochar amendment also significantly and
   persistently increased soil pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total
   nitrogen (TSN), and total phosphorus (TSP) by 6 to 14\%, 33 to 61\%, 11
   to 15\%, and 9 to 12\%, respectively (p < 0.05), in the four years.
   Significant increases (p < 0.05) of microbial biomass carbon and
   nitrogen contents were found only in the first year after biochar
   amendment. Soil pH was also increased significantly (p < 0.05) with
   biochar amendment, but showed a declining trend in the four years.
   Annual grain yields for the biochar treatments were enhanced by 1 to
   13\%, with an average of 4 to 7\% in the four years, compared to CK (p =
   0.07-0.26). Compared to the LB treatment, the HB treatment significantly
   decreased average NGHGE and GHGI, and significantly increased average
   soil pH value and TOC content, but there was no significantly difference
   in average TSN, TSP, and yield between LB and HB treatments (p < 0.05).
   The gross margin analysis by considering the profit from rice grain,
   gain for NGHGE, and cost for biochar indicated that the economical
   profit for the LB treatment might be higher than that for the CK and HB
   treatments. Our results suggest that addition of biochar at 24 t ha(-1)
   can be regarded as a consistently effective and economic measure for
   greenhouse gas emission mitigation, and soil fertility improvement, in
   the double rice cropping system.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture variability and the depth of water stored in the arable
   layer of the soil are important topics in agricultural research and
   rangeland management. In this study, we use the distributed
   rainfall-runoff (DR2) model to perform a detailed mapping of topsoil
   moisture status (SMS) in a mountain Mediterranean catchment. This model,
   previously tested in the same study area against the Palmer Z-index, is
   run at monthly scale for the current scenario of land uses and under
   three scenarios that combine the land abandonment and the application of
   the new common agricultural policy (CAP) of the European Union. Under
   the current conditions, runoff yield is scarce and presents a high
   spatial variability when monthly rainfall intensity and depth are low,
   and infiltration processes mainly lead to water storage in the soil.
   When rainfall intensity is high, runoff accumulation along the
   hillslopes controls the depth of available water in the soil, and SMS is
   more homogeneous. On average, scrublands and pasture have the wettest
   values, crops of winter cereal and abandoned fields have intermediate
   conditions, and areas of bare soil and forest have the driest conditions
   all the year around. The abandonment and no revegetation of the low
   productive fields located in steep areas and the collapse of their
   landscape linear elements (LLEs) produce not only an increase of 2.3 \%
   of the overall SMS in the catchment in comparison with the current
   scenario but also an increment of the effective runoff that cross the
   cultivated areas of the lowlands and the runoff depth that reach the
   wetlands, increasing the soil erosion risk and compromising the
   conservation of the lakes. When the new green areas of the CAP are
   installed in the upper part of the fields of the lowlands and around the
   lakes, the runoff depth and thus siltation risk clearly decreases but
   also SMS decreases 1.7 and 1.1 \% considering the current land uses and
   adding revegetation practices in the abandoned fields, respectively.
   Hence, a management scenario where: (1) abandoned fields are covered
   with a dense cover of shrubs, (2) the LLEs are preserved, (3) the green
   areas of the PAC are created, and (4) runoff harvesting practices are
   applied to partially compensate the water deficit, will help to preserve
   the humidity of the soil and will be of interest to keep the
   agricultural land use around the protected lakes of the study area.},

   observations into the Mercator Ocean operational system: focus on the El

Abstract = {Monitoring sea surface salinity (SSS) is important for understanding and
   forecasting the ocean circulation. It is even crucial in the context of
   the intensification of the water cycle. Until recently, SSS was one of
   the less observed essential ocean variables. Only sparse in situ
   observations, mostly closer to 5 m depth than the surface, were
   available to estimate the SSS. The recent satellite ESA Soil Moisture
   and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), NASA Aquarius SAC-D and Soil Moisture Active
   Passive (SMAP) missions have made it possible for the first time to
   measure SSS from space and can bring a valuable additional constraint to
   control the model salinity. Nevertheless, satellite SSS still contains
   some residual biases that must be removed prior to bias correction and
   data assimilation. One of the major challenges of this study is to
   estimate the SSS bias and a suitable observation error for the data
   assimilation system. It was made possible by modifying a 3D-Var bias
   correction scheme and by using the analysis of the residuals and errors
   with an adapted statistical technique. This article presents the design
   and the analysis of an observing system experiment (OSE) conducted with
   the 0.25 degrees resolution Mercator Ocean global analysis and
   forecasting system during the El Nino 2015/16 event. The SSS data
   assimilation constrains the model to be closer to the near-surface
   salinity observations in a coherent way with the other data sets already
   routinely assimilated in an operational context.
   This also shows that the overestimation of E-P is corrected by data
   assimilation through salting in regions where precipitations are higher.
   Globally, the SMOS SSS assimilation has a positive impact in salinity
   over the top 30 m. Comparisons to independent salinity data sets show a
   small but positive impact and corroborate the fact that the impact of
   SMOS SSS assimilation is larger in the Intertropical Convergence Zone
   (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) regions. There is
   little impact on the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface
   height (SSH) error statistics. Nevertheless, the SSH seems to be
   impacted by the tropical instability wave (TIW) propagation, itself
   linked to changes in barrier layer thickness (BLT).
   Finally, this study helped us to progress in the understanding of the
   biases and errors that can degrade the SMOS SSS data assimilation
   performance.},

Abstract = {Field experiments were conducted during rainy seasons of three
   consecutive years (2008-2010) to study the effect of green leaf manuring
   on dry matter partitioning and productivity of lowland rice (Oryza
   sativa L.). Green leaves of five indigenous agroforestry tree species
   viz., Erythrina indica, Acacia auriculiformis, Alnus nepalensis, Parkia
   roxburghii, and Cassia siamea were treated at 10 t ha(-1) on fresh
   weight basis in rice fields and compared with recommended N-P2O5-K2O
   (80:60:40 kg ha(-1)) and control treatments. During 2008-2009 year,
   yield attributes and rice yield were greater in NPK plots as compared to
   the green-leaf manured ones. However, in the third year, green leaf
   manuring (except that of Alnus) surpassed even the recommended
   N-P2O5-K2O treatment in terms of dry matter production and yield; better
   response was however observed with Erythrina. The soil available N after
   final harvest increased by ca. 14-20 \% in Alnus and Erythrina treated
   plots as compared to the control. Over all, it could be said that
   management of plant residues can have long-term implications apart from
   the desired maintenance of soil organic matter and improving crop yield.},

Journal = {REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2018},

Abstract = {High resolution root-zone soil moisture (SM) maps are important for
   understanding the spatial variability of water availability in
   agriculture, ecosystems research and water resources management.
   Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can flexibly monitor land surfaces with
   thermal and optical imagery at very high spatial resolution (meter
   level, VHR) for most weather conditions. We modified the
   temperature-vegetation triangle approach to transfer it from satellite
   to UAS remote sensing. To consider the effects of the limited coverage
   of UAS mapping, theoretical dry/wet edges were introduced. The new
   method was tested on a bioenergy willow short rotation coppice site
   during growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. We demonstrated that by
   incorporating surface roughness parameters from the
   structure-from-motion in the interpretation of the measured land
   surface-atmosphere temperature gradients, the estimates of SM
   significantly improved. The correlation coefficient between estimated
   and measured SM increased from not significant to 0.69 and the root mean
   square deviation decreased from 0.045 m(3).m(-3) to 0.025 m(3).m(-3)
   when considering temporal dynamics of surface roughness in the approach.
   The estimated SM correlated better with in-situ root-zone SM (15-30 cm)
   than with surface SM (0-5 cm) which is an important advantage over
   alternative remote sensing methods to estimate SM. The optimal spatial
   resolution of the triangle approach was found to be around 1.5 m, i.e.
   similar to the length scale of tree-crowns. This study highlights the
   importance of considering the 3-D fine scale canopy structure, when
   addressing the links between surface temperature and SM patterns via
   surface energy balances. Our methodology can be applied to operationally
   monitor VHR root-zone SM from UAS in agricultural and natural
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Improving numerical weather prediction was one of the main
   justifications for National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil
   Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) Mission. The ensemble Kalman filter
   (EnKF) has been extensively applied to assimilate the SM observations
   into numerical weather predication models. Implementation of EnKF
   requires the observations and model simulations to be Gaussian
   distributed and not biased from each other. In this letter, we tested
   the impacts of three bias-correction methods on effectiveness of
   assimilating SMAP retrievals into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
   Administration-National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global
   Forecast System (GFS). They are: 1) global cumulative distribution
   function (CDF) matching with only one CDF for all grids and time series;
   2) monthly CDF matching with one CDF for each grid; 3) the linear
   transformation technique that matches monthly mean and standard
   deviation of the SMAP retrievals and model simulations for each grid;
   and 4) assimilating SMAP SM data into GFS without any bias-correction
   procedure. With respect to the global land data assimilation (DA) system
   precipitation product, the results demonstrate that the effectiveness of
   assimilating SMAP retrievals into GFS is significantly impacted by the
   bias-correction methods. Relative to other DA cases, the monthly CDF
   matching produces the best precipitation forecast performance.
   Improvements of the three-hourly GFS precipitation prediction with SMAP
   assimilation using the monthly CDF matching can reach to 8\% and 10\% in
   sparsely and densely vegetated areas, respectively, and marginally
   positive in medium vegetation areas. Based on these results,
   assimilating SMAP retrievals into the GFS with the EnKF algorithm using
   the monthly CDF matching method is suggested for enhancing accuracy of
   the precipitation forecasts.},

Abstract = {Most of the wildfires in upland Britain occur in Spring, with the
   highest peak in April. However, the highest values of the Met Office
   Fire Severity Index (MOFSI, based on the Canadian Forest Fire Weather
   Index System) occur in the height of summer, thus successfully
   predicting extreme fire weather conditions, but failing to predict when
   the majority of real fires occur. Here we illustrate this discrepancy
   with data from the English Peak District, and present an alternative
   model which calculates a proposed shrub fire index (SFI) and compares it
   with randomly generated numbers to simulate fire occurrence. The major
   peaks in the SFI dynamics occur in spring, reflecting the effect of
   drought stress on shrubs caused by damaged leaf cuticles during winter
   and the lack of resources to alleviate the damage during the
   pre-green-up period. The model presented here shows a reasonable
   performance in reproducing the seasonal distribution of wild fire
   occurrence, and may therefore prove helpful for future development of a
   fire prediction system designed specifically for British conditions. An
   effective wildfire prediction system will have great value for
   increasing the preparedness of land managers, National Park Authority
   staff and the Fire and Rescue Services. A weather index that accurately
   predicts the fuel moisture content of the dominant shrubs will also be
   valuable to land managers who use prescribed fire for vegetation
   management.},

Abstract = {Impact of 26 years of integrated nutrient management through application
   of chemical fertilizers and organic materials (farm yard manure, wheat
   straw and green manuring) on soil properties, soil fertility, nutrient
   uptake and crop yields under pearl millet-wheat cropping system was
   studied at Research Farm of CCSHAU, Hisar. The experiment consisted of
   five treatments viz., control, chemical fertilizers alone (100\% NP),
   and fertilizers in combination with organic materials to substitute 50\%
   N through farm yard manure (50\% NP+FYM), wheat straw (50\% NP+WS) and
   green manuring (50\% NP+GM). Continuous use of FYM, WS and GM in
   conjunction with fertilizers increased the fertility status, NPK uptake,
   and yield of pearl millet and wheat crops. The soil reaction and soluble
   salts were found invariant under different treatments after the harvest
   of wheat. Among the organic materials, FYM resulted in highest available
   N (220.5 kg/ha), P (21.0 kg/ha) and K (333.8 kg/ha) in soil, and yielded
   highest grain yield of pearl millet (3142 kg/ha) and wheat (5452 kg/ha).
   These yields were not different with the yields obtained with the
   application of chemical fertilizer alone. Continuous application of FYM
   to meet 50\% N requirement of pearl miller resulted in highest increase
   in plant height, dry matter accumulation, number of grains per
   earhead/spike and test weight of both the crops as compared to other
   treatments. Study suggests that long term integrated use of chemical
   fertilizers and organic materials has great potential for improving soil
   productivity and achieving higher crop productivity under pearl
   millet-wheat cropping system in arid and semi-arid climatic conditions.},

Abstract = {Water determines the success of coffee farming, since it influences the
   phenology of the plant and, consequently, its productivity, product
   quality and commercial viability. The Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR)
   associated with the monitoring of soil water content (theta)
   distinguishes management systems as to their effectiveness in supplying
   water to plants. The need for developing better management systems -in
   Brazilian rainfed farming that promote water uptake by coffee plant
   radicular systems at lower soil depths where water is more available,
   inspired this study. This work had as an objective to evaluate the
   availability of water in soil through LLWR limits in association with
   leaf water potential, as well as growth and yield of coffee plants, in
   the Cerrado region of Southeastern Brazil over 4 years. The management
   systems evaluated were: CV-0 (conventional management with coffee
   interrow maintained with bare soil); G-28 (conservation management, with
   maintenance of Brachiaria in interrow, ridging and additional
   application of 28 Mg ha(-1) gypsum applied in the rows) and G-7 (same as
   G-28, except for an additional application of 7 Mg ha(-1) of gypsum).
   theta was monitored every 15 days. Critical moisture for coffee crop in
   each phenological stage was added as the lowest limit of LLWR. In all
   evaluated management systems, theta was below the critical moisture as
   measured at the soil depths of 0.20 m and 0.60 m. At 1.00 m depth in the
   CV-0 management system, the greatest value of theta was found, which
   caused the assumption of smaller water uptake. Regardless of the
   management adopted, the leaf water potential reached -1.16 MPa in August
   2010, but that did not cause water stress high enough to reduce
   productivity. At 0.60 m depth, the lowest value for theta between rows
   was observed for the G-28 management system. Plants showed a more
   accentuated initial growth in the CV-0 management system. Each
   management system showed distinct behavior regarding productivity of the
   evaluated crops: in 2011, CV-0 had the highest productivity, but, in
   2012, productivity was greater for G-7 and G-28.},

   a Semi-Arid Region},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2016},

Abstract = {Improving the capability of land-surface process models to simulate soil
   moisture assists in better understanding the atmosphere-land
   interaction. In semi-arid regions, due to limited near-surface
   observational data and large errors in large-scale parameters obtained
   by the remote sensing method, there exist uncertainties in land surface
   parameters, which can cause large offsets between the simulated results
   of land-surface process models and the observational data for the soil
   moisture. In this study, observational data from the Semi-Arid Climate
   Observatory and Laboratory (SACOL) station in the semi-arid loess
   plateau of China were divided into three datasets: summer, autumn, and
   summer-autumn. By combing the particle swarm optimization (PSO)
   algorithm and the land-surface process model SHAW (Simultaneous Heat and
   Water), the soil and vegetation parameters that are related to the soil
   moisture but difficult to obtain by observations are optimized using
   three datasets. On this basis, the SHAW model was run with the optimized
   parameters to simulate the characteristics of the land-surface process
   in the semi-arid loess plateau. Simultaneously, the default SHAW model
   was run with the same atmospheric forcing as a comparison test.
   Simulation results revealed the following: parameters optimized by the
   particle swarm optimization algorithm in all simulation tests improved
   simulations of the soil moisture and latent heat flux; differences
   between simulated results and observational data are clearly reduced,
   but simulation tests involving the adoption of optimized parameters
   cannot simultaneously improve the simulation results for the net
   radiation, sensible heat flux, and soil temperature. Optimized soil and
   vegetation parameters based on different datasets have the same order of
   magnitude but are not identical; soil parameters only vary to a small
   degree, but the variation range of vegetation parameters is large.},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a consideration for soil conservation, agricultural
   production and climate modelling. This article presents a simple method
   for estimating soil moisture storage under water stress and storage
   depletion conditions. The method is driven by the common agro-hydrologic
   variables of precipitation (PPT), irrigation (IRR) and
   evapotranspiration (ET). The proposed method is successfully tested for
   the 152 000 km(2) floodplain region of Hai River Basin using 48
   consecutive months (2003-2006) of data. Soil moisture data from global
   land data assimilation system/Noah land surface model are validated with
   ground-truth data from 102 soil moisture monitoring sites. The validated
   soil moisture is used in combination with in situ groundwater data to
   quantify total water storage change (TWSC) in the region. The estimated
   storage change is in turn compared with gravity recovery and climate
   experiment-derived TWSC for the study area. The soil moisture and TWSC
   terms show favourable agreements, with discrepancies of < 10\% on the
   average. While there is no consistent seasonal trend in soil moisture,
   TWSC shows a strong seasonality. It is low in spring and high in summer.
   This trend corresponds with the IRR-PPT season in the study area. Change
   in groundwater and total water storage indicates storage depletion in
   the basin. Storage depletion in the region is driven mainly by
   groundwater IRR and ET loss. Despite the low PPT and high ET, there is
   narrowing seasonal trend in soil moisture. This is achieved at the
   expense of groundwater storage. IRR pumping has induced extensive
   groundwater depletion in the basin. It is therefore vital to develop
   cultivation strategies that aim at limiting IRR pumping and ET loss.
   Water management practices that not only reduce waste but also ensure
   high productivity and ecological sustainability could also mitigate
   storage depletion in the region. These measures could reduce further not
   only the seasonal trend in soil moisture but also that in groundwater
   storage. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Title = {SMAP, RS-DTVGM, and in-situ monitoring: Which performs best in
   presenting the soil moisture in the middle-high latitude frozen area in
   the Sanjiang Plain, China?},

Abstract = {Soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle-high
   latitude frozen area, which occupies approximately 30\% of the global
   land area. The Sanjiang Plain, an important commercial grain production
   area, is the largest swampy low plain in a middle-high latitude frozen
   area in China. However, no published studies on this region have
   clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in-situ measurements;
   the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown. In this
   study, we compared the ability of the SMAP product, a RSDTVGM model, and
   two self-erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil
   moisture information in the Sanjiang Plain by using the Triple
   Collocation method. Soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous
   days, and the data period was divided into three frozen periods (FT) and
   two non-frozen (NFT) periods. Valid data supply rates of the three
   methods were also calculated and compared. From the Triple Collocation
   method, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SMAP, model and in-situ
   monitoring data sets were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.05. The valid data supply
   rates of the SMAP product in the FT and NFT periods were 27.1\% and
   57.5\%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the
   SMAP product and the in-situ monitoring dataset was 0.301 for the FT
   period and 0.557 for the NFT period. The RS-DTVGM model had a data
   supply rate of 100\%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for this model
   was 0.101 for the FT period, but reached 0.726 for the NFT period. For
   the three soil moisture data sets, the accuracy ranking in this
   middle-high latitude area was SMAP > in-situ monitoring > model
   simulation. Although neither SMAP nor the RS-DTVGM model could capture
   the real soil moisture information for the FT period, both could
   accurately simulate the soil moisture in the NFT period. The results
   from the RS-DTVGM model demonstrated a closer relationship with in-situ
   soil moisture measurement data relative to the SMAP method. The in-situ
   method provided accurate soil moisture data, but its application is
   limited by high cost. In the future, the data from the three methods
   should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high
   accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important
   area.},

Title = {Management of soil phosphorus fertility determines the phosphorus budget
   of a temperate grazing system and is the key to improving phosphorus
   efficiency},
Journal = {AGRICULTURE ECOSYSTEMS \& ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {212},

Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {The phosphorus (P) efficiency of fertilised grazing systems on P
   deficient soils is often very low. P budgets (P input vs P output) were
   developed to examine P use in a long-term experiment in which grazing
   systems were managed with contrasting soil test P concentrations: (i) no
   P-fertiliser (PO; Olsen P = 2-5 mg/kg), (ii) near-optimum soil P
   fertility (P1; Olsen P = 10-15 mg/kg), (iii) supra-optimal P fertility
   (P2; Olsen P = 20-25 mg/kg), or (iv) with variable? fertility. Pastures
   were grazed with either 9 or 18 sheep/ha. P was exported as liveweight
   gain in sheep removed from the fields. Fertilised fields accumulated
   89-93\% of their P input over the whole P-budgeting period (1994-2006).
   However, this included P that was contributing to a ``build up{''} in
   soil fertility (1994-2000). The efficiency of P fertiliser use was
   better demonstrated by P budgets during a soil P fertility
   ``maintenance{''} phase (2001-2006) in which P inputs and soil test P
   concentrations of the grazing system treatments were relatively stable.
   When the amounts of P associated with the small changes in soil
   fertility were accounted for, the accumulation of P was 4352 kg P/ha
   (83-87\% of P inputs) in P1 fields and 87 kg P/ha (88\% of P inputs) in
   P2 fields over the six-year period. Differences due to stocking rate
   were relatively small. Audits of the total Pin sheep camp soil and field
   soil demonstrated that sheep camps were not a major sink for the P that
   was accumulating in the grazed fields. P was mainly accumulated in soil
   in the non-camp area of fields when they were fertilised and this was
   the major reason for low P-balance efficiency. It was concluded that the
   annual rate of P accumulation in fertilised soil (due mainly to
   P-sorption reactions) was higher when soil is being maintained at higher
   extractable-P concentrations. Consequently, strategies that can achieve
   equivalent pasture production with lower concentrations of extractable-P
   in the soil should reduce the amount of P fertiliser necessary for high
   production. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. All

Title = {Spatial zoning of microbial functions and plant-soil nitrogen dynamics
   across a riparian area in an extensively grazed livestock system},
Journal = {SOIL BIOLOGY \& BIOCHEMISTRY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {120},
Pages = {153-164},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have significantly altered global
   biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycling leading to major environmental
   problems such as freshwater eutrophication, biodiversity loss and
   enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. The soils in the riparian interface
   between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems may prevent excess N from
   entering freshwaters (e.g. via plant uptake, microbial transformations
   and denitrification). Although these processes are well documented in
   intensively managed agroecosystems, our understanding of riparian N
   removal in semi-natural systems remains poor. Our aim was to assess the
   spatial zoning of soil microbial communities (PLFA), N cycling gene
   abundance (archaeal and bacterial amoA, nifH, nirK, nirS, nos2), N
   processing rates and plant N uptake across an extensively sheep grazed
   riparian area. As expected, soil properties differed greatly across the
   riparian transect, with significant decreases in organic matter, NH4+,
   carbon (C) and N content closest to the river ( <10 m). In addition,
   different microbial community structures were found along the transect.
   The abundance of N fixation (nifH) increased with distance from the
   river (>10m), while ammonia oxidising archaea (AOA) increased in
   abundance towards the river. N2O emissions rates were limited by C and
   to a lesser extent by N with greater emissions close to the river. Plant
   uptake of urea-derived N-15 was high (ca. 55-70\% of that added to the
   soil) but 30-65\% of the N was potentially lost by denitrification or
   leaching. Percentage recovered also suggests that the spatial patterning
   of plant and microbial N removal processes are different across the
   riparian zone. Our study provides novel insights into the underlying
   mechanisms controlling the spatial variability of N cycling in
   semi-natural riparian ecosystems.},

Title = {A Comparative Study of Integrated Crop Management System vs.
   Conventional Crop Management System for Cotton Yield and Fiber Quality
   With Respect to Fruiting Position Under Different Soil Fertility Levels},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {9},
Month = {AUG 3},
Abstract = {In order to increase cotton productivity and optimize fiber quality on
   limited arable land, an integrated crop management system (ICMS), which
   combined with some optimal management practices, is projected to replace
   the conventional crop management system (CCMS) for cotton production in
   the Yangtze River valley. The seedcotton yield and fiber quality with
   respect to fruiting position under ICMS and CCMS were investigated in
   2012 and 2013 in two fields differing in soil fertility. Reduced bolls
   on fruiting branches 1-10 (FB1-10) and at fruiting position 1-2 (FP1-2)
   on FB11-15 could not be fully compensated by increased bolls on FB16+
   under CCMS, resulting in more seedcotton yield under ICMS relative to
   that under CCMS. Fiber at majority fruiting positions under CCMS were
   longer and stronger than those under ICMS, but CCMS increased the
   contribution of bolls on FB11+ to the cotton yield, which overall
   resulted in no significant change in fiber length and strength by
   management system at field level. The number of bolls at FP1-2 on FB1-5
   under CCMS while the number of bolls on FB1-5 and at FP1-2 on FB1-5 were
   not significantly changed by soil fertility, resulting in diminished
   yield difference in soil fertility among ICMS relative to that of CCMS.
   The high soil fertility significantly increased seedcotton yield
   relative to low soil fertility, which was attributed to more number of
   bolls on FB11+ and higher seedcotton weight per boll at all fruiting
   positions. High soil fertility field not only recorded superior fiber
   quality on FB11+, but also increased the contribution of these bolls to
   the cotton yield relative to those in the low soil fertility field,
   resulting in no significant change in overall fiber quality among soil
   fertility. These findings demonstrate that by combining optimal
   management practices on infertile soils ICMS could minimize the yield
   differences due to soil fertility without sacrificing fiber quality.},

Abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial factor in understanding the
   hydrological cycle and is essential to many applications in hydrology,
   ecology and water resources management. However, reliable ET
   measurements and predictions for a range of temporal and spatial scales
   are difficult. This study focused on the comparison of ET estimates
   using a relatively simple model, the Priestley-Taylor (P-T) approach,
   and the physically based Common Land Model (CLM) using ground and
   remotely sensed soil moisture data as input. The results from both
   models were compared directly with hourly eddy covariance measurements
   at two agricultural field sites during the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere
   Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) in the corn soybean production region in
   the Upper Midwest, USA. The P-T model showed a significant
   overestimation of the potential ET compared to the measurements, with a
   root mean square error (RMSE) between 115 and 130 W m(-2). Actual ET was
   better predicted by the CLM, with the RMSE ranging between 50 and 75 W
   m(-2). However, actual ET from the P-T model constrained with a soil
   moisture dependency parameterization showed improved results when
   compared to the measurements, with a significantly reduced bias and RMSE
   values between 60 and 65 W m(-2). This study suggests that even with a
   simple semi-empirical ET model, similar performance in estimating actual
   ET for agricultural crops compared to more complex land
   surface-atmosphere models (i.e. the CLM) can be achieved when
   constrained with the soil moisture function. This suggests that remote
   sensing soil moisture estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning
   Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and others such as the Soil
   Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission may be effective alternatives
   under certain environmental conditions for estimating actual ET of
   agricultural crops using a fairly simple algorithm.},

Abstract = {Balanced fertilization is one of the key input for maintaining
   productivity and sustainability of the food production systems. For
   assessing the impact of nutrient omissions on grain yield, nutrient
   uptake pattern, soil nutrient balance and fertilizer requirement for
   targeted yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), a field experiment on
   nutrient omission plot technique was conducted during 2010-11 and
   2011-12. The treatments comprised omission of nitrogen, phosphorus,
   potassium and zinc, 50\% omission of N, P, and K, absolute control (no
   nutrient applied) and optimum nutrition (150-26.4-50-15-3 kg/ha of
   N-P-K-S-Zn). The reduction in the grain yield due to N, P and K omission
   was 35.0\%, 9.6\% and 3.0\% during the year 2010-11, which further
   increased to 49\%, 11.5\% and 7.4\% during the year 2011-12,
   respectively. The reduction in N, P and K uptake was more drastic in the
   N omission treatment, mainly due to the reduced dry matter accumulation.
   The agronomic efficiency (AE) and apparent recovery (AR) of N, P and K
   was higher when applied at 50\% of their recommended level. On the basis
   of the indigenous supply, nutrient uptake and apparent recovery
   efficiency (AR) of N, P and K estimated in this study, the N:P2O5:K2O
   dose needed to attain a yield target of 4.5, 5.0 and 5.5 tonnes/ha wheat
   grain yield worked out at 155:37:45, 188:79:83 and 220:106:121 kg/ha,

Title = {A comparison of two methods for estimating surface soil moisture based
   on the triangle model using optical/thermal infrared remote sensing over
   the source area of the Yellow River},

Abstract = {As an important surface parameter, surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a
   significant role in water resources management, crop growth, land
   degradation, and vegetation coverage as well as global climate change
   studies. In particular, the triangle model based on the spatial
   relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation
   index from optical/thermal infrared remote sensing data has been widely
   used for the estimation of SSM. In the present study, Moderate
   Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data,
   including the MOD11A2 LST and MOD13A2 normalised differential vegetation
   index (NDVI) from July to October, 2008 to 2010, over the source area of
   the Yellow River (SAYR) in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan
   Plateau, are selected to construct the LST/NDVI triangle space. Two
   methods based on the triangle space, namely, the temperature vegetation
   drought index (TVDI) method and second order polynomial method, is used
   to estimate the SSM at the regional scale. Finally, an analysis between
   the estimated SSM and ground-measured SSM is carried out to explore not
   only the quality of these two methods in triangle space but also the
   applicability of these two methods in the alpine vegetation region of
   the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the spatial distribution of SSM in the
   study area is investigated. The results of the validation of the
   estimated SSM results using ground-measured data show that the accuracy
   of the second order polynomial method is significantly higher than that
   of the TVDI method. The TVDI method root mean square error (RMSE) is
   0.072m(3)m(-3), coefficient of determination R-2 is 0.461, and bias is
   -0.022m(3)m(-3), while the second order polynomial method RMSE is
   0.075m(3)m(-3), R-2 is 0.519, and bias is 0.007m(3)m(-3). Moreover, the
   SSM decreases from west to the east; this distribution can be obtained
   with the estimated results by using either of the two methods. In
   addition, the SSM estimations by using the two methods are in good
   correlation with the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture
   product. The present study indicates that the second order polynomial
   method can simulate the change in SSM in the triangle space more
   realistically and effectively and that the second order polynomial
   method is more suitable for the estimation of SSM over the alpine
   vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau.},

Title = {Water hyacinth {[}<i>Eichhornia crassipes</i> (Mart.) Solms.] engineered
   soil nutrient availability in a low-land rain-fed rice farming system of
   north-east India},

Abstract = {A study was conducted to investigate the mulch role of water hyacinth
   (Eichhornia crassipes) on soil properties of a lowland rain-fed rice
   farming system in north-east India. The green mulch had higher carbon
   and nutrient contents as compared to its compost and vermicompost forms,
   and so were the hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Significant
   reduction in C/N ratio from fresh water hyacinth indicated rapid N
   release while composting. Over all, mulching significantly (p < 0.05)
   increased soil C, total N, available P and K as compared to the
   non-mulched plots. Nonetheless, soil C was greater in the green mulch
   plots, followed by compost and vermicompost plots. Net N mineralization
   rate also followed similar patterns. Upon comparison with other aquatic
   weedy species, E. crassipes had 20-50\% more C and 10-40\% more N in its
   residues. Likewise, the compost prepared out of E. crassipes also seems
   to be of good quality as indicated by a C/N ratio less than 25, as
   compared to Hydrilla spp., Najas spp., Ottelia spp. and Pistia
   stratiotes. It is therefore suggested that recycling of water hyacinth
   can be an ecofriendly aquatic weed management strategy to improve soil
   health and nutrient redistribution through a faster turnover that can
   engineer sustainable agricultural production in the tropical soils. (C)

Abstract = {Continuous adoption of rice-wheat cropping system (RWCS) has led to
   depletion of inherent soil fertility resulting in a serious threat to
   its sustainability in the Indo-Gangetic plain region (IGPR) of India.
   The inclusion of legumes in RWCS assumes a great significance to restore
   soil fertility. But farmers in the IGPR rarely grow legumes in the
   system. We, therefore, carried out farmers' participatory diagnostic
   survey in the Upper Gangetic plain zone (UGP) to understand farmers'
   fertilizer management practices for wheat (Trititicum aestivum L. Emend
   Fiori \& Paol) following rice (Oryza sativa L.) or pigeonpea (Cajanus
   cajan(L)Millsp). The survey indicated that most of the farmers in UGP
   grew pigeonpea in place of rice under RWCS as only a break crop at a 2-3
   year interval. The farmers applied, on average, 11 kg N ha(-1) and 24 kg
   P ha(-1) to wheat sown after rice, and 12 kg N ha(-1) and 19 kg P ha(-1)
   to wheat sown after pigeonpea. Wheat yields, however, were lower (3.3 t
   ha(-1)) when sown after pigeonpea than after rice (3.7 t ha(-1)). The
   survey was followed by a field experiment at Modipuram (29degrees 4' N),
   Meerut, India that continued during the three consecutive years
   (1998-1999 to 2000-2001) to examine the effect of inclusion of pigeonpea
   in place of rice on soil fertility, N and P use efficiency and yields of
   wheat. In 1998-1999, wheat yields after pigeonpea were lower than after
   rice, but improved significantly (p < 0.05) by 11.4-15.1\% in pigeonpea
   plots compared with those in rice plots during 1999-2000 and 2000-2001,
   respectively. The use efficiency of applied N and P fertilizers in
   wheat, measured as agronomic efficiency and apparent recovery, was
   increased with combined use of fertilizer N and P at recommended rate,
   and also with inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice. The post-wheat
   harvest NO3-N in soil profile beyond 45 cm depth was significantly
   greater under rice-wheat system than under pigeonpea-wheat system,
   suggesting that inclusion of pigeonpea may help in minimizing NO3-N
   leaching to deeper profile layers beyond root zone. Similarly, in the
   treatments receiving both 120 kg N and 26 kg P ha(-1), NO3-N beyond 45
   cm soil depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone.
   Inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice enhanced carbon accumulation in
   the soil profile. The available P content was, however, invariably low
   under pigeonpea plots as compared to that under rice. With continuous
   rice-wheat cropping, the bulk density (BD) of soil was increased,
   especially in the 30-45 cm soil profile. Inclusion of pigeonpea in the
   system not only helped maintaining soil BD at initial level in the
   surface (0-15 cm) soil layers, but also in decreasing (p < 0.05) BD in
   sub-surface layers (15-30 cm and 3045 cm). Compared to rice, a
   statistically significant (p < 0.05) positive effect of pigeonpea on
   root volume (58\%) and root weight (99.5\%) of succeeding wheat was also
   recorded. The net economic returns under pigeonpea-wheat system were
   greater compared with rice-wheat system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {In this study, the variations in surface soil liquid water (SSLW) due to
   future climate change are explored in the `Huang-Huai-Hai Plain' ('3H')
   region in China with the Common Land Model (CoLM). To evaluate the
   possible maximum response of SSLW to climate change, the combination of
   the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to the parameter
   (CNOP-P) approach and projections from 10 general circulation models
   (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) are used.
   The CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario, a new type of temperature
   change scenario, is determined by using the CNOP-P method and
   constrained by the temperature change projections from the 10 GCMs under
   a high-emission scenario (the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5
   scenario). Numerical results have shown that the response of SSLW to the
   CNOP-P-type temperature scenario is stronger than those to the 11
   temperature scenarios derived from the 10 GCMs and from their ensemble
   average in the entire `3H' region. In the northern region, SSLW under
   the CNOP-P-type scenario increases to 0.1773 m(3) m(aEuro'3); however,
   SSLW in the scenarios from the GCMs fluctuates from 0.1671 to 0.1748
   m(3) m(aEuro'3). In the southern region, SSLW decreases, and its
   variation (-0.0070 m(3) m(aEuro'3)) due to the CNOP-P-type scenario is
   higher than each of the variations (-0.0051 to -0.0026 m(3) m(aEuro'3))
   due to the scenarios from the GCMs.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted for 6 years during 2005-10 to study the
   effect of nutrient management practices on the productivity, economics
   and soil fertility of castor (Ricinus communis L.) - sorghum (Sorghum
   bicolor (L.) Moench.) cropping system in rainfed Alfisols of southern
   Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh. Application of recommended dose of
   NPK for castor (60-40-30 kg/ha) recorded higher seed yield (1 614 kg/ha)
   which was comparable with NPK + 5 tonnes FYM/ha (1 589 kg/ha) and 75 \%
   NPK + 25 \% N through FYM (1 512 kg/ha). Whereas for sorghum,
   recommended NPK (60-30-30 kg/ha) + 5 tonnes FYM/ha recorded higher
   sorghum seed yield (3 147 kg/ha) which was comparable with the
   treatment, recommended dose of NPK (2 718 kg/ha) and 75\% NPK + 25\% N
   through FYM (2 696 kg/ha). Imbalanced application of N alone or NP or 50
   \% NPK and control plots recorded significantly the lowest seed yields
   of both crops. Response to zinc application was observed only in third
   crop cycle of sorghum. The system productivity in terms of castor
   equivalent yield (CEY) was the highest in NPK + 5 tonnes FYM/ha

Abstract = {Global Level-3 surface soil moisture (SM) maps derived from the passive
   microwave SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) observations at L-band
   have recently been released. In this study, a comparative analysis of
   this Level 3 product (referred to as SMOSL3) along with another Surface
   SM (SSM) product derived from the observations of the Advanced Microwave
   Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) at C-band is presented (this latter product
   is referred to as AMSRM). SM-DAS-2, a SSM product produced by the
   European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Land Data
   Assimilation System (LDAS) was used to monitor both SMOSL3 and AMSRM
   qualities. The present study was carried out from 03/2010 to 09/2011, a
   period during which both SMOS and AMSR-E products were available at
   global scale. Three statistical metrics were used for the evaluation;
   the correlation coefficient (R), the Root Mean Squared Difference
   (RMSD), and the bias. Results were analysed using maps of biomes and
   Leaf Area Index (LAI). It is shown that both SMOSL3 and AMSRM captured
   well the spatio-temporal variability of SM-DAS-2 for most of the biomes.
   In terms of correlation values, the SMOSL3 product was found to better
   capture the SSM temporal dynamics in highly vegetated biomes
   ({''}tropical humid{''}, ``temperate humid{''}, etc.) while best results
   for AMSRM were obtained over arid and semi-arid biomes ({''}desert
   temperate{''}, ``desert tropical{''}, etc.). Finally, we showed that the
   accuracy of the remotely sensed SSM products is strongly related to LAI.
   Both the SMOSL3 and AMSRM (marginally better) SSM products correlated
   well with the SM-DAS-2 product over regions with sparse vegetation for
   values of LAI <= 1 (these regions represent almost 50\% of the pixels
   considered in this global study). In regions where LAI>1, SMOSL3 showed
   better correlations with SM-DAS-2 than AMSRM: SMOSL3 had a consistent
   performance up to LAI = 6, whereas the AMSRM performance deteriorated
   with increasing values of LAI. This study reveals that SMOS and AMSR-E
   complement one another in monitoring SSM over a wide range in conditions
   of vegetation density and that there are valuable satellite observed SSM
   data records over more than 10 years, which can be used to study land
   atmosphere processes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, a major deterrent to large scale
   adoption of the otherwise advantageous pigeonpea-wheat cropping system
   is the poor crop stand of pigeonpea due to temporary water logging
   during the rainy (monsoon) season, leading to its low productivity and a
   smaller residual effect on the succeeding wheat crop. The permanent
   raised bed (PRB) system of planting, as widely used particularly for
   wheat in different countries, has seldom been studied in the
   pigeonpea-wheat system. We, therefore, conducted a field experiment at
   Modipuram (29 degrees 4'N, 77 degrees 46'E, 237 m asl), India, for 3
   consecutive years (2001-02 to 2003-04) to evaluate the PRB vis-A-vis the
   conventional flat bed (FB) system of planting at varying fertilizer NP
   rates in the pigeonpea-wheat system, in terms of changes in soil organic
   carbon, nutrient and water use efficiencies, annual productivity and
   economic returns. Pigeonpea grown on PRB had lower plant mortality
   (4-7\%) and higher yield (1.6-2.1 t ha(-1))as compared to FB with
   26-36\% mortality and yield of 1.3-1.8 it ha(-1). Pigeonpea on PRB had
   greater N and P recycling (11-23\% N and 8-14\% P) through its residue
   comprising root, stubble and leaf litter. Although wheat yield following
   pigeonpea under PRB was lower (p < 0.05) compared with that under FB,
   the system productivity in terms of wheat equivalent yield was 8.44\%
   higher under PRB. The economic optimum doses of fertilizer N and P for
   wheat in the pigeonpea-wheat system were smaller (128 kg N and 28 kg P
   ha-1) under PRB as compared to FB (152 kg N and 30 kg P ha-1) owing to
   increased N and P supply, greater P use efficiency and a better crop
   growth environment under PRB planting. The N use efficiency indices were
   significantly greater (p < 0.05) in wheat under FB compared to those
   under PRB. By contrast, P use efficiency was greater under PRB,
   particularly in treatments that received both N and P fertilizers.
   Compared with FB, the root mass density (20-46\%) of wheat was also
   greater under PRB in surface and sub-surface soil layers. PRB favored
   saving of irrigation water by 9.5-13.4 ha cm and improved the irrigation
   application efficiency by 9.5-13.4\% and the irrigation use efficiency
   by 1928 kg ha cm(-1) over FB. The post-wheat harvest nitrate N (NO3-N)
   at 20-40 cm soil depth in plots fertilized with 120 or 180 kg N ha(-1)
   was greater under FB planting (10.25-13.81 mg kg(-1)) compared to PRB
   (7.33-8.42 mg kg(-1)), suggesting that PRB planting might reduce NO3-N
   leaching to deeper soil layers. Similarly, in the treatments that
   received both N and P, NO3-N in soil below 20 cm depth was lower
   compared to those receiving N or P alone. After three crop cycles, soil
   OC and the Olsen-P content in the 0-20 cm depth were increased compared
   to the initial content under both planting techniques but the magnitude
   of increase was greater under PRB. Compared with FB, the annual net
   returns of the pigeonpea-wheat system were greater by US\$ 210 ha-1
   under PRB, and the crop also required less specific energy (1.99 MJ
   kg(-1)) compared with the FB planting (3.18 MJ kg(-1)). (C) 2009

Abstract = {Field experiments were conducted on cotton to evaluate the different
   cotton-based intercropping system along with balanced nutrient
   management practices on enhancing cotton productivity. Cropping systems
   have been considered as main plots and nutrient management practices
   have been considered as subplots. The results showed that cotton + onion
   system recorded the highest cotton equivalent yield (CEY) of 2052 and
   1895kgha(-1) which was on par with cotton intercropped with dhaincha,
   which recorded 2010 and 1894kg of CEY ha(-1) in both the seasons.
   Combined application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants (S-5)
   registered highest CEY in both the seasons. Cotton intercropped with
   dhaincha (M-2) recorded highest uptake of N, P, and K. Among the
   nutrient management practices, application of 100\% recommended NPK with
   bioinoculants (S-5) showed highest uptake of N, P, and K. A similar
   trend was noticed in the post-harvest soil fertility too and it is
   significantly higher under cotton + dhaincha and application of 100\%
   recommended NPK with bioinoculants treatment compared to 100\% recommend
   NPK alone. It could be concluded from these results that crop
   productivity can be improved and soil fertility status can be sustained

Title = {Transgenic Peanut (<i>Arachis</i> <i>hypogaea</i> L.) Overexpressing

Abstract = {Peanut, an important oilseed crop, frequently encounters drought stress
   (DS) during its life cycle. In this study, four previously developed
   mtlD transgenic (T) peanut lines were used for detailed characterization
   under DS, at the reproductive stage using lysimeter system under
   controlled greenhouse conditions. In dry-down experiments, T lines
   maintained better photosynthetic machinery, such as, photosynthesis
   rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and SPAD (Soil-Plant
   Analyses Development) values, and had lower oxidative damage, including
   lipid membrane peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical
   accumulation than WT, when exposed to 24 days of DS. WT plants had a
   more negative water potential (WP; up to -3.22 MPa) than T lines did
   (-2.56 to -2.71 MPa) at day 24 of DS treatment. During recovery, T lines
   recovered easily whereas 67\% of WT plants failed to recover. In T
   lines, the rate of photosynthesis strongly and positively correlated
   with the transpiration rate (r = 0.92), RWC (r = 0.90), WP (r = 0.86),
   and total chlorophyll content (r = 0.75), suggesting its strong
   correlation with water retention-related parameters. Furthermore, yield
   parameters such as, pod weight and harvest index of T lines were up to
   2.19 and 1.38 times more than those of WT plants, respectively. Thus,
   the significantly better performance of mtlD T peanut lines than of WT
   plants under DS could be attributed to the accumulation of mannitol,
   which in turn helped in maintaining the osmoregulation and ROS
   scavenging activity of mannitol and ultimately conferred
   water-economizing capacity and higher yield in T lines than in WT
   plants.},

Abstract = {In many operational numerical weather prediction applications, the soil
   moisture analysis is based on the modeled first-guess and screen-level
   variables; that is, 2-m temperature and 2- m relative humidity. A set of
   two global 61-day analysis/forecast experiments based on the Integrated
   Forecast System at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
   Forecasts (ECMWF) has been performed for June and July 2002. Analyses
   and forecasts based on the operational Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme
   are compared against results obtained from an open loop system, in which
   soil moisture evolves freely. It is found that soil moisture
   assimilation or analysis has a significant impact on the model
   atmosphere. Temperature forecasts for the Northern Hemisphere up to a
   level of 700 hPa and up to nine days were significantly improved when
   the operational analysis was used. A comparison of volumetric soil
   moisture against in situ observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet reveals,
   however, that the operational OI system fails to improve both the
   analysis and the subsequent forecast of soil moisture itself. In
   addition, the system is not able to correct soil moisture for errors
   introduced through wrong precipitation in the background forecasts.
   Biweekly observations from the Illinois Climate Network support these
   findings. This study confirms the long assumed ( but rarely proven)
   characteristics of analysis schemes using screen-level variables: The
   observations are efficient in improving the turbulent surface fluxes and
   consequently the weather forecast on large geographical domains. The
   quality of the resulting soil moisture profile is often not sufficient
   for hydrological or agricultural applications.},

Abstract = {A long term data acquisition effort of profile soil moisture is under
   way in southwestern France at 13 automated weather stations. This ground
   network was developed in order to validate remote sensing and model soil
   moisture estimates. In this paper, both those in situ observations and a
   synthetic data set covering continental France are used to test a simple
   method to retrieve root zone soil moisture from a time series of surface
   soil moisture information. A recursive exponential filter equation using
   a time constant, T, is used to compute a soil water index. The Nash and
   Sutcliff coefficient is used as a criterion to optimise the T parameter
   for each ground station and for each model pixel of the synthetic data
   set. In general, the soil water indices derived from the surface soil
   moisture observations and simulations agree well with the reference
   root-zone soil moisture. Overall, the results show the potential of the
   exponential filter equation and of its recursive formulation to derive a
   soil water index from surface soil moisture estimates. This paper
   further investigates the correlation of the time scale parameter T with
   soil properties and climate conditions. While no significant
   relationship could be determined between T and the main soil properties
   ( clay and sand fractions, bulk density and organic matter content), the
   modelled spatial variability and the observed inter-annual variability
   of T suggest that a weak climate effect may exist.},

Abstract = {The effect of Chinese Milk Vetch (CMV) residues as a cover crop on the
   performance of rice plants and nitrogen mobilization and mineralization
   in paddy soil was evaluated in a pot-culture experiment. Three
   treatments were included in the trial, i.e. without exogenous-N (Control
   or CK), urea fertilizer as the sole N-source (N) and urea plus CMV (NM).
   The results revealed higher amounts of total-N, inorganic-N, acid
   hydrolysable-N and non-acid hydrolysable-N in the soil under NM,
   followed by N and CK treatments at tillering, booting and maturity
   stages of rice. A similar trend was observed for various soil ammonia
   oxidizing bacteria, aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Correlation
   coefficients exhibited a negative correlation of residual exogenous-N-15
   with only amino acid nitrogen (P < 0.01). Moreover, low abundance of the
   key functional gene amoA in rice was found in CK treatment. From the
   results it can be concluded that the nitrogen from organic source can
   improve the availability of total-N, inorganic-N and NH4 in the soil,
   especially at the later stages of rice growth.},

Abstract = {Optimal soil moisture estimation may be characterized by
   intercomparisons among remotely sensed measurements, ground-based
   measurements, and land surface models. In this study, we compared soil
   moisture from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E),
   ground-based measurements, and a Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere Transfer
   (SVAT) model for the Soil Moisture Experiments in 2003 (SMEX03) Little

   soil moisture patterns in dry down and wetting after rainfall though it
   had modest wet biases (0.001-0.054 m(3)/m(3)) as compared to AMSR-E and
   ground data. While the AMSR-E average soil moisture agreed well with the
   other data sources, it had extremely low temporal variability,
   especially during the growing season from May to October. The comparison
   results showed that highest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean
   squared error (RMSE) were 0.054 and 0.059 m(3)/m(3) for short and long
   periods, respectively. Even if CLM and AMSR-E had complementary
   strengths, low MAE (0.018-0.054 m(3)/m(3)) and RMSE (0.023-0.059
   m(3)/m(3)) soil moisture errors for CLM and soil moisture low biases (
   0.003-0.031 m(3)/m(3)) for AMSR-E, care should be taken prior to
   employing AMSR-E retrieved soil moisture products directly for
   hydrological application due to its failure to replicate temporal
   variability. AMSR-E error characteristics identified in this study
   should be used to guide enhancement of retrieval algorithms and improve

Volume = {171},

Abstract = {Better managing crop : weed competition in cropping systems while
   reducing both nitrogen and herbicide inputs is a real challenge that
   requires a better understanding of crop and weed root architecture in
   relation to soil-nitrogen availability. An original approach was used
   which considered the parameters of a simulation model of root
   architecture as traits to analyse (a) the interspecific diversity of
   root system architecture, and (b) its response to soil-nitrogen
   availability. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted using three crop
   and nine weed species grown at two contrasted concentrations of
   soil-nitrogen availability. Plant traits were measured to characterise
   both overall plant growth and root architecture, with a focus on primary
   root emergence, root elongation and branching. The studied root traits
   varied among species (from a twofold to a fourfold factor, depending on
   the trait), validating their use as indicators to analyse the
   interspecific variability of root architecture. The largest interspecies
   differences were for two traits: ` maximal apical root diameter' and `
   interbranch distance' (distance between two successive laterals on the
   same root). Conversely, most of the studied root traits varied little
   with soil-nitrogen availability (from no variation to a 1.1-fold factor,
   depending on the trait) even though soil-nitrogen availability varied
   with a 17-fold factor and impacted the overall shoot and root biomass.
   So, the root traits used in this article are stable whatever
   soil-nitrogen availability. As they reflect processes underlying root
   system architecture, this low effect of nitrogen suggests that the rules
   governing root architecture are little affected by plant nitrogen status
   and soil-nitrogen availability. We propose that the determinants of
   differences in root system architecture between soils with contrasted
   nitrogen availability mainly originate from differences in the amount of
   carbon allocated to and within the root system. Characterising each
   plant species by a combination of root traits gave insights regarding
   the potential species competitive ability for soil resources in
   agroecosystems.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of consecutive
   crop residue incorporation and potassium (K) fertilisation on plant-soil
   K balance, K forms, K release and K fixation capacity under wheat-cotton
   rotation at Nanjing and Dafeng in China. Six treatments were evaluated:
   control (without K input), wheat straw at 0.9 t ha(-1), cotton residue
   at 0.7 t ha(-1), wheat straw and cotton residue at the aforementioned
   rates, and 150 and 300 kg ha(-1) fertiliser K. Treatments in each
   rotation year had an identical rate of nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser
   application. The initial soil K content was higher in Dafeng than
   Nanjing. In the low K content soil of Nanjing, crop K uptake with double
   crop straw was significantly higher than that under single crop straw
   return or inorganic fertiliser, and K uptake increased with increasing K
   inputs. Only double crop straw or 300 kg ha(-1) fertiliser K treatments
   reached apparent K balance in Nanjing, but not in Dafeng. The high
   negative K balance resulted from the elevated K removal by crops in
   Dafeng. Incorporation of double crop residues favoured accumulation of
   different forms of K. Application of K fertiliser tended to increase
   soil water-soluble K, and crop residue incorporation greatly improved
   non-exchangeable K at a depth of 0-20 cm. Similar to K fertiliser, crop
   residue incorporation significantly increased soil K release and
   decreased K fixation at both sites. In summary, in a 3-year field
   experiment, crop residue incorporation and inorganic K fertilisation had
   similar effects on soil K pools and balance depending on initial soil K
   level and actual K input.},

Abstract = {The development of technologies that provide rapid acidity amelioration
   of the soil profile through the surface application of amendments and
   phosphogypsum, such as no-till (NT) systems, is extremely important to
   provide adequate chemical conditions in tropical soils with low natural
   fertility, which limits the grain yield of upland rice (Oryza sativa
   L.). Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the effects of surface
   applications of lime, silicate, and phosphogypsum, applied individually
   or in mixtures, on the chemical properties of the soil profile in an NT
   system and to determine their effects on the nutrition, yield
   components; and grain yield of upland rice. The experiment was designed
   as a completely randomized block with eight treatments replicated four
   times. The combination of phosphogypsum with lime and/or silicate
   improved the surface and subsurface soil chemical properties 12 months
   following application. The mixtures increased the concentrations of K,
   Ca, Mg, N-NO3-, and S-SO42- in the subsurface layers. The sulphur
   concentration in the flag leaves of upland rice was higher with
   phosphogypsum application. The number of panicles per m(2) and grain
   yield of upland rice were positively influenced by the surface
   application of soil acidity amendments and phosphogypsum mixtures. (C)

Abstract = {Maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for the long-term
   productivity of agroecosystems. An investigation was conducted to study
   the effects of long-term application of inorganic fertilizers and
   farmyard manure (FYM) on soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content, water-stable aggregate
   distribution, and aggregate-associated carbon in a field experiment
   started in 1982 in an and region of northwest China. Application of
   inorganic fertilizer alone (N, NP, or NPK treatments) did not increase
   SOC concentrations compared with no application of fertilizers (CK) and
   SOC concentration was significantly reduced, by 18\% on average,
   compared with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment.
   Application of imbalanced inorganic fertilizer (N and NP), especially,
   resulted in a significant decrease in available phosphorus and potassium
   nutrients at a depth of 20 cm. This indicates that long-term application
   of inorganic fertilizers were inadequate to maintain levels of SOC and
   nutrients under conventional management with no aboveground crop
   residues returning to the soil. Long-term application of FYM alone or
   combined with inorganic fertilizers (M (FYM), MN, MNPK, or MNPK
   treatments), however, improved SOC and total nitrogen concentrations
   from initial values of 12.1 and 0.76 g kg(-1), respectively, to 15.46
   and 1.28 g kg(-1), on average, and also enhanced available nitrogen,
   phosphorus, and potassium concentrations by 47, 50, and 68\%,
   respectively, during the 23-year period. Treatment with FYM resulted in
   a 0.48 mm greater average mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and a
   higher percentage of macro-aggregates (> 2 mm) and small
   macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm) than treatment without FYM. The MWD
   increased with increasing SOC concentration (R-2=0.75). The SOC
   concentration was highest in small macro-aggregates, intermediate in
   macro-aggregates, and lowest in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm).
   Approximately 54-60\% of total SOC was stored in micro-aggregates
   (0.25-0.05 mm) and sand+silt fractions (< 0.05 mm) after treatment
   without FYM but 57-64\% of total SOC was stored in macro-aggregates (>
   0.25 mm) after treatment with FYM. MNPK treatment had the greatest
   effect on improving the levels of SOC and NPK nutrients and in enhancing
   the formation and stability of macro-aggregates.},

Abstract = {High rates of inorganic fertilizers are used in conventional intensive
   production systems such as Abies fraseri (fraser fir) cropping systems
   for Christmas trees. Groundcovers can be used as green mulches, help
   reduce the use of farm chemicals, and provide several environmental
   benefits. We investigated the performance of a low-input cropping system
   by combining two legume cover crops {[}Dutch white clover (Trifolium
   repens) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa)] in combination with low rates of
   inorganic fertilizers as a step toward a more sustainable production
   system. The randomized block design comprised one cover crop and one of
   three applications of reduced rate inorganic fertilizer (75\%, 50\%, and
   25\% of the recommended rate). A conventional system using herbicides
   for weed control and the 100\% rate of inorganic fertilizer was used as
   a control. Parameters measured included tree morphology, foliar nitrogen
   concentration, soil mineral nitrogen, and nitrate-N leaching below the
   root zone. A significant positive growth response (height and diameter)
   was obtained in all alfalfa-based cropping systems. This was accompanied
   by foliar nutrient concentrations similar to conventional plots and a
   reduction in nitrate-N leaching. However, in white clover-based cropping
   systems, the growth response was reduced (both height and diameter),
   suggesting competition for soil resources. In addition, the total
   nitrate-N leaching was higher in this system, suggesting an imbalance
   between mineral nitrogen availability and use in white clover-based
   cropping systems. We conclude that if the potential competition between
   cover crops and trees can be properly managed, legume cover crops can be
   effectively used to make intensive production tree-based systems more
   sustainable. Further studies related to mineralization and macronutrient
   flows are needed before any definite recommendation can be made about
   the use of these systems in large-scale production systems.},

Abstract = {A field experiment was conducted during 2003-06 on deep Vertisols of

   vermicompost and cattledung manure vis-a vis chemical fertilizers on the
   productivity, soil fertility and economics of soybean (Glycine max L.

   first year (2003-04), chemical fertilizers recorded significantly higher
   yield of crops and application of organic manures recorded 7.3 to 13.3
   \% reduction in soybean yield and 7.8 to 14.8 \% reduction in wheat
   yield. In the second year (2004-05), soybean yield was on par among the
   nutrient sources and wheat yield was on par between chemical fertilizers
   and poultry manure treatment. In the third year (2005-06), application
   of organic manures recorded similar yields to that of chemical
   fertilizers and in fact, poultry manure application resulted in 17.5 and
   3.2 \% higher yields of soybean and wheat, respectively, over the
   chemical fertilizers. The protein and oil content of soybean was not
   affected among the treatments but the protein content of wheat was lower
   in control compared to the application of either chemical or organic
   manures. At the end of the 3 cropping cycles, soil organic carbon,
   available N, P, K status and enzyme activity of soil (dehydrogenase and
   phosphatase activity) were significantly improved in organic manure
   treatments compared to chemical fertilizers. The economics of soybean -
   durum wheat cropping system was in favour of chemical fertilizers during

   better economic returns due to improved productivity and lower cost of
   cultivation compared to chemical farming.},

Title = {Predicting soil moisture distribution, dry matter, water productivity

   model application using field experimental data},

Abstract = {The use of gated pipes in surface irrigation helps to reduce water
   losses commonly associated with the use of the traditional furrows. This
   study focused on predicting soil moisture content, total dry matter,
   crop yield and water productivity of potato crop using traditional and
   modified, self-compensating gate outlet (SCGO) gated pipe using the
   SALTMED model to explore the model suitability to identify the optimum
   and economic gate spacings. The traditional gated pipes are known to
   exhibit a range of pressure head variations along the pipeline causing a
   non-uniform discharge from orifices while the modified gate pipe system,
   known as compensating gated pipes (SCGO) stabilizes the pressure heads
   and produce more uniform water discharge along the pipe line. The effect
   of three gate spacings (0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 m) was studied in a field
   experiment that has been conducted for two successive seasons, 2011-2012
   and 2012-2013. The SALTMED model has been applied and showed excellent
   agreement between the simulated and observed soil moisture, dry matter,
   yield and water productivity. Similar to the field results, the
   simulated values indicated that the modified (SCGO), with the 1.5 m gate
   spacing, gave the highest yield and water productivity. The modified
   gated pipe received less water than the traditional gated pipe, due to
   its high application efficiency. In addition to water saving, there is
   an economic benefit for using 1.5 m gate spacings as its cost is low (14
   gates per 21 m pipe length) in comparison with 1.0 m and 0.7 m spacings.
   The results confirmed SALTMED ability to simulate with high precision,
   soil moisture, dry matter, water productivity and yield for potato under
   gated pipe irrigation. Therefore, the model can be used for design
   purposes to identify the optimum and economic gate spacings without the
   need to conduct expensive, costly and labor intensive field trials. (C)

Abstract = {When soil moisture is heterogeneous, sap flow from, and ABA status of,
   different parts of the root system impact on leaf xylem ABA
   concentration ({[}X-ABA](leaf)). The robustness of a model for
   predicting {[}X-ABA](leaf) was assessed. `Two root-one shoot' grafted
   sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants received either deficit
   irrigation (DI, each root system received the same irrigation volumes)
   or partial rootzone drying (PRD, only one root system was watered and
   the other dried the soil). Irrespective of whether relative sap flow was
   assessed using sap flow sensors in vivo or by pressurization of
   de-topped roots, each root system contributed similarly to total sap
   flow during DI, while sap flow from roots in drying soil declined
   linearly with soil water potential (Psi(soil)) during PRD. Although
   Psi(soil) of the irrigated pot determined the threshold Psi(soil) at
   which sap flow from roots in drying soil decreased, the slope of this
   decrease was independent of the wet pot Psi(soil). Irrespective of
   whether sap was collected from the wet or dry root system of PRD plants,
   or a DI plant, root xylem ABA concentration increased as Psi(soil)
   declined. The model, which weighted ABA contributions of each root
   system according to the sap flow from each, almost perfectly explained
   {[}X-ABA] immediately above the graft union. That the model
   overestimated measured {[}X-ABA](leaf) may result from changes in
   {[}X-ABA] along the transport pathway or an artefact of collecting xylem
   sap from detached leaves. The implications of declining sap flow through
   partially dry roots during PRD for the control of stomatal behaviour and
   irrigation scheduling are discussed.},

Abstract = {Fertilizer application can influence soil phosphorous (P) availability
   to crops. However, information is limited on the soil P transformation
   induced by application of fertilizer P in eastern China where most soils
   are inherently low in plant available P. The objective of this study was
   to investigate the long-term effect of various combinations of composted
   pig manure, rice straw, and inorganic fertilizers on the soil P pools,
   the subsequent P uptake by crops, and potential environmental effects.
   A long-term fertilizer field trial was established on a silty clay loam
   in east China since 1996. The trial had six treatments: no fertilizer
   application, combination of inorganic fertilizers and rice straw,
   combination of inorganic fertilizers and organic manure, inorganic
   fertilizers only, rice straw only, and organic manure only. Soil samples
   (0-20 cm) were collected from each plot at the trial site in May 2013.
   Soil was analyzed for pH, organic matter, Olsen P, and Mehlich 3 P (M3
   P). Hedley's fractionation method was applied for P fractionation, and a
   soil P mass balance was evaluated.
   The accumulation of total soil P (TP), Olsen P, and M3 P was most
   pronounced (p < 0.05) when inorganic fertilizer P was applied in
   combination with manure, while the use of straw instead of manure did
   not lead to such an increase. Recovery by plant biomass as a percentage
   of applied P was greater in plots with inorganic P fertilizer than plots
   treated with manure alone. Based on the results of P fractionation,
   residual fertilizer P accumulated mostly as moderately labile and
   sparingly labile forms of P, irrespective of the type of fertilizer P
   applied. Application of organic manure apparently prevented the
   conversion of applied fertilizer P into recalcitrant P forms and
   resulted in relatively larger proportions of available P.
   From both agronomic and environmental perspectives, combined application
   of inorganic fertilizer P and organic manure is a promising agronomic
   strategy for increasing soil P availability and reducing P loss from the
   rice-wheat rotation system.},

Abstract = {The land surface soil moisture is a crucial variable in weather and
   climate models. This study presents a land data assimilation system
   (LDAS) that aims to improve the simulation of the land surface soil
   moisture and energy fluxes by merging the microwave remote sensing data
   and the general circulation model (GCM) output into a land surface model
   (LSM). This system was applied over the Tibetan Plateau, using the
   National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data as
   forcing data and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometers for EOS
   (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures as an observation. The performance of
   our four data sources, which were NCEP, AMSR-E, LDAS and simulations of
   Simple Biosphere Model 2 (SiB2), was assessed against 5 months of in
   situ measurements that were performed at two stations: Gaize and Naqu.
   For the surface soil moisture, the LDAS simulations were superior to
   both NCEP and SiB2, and there was more than a one-third reduction in the
   root mean squared errors (RMSE) for both of the stations. Compared with
   the AMSR-E soil moisture retrievals, the LDAS simulations were
   comparable at the Gaize station, and they were superior at the Naqu
   station. For the whole domain inter-comparison, the results showed that
   the LDAS simulation of the soil moisture field was more realistic than
   the NCEP and SiB2 simulations and that the LDAS could estimate land
   surface states properly even in the regions where AMSR-E failed to cover
   and/or during the periods that the satellite did not overpass. For the
   surface energy fluxes, the LDAS estimated the latent heat flux with an
   acceptable accuracy (RMSE less than 35 W/m(2)), with a one-third
   reduction in the RMSE from the SiB2. For the 5-month whole plateau
   simulation, the LDAS produced a much more reasonable Bowen Ratio than
   the NCEP, and it also generated a clear contrast of the land surface
   status over the plateau, which was wet in the southeast and dry in the
   northwest, during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Because the LDAS
   only uses globally available data sets, this study reveals the potential
   of the LDAS to improving the land surface energy and water flux
   simulations in ungauged and/or poorly gauged regions. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {On-line measurement of soil properties using the visible (Vis) and near
   infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is sensitive to soil-to-sensor distance (D)
   and angle (alpha) variations, which have prevented the successful
   development of on-line soil sensors so far. This study was undertaken to
   minimise these variations through optimising the three-point linkage of
   the tractor to improve the quality of soil spectra and the accuracy of
   plant available phosphorus (P-avl) measured with an on-line soil sensor.
   The sensor consisted of a tine, to the back of which an optical probe
   was attached to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance mode from
   the bottom of the trench opened by the tine. A mobile, fibre-type,
   Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 45 visnir fibre, Germany), with
   a measurement range of 306.5-1710.9 nm was used. Five lengths of the
   third point link (L) of the tractor of 545, 550, 555, 560 and 565 mm
   were selected to evaluate the quality of spectra collected on-line at
   0.15 m tine depth. The on-line measured spectra were corrected to remove
   the effect of D and a. The correction was evaluated by estimating the
   accuracy of predicting P-avl using on-line measured spectra and a
   previously developed P-avl calibration model.
   Results showed that the best quality of spectra measured on-line was
   obtained for L of 555 mm, at which D and alpha vanished. This finding
   was supported by the maximum value of average maximum reflectance (AMR)
   of 75.7\% obtained and by 100\% successfully collected spectra. The
   worst quality of spectra was obtained at L of 545 mm, with the largest D
   of 6 mm and the largest alpha of 0.6 degrees. Values of L of 560 and 565
   mm led to a decrease in the AMR (43.3 and 33.2\%, respectively), while
   recording 100\% successful spectra. Correction of on-line measured
   spectra led to clear improvements in the accuracy of on-line measured
   P-avl. A lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.07 mg 100 g(-1) and
   higher ratio of prediction deviations (RPD) of 1.42 were obtained with
   corrected spectra as compared to uncorrected spectra (RMSE = 1.15 and
   RPD = 1.39). In addition, the correction of spectra resulted in an
   increase in the degree of similarity between laboratory and on-line
   measured P-avl maps by 29.6\%. These results suggest the need for
   optimising the tractor hydraulic three-point linkage set up, and for
   spectra correction in order to improve the accuracy of on-line measured
   soil properties. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to evaluate non-legume cover crops for growing
   no-till grain legumes in organic farming systems. Evaluated cover crops
   should be able to suppress weed growth, reduce plant available nitrogen
   in the soil and produce large amounts of biomass with slow N
   mineralisation. Six non-legume species; spring rye (Secale cereale L.),
   black oat (Avena sativa L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), white
   mustard (Sinapis alba L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and
   hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) were tested. Plots with organic fertiliser (50
   kg N ha(-1)) and without fertiliser incorporation at three locations in
   south-east Germany were trialled and the cover crops' ability to produce
   biomass and accumulate N in plant compartments was evaluated. The N
   mineralisation from stem and leaf material was simulated using the STICS
   model. The biomass production ranged from 0.95 to 7.73 Mg ha(-1), with
   fertiliser increasing the total biomass at locations with low-N status.
   Sunflower consistently displayed large biomass and N accumulation at all
   locations and fertiliser variations, although not always significantly
   more than other species. Most N was stored in sunflower leaf material,
   which can be easily mineralised making it less suited as cover crop
   before no-till sown spring grain legumes. Rye, which produced slightly
   less biomass, but accumulated more N in the stem biomass, would be
   better suited than sunflower in this type of system. The N
   mineralisation simulation from rye biomass indicated long N
   immobilisation periods potentially improving weed suppression within
   no-till sown legume cash crops.},

Abstract = {Over centuries and even today, traditional farming practices are well
   performed without any ecological degradation. However, management
   practice such as conservative tillage combined with nutrient and residue
   could increase the crop production as well as soil fertility. A
   three-year replicated study was conducted to assess the effects of
   agronomic modification of traditional farming practices on productivity
   and sustainability of rice (wet season)-rice (dry season) system (RRS).
   The replacement of farmers practice (T-2) with conservation effective
   tillage (no-till (NT)) and integrated nutrient management (INM) practice
   along with 30\% residue retention (T-5) enhanced the straw, root and
   biomass yield of both wet season rice (WR), dry season rice (DR) and
   system as a whole over T-2. Treatment T-5 recorded significantly lower
   soil bulk density ((b)) and higher pH than the T-2 after three years of
   the experiment. Further, treatment T-5 increased total soil organic
   carbon (2.8\%), total soil organic carbon stock (2.8\%), carbon
   sequestration rate (336.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), cumulative carbon stock
   (142.9\%) and carbon retention efficiency (141.0\%) over T-2 of 0-20 cm
   depth after three year. The soil microbial biomass carbon concentration
   was significantly the highest under T-5. Similarly, the dehydrogenase
   activity was the maximum under T-5. Adoption of conservation tillage and
   nutrient management practice involving NT and INM along with residue
   retention can enhance the system productivity, and C and N sequestration
   in paddy soils is thereby contributing to the sustainability of the RRS.},

Title = {Yield and nitrogen use efficiency in wheat, and soil fertility status as
   influenced by substitution of rice with pigeon pea in a rice-wheat
   cropping system},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL AGRICULTURE},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {46},

Pages = {1185-1194},
Abstract = {Rice-wheat cropping systems managed on 10 million ha in the
   Indo-Gangetic Plain region (IGPR) of India are the most important
   production systems for national food security. Recent reports, however,
   indicate that the system is under production fatigue and the growth
   rates of rice and wheat have started declining. We, therefore, conducted
   field experiments at Modipuram, Meerut, India, for 3 consecutive years
   (1998-99 to 2000-01), to study the conservation of soil organic carbon,
   improvement in nitrogen use efficiency and increase in system yields
   through inclusion of a grain legume ( pigeon pea) in place of rice. The
   wheat yields following pigeon pea crops were significantly (P < 0.05)
   greater than those following rice crops during 1999-2000 and 2000-01,
   but not during 1998-99. The economic optimum doses of fertiliser N for
   wheat in the pigeon pea-wheat system were smaller (128-133 kg N/ha) than
   those in the rice-wheat system (139-173 kg N/ha), owing to increased N
   supply, greater N use efficiencies and a better crop growth environment
   in the pigeon pea-wheat system. The post-wheat harvest nitrate-N (NO3-N)
   at 90-105 cm soil depth in plots fertilised with 120 or 180 kg N/ha was
   greater for the rice-wheat system (6.5-8.1 mg/kg) than for the pigeon
   pea-wheat system (5.8-6.0 mg/kg), suggesting that inclusion of pigeon
   pea may help to minimise NO3-N leaching to deeper soil profile layers.
   In plots of pigeon pea, soil organic carbon at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm soil
   depths was increased at the end of the experiment compared with the
   initial organic carbon content. With continuous rice-wheat cropping, the
   bulk density of soil increased over the initial bulk density, at
   different soil profile depths in general, and at 30-45 cm soil depth in
   particular. Inclusion of pigeon pea in the system maintained soil bulk
   density at its initial level, and thus eliminated sub-surface soil
   compaction. Despite these advantages of pigeon pea over rice as a
   preceding crop to wheat, permanent substitution of rice with pigeon pea
   in rice-wheat system is unlikely, because rice is a staple foodgrain
   crop in India. Nonetheless, decline in wheat productivity owing to
   puddling-induced soil constraints that arise on continuous rice-wheat
   systems could be minimised by introduction of pigeon pea into the system
   at longer time intervals.},

Abstract = {Productivity of the rice-wheat system is critical to the food security
   of Bangladesh. However, many concerns about the sustainability of this
   system exist because of low soil organic matter (SOM). In this context,
   an experiment was performed in the agro-ecological zone of the High
   Ganges River Floodplain (HGRF) at the Regional Wheat Research Centre
   (RWRC), Rajshahi of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute
   (BARI) over two consecutive years, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. The
   experiment evaluated the productivity and changes in soil fertility of
   the wheat-rice cropping sequence as influenced by an integrated plant
   nutrition system (IPNS) and through the inclusion of legume crops. Two
   factors were considered: cropping sequence and IPNS treatment. A legume
   crop was fitted to the existing wheat-rice sequence, resulting in four
   cropping sequences: wheat-mungbean-rice, wheat-blackgram-rice,
   wheat-dhaincha-rice and wheat-fallow-rice. There were six
   fertilizer/manure treatments: 100\% recommended artificial fertilizer,
   farmers' practice (FP) and four IPNS treatments. The IPNS treatments
   comprised two rates of poultry manure (PM; 3 and 6 t ha(-1)) and cowdung
   (CD; 5 and 10 t ha(-1)). For the IPNS treatments, 100\% nutrient rates
   were adjusted with manure (PM and CD) and artificial fertilizers. The
   inclusion of legumes in the wheat-rice cropping sequence, particularly
   the use of mungbean, resulted in the highest productivity. This system
   rendered 57\% higher wheat equivalent yield (WEY) than the
   wheat-fallow-rice cropping sequence. The incorporation of legume
   residues into the soil increased SOM, total N, available P and available
   Zn, but exchangeable K and available S were depleted under all crop
   rotations. The simultaneous use of chemical fertilizer and organic
   manure (OM; PM and CD) with the IPNS approach resulted in higher crop
   productivity and system WEY as well as higher rates of OM, especially
   IPNS with 6 t ha(-1) PM. This indicates that chemical fertilizers alone
   could not provide adequate and balanced nutrition for potential yield of
   the tested crops. SOM, total N, available P and available Zn improved in
   treatments that included OM (both PM and CD) but the increment was
   greater in the combination of IPNS with higher rates of both OMs in the
   wheat-dhaincha-rice cropping sequence. K and S decreased in all nutrient
   treatments compared to initial soil. The wheat-mungbean-rice cropping
   sequence under IPNS with OM (especially 3-6 t ha(-1) PM) resulted in
   best crop productivity (wheat, 4.55; rice, 5.48; WEY of mungbean, 4.54
   and system WEY, 13.19 t ha(-1)) in both years. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Conservation tillage practices with an appropriate seed rate recover the
   declining wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and soil quality using
   conventional tillage in poorly drained silty clay soil (calcareous,
   hyperthermic and Typic Torrifluvents) in rice-wheat cropping system.
   Field experiments were conducted for 2 consecutive yr to study the
   impact of three tillage techniques {[}zero (ZT), reduced (RT) and
   conventional tillage (CT)] and four seed rates viz. 70, 100, 130 and 160
   kg ha(-1) on wheat yield, soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen in
   rice-wheat cropping system in northwestern Pakistan. Mean values for
   tillage revealed that conservation tillage (ZT and RI) resulted in
   higher spikes per m(2), biological yield, grain yield, soil organic
   matter and total soil nitrogen compared with CT. Mean values for seed
   rates displayed the highest yield and yield components at 130 kg ha(-1)
   and showed the lowest values at 70 kg ha(-1) seed rate. The results
   revealed that ZT / RT in combination with 130 kg ha(-1) seed rate
   produced higher grain yield compared with CT in the first growing
   season. In contrast, CT in combination with 130 kg ha(-1) seed rate gave
   the highest grain yield in the second growing season. The results
   emphasized the necessity of using 130 kg ha(-1) seed rate in ZT for
   improving soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen, and sustaining
   wheat yield in poorly drained silty clay soil. However, in case of
   severe infestation with weeds or insect pests, CT in combination with
   130 kg ha(-1) seed rate may be the best alternative.},

Abstract = {Pigeon pea is cultivated by most smallholder crop-livestock farmers
   mainly as a border crop. It is quite often sparsely intercropped in
   cereal-based cropping systems in the subhumid zone of Ghana. Management
   of pigeon pea and its biomass is a promising means of improving many
   abandoned arable fields but has not been consciously undertaken. The
   objective of this trial was to explore the use of pigeon pea and the
   management of its pruned biomass as part of an improved fallow for
   crop-livestock farming. Three pigeon-pea management options and a
   natural fallow (two-year fallow period) were compared in terms of maize
   grain yield and changes in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and
   cation exchange capacity. Pigeon pea grain yield ranged between 615 and
   678 kg ha(-1) and 527 and 573 kg ha(-1) in the first and second year of
   fallow, respectively. In the first year after fallow, maize gain yield
   ranged between 0.43 and 2.39 t ha(-1) and was significantly influenced
   by the fallow system. There was a marked decrease in maize grain on the
   pigeon pea fallow plots in the second year, ranging between 50 and 38.6
   per cent in Kumayili and between 42.6 and 17.6 per cent in Tingoli.
   After the two-year fallow period, increase of soil organic carbon on the
   pigeon pea fallow plot compared with the natural fallow plot was 30.5
   per cent, and there was an improvement of total nitrogen (48.5 per cent)
   and CEC (17.8 per cent). Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Abstract = {The impact of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), inorganic phosphorus
   (P), and irrigation regimes was studied in an okra (Abelmoschus
   esculentus)-pea (Pisum sativum) cropping system in an acidic Alfisol.
   Experimentation was carried out at Palampur, India, in a randomized bock
   design (RBD), replicated three times with fourteen treatments comprising
   AM fungi (Glomus mosseae), inorganic phosphorus (50, 75, and 100\%
   soil-test-based recommended P dose), irrigation regimes (at 40 and 80\%
   available water capacity), generalized recommended NPK and irrigations
   (GRD), and farmers' practice. Effects of AM fungi on plant height, leaf
   area index (LAI), and dry-matter accumulation (DMA) were nominal at
   early crop growth stage, i.e., 50 DAS (days after sowing). However, at
   100 DAS, AMF imbedded treatments led to higher plant height (4\%), LAI
   (3\%), and DMA (6\%) in okra, whereas in pea the magnitude of increase
   in these parameters following AMF inoculation was 6, 5, and 8\%,
   respectively, over non-AMF counterparts. AMF + 75\% soil-test-based P
   dose at either of these irrigation regimes gave statistically similar
   yields in both okra and pea as that obtained under 100\% soil-test-based
   P dose at either of two irrigation regimes, thus indicating an economy
   of about 25\% in soil-test-based P dose. Regarding nutrient harvest
   index in okra and pea, statistically similar values were registered with
   most nutrients under both AMF inoculated and non-AMF counterparts. In
   the case of okra, P harvest index was registered less by 3\% with AMF
   inoculation; however, its magnitude increased by 3\% in pea following
   AMF inoculation compared to non-AMF counterparts at similar levels of P
   and irrigation. At completion of two cycles of okra-pea system, AMF
   imbedded treatments did not alter available soil nutrient status
   significantly in comparison to non-AMF counterparts. Overall, current
   study suggests that practice of AMF inoculation has great potential in
   enhancing growth parameters for better productivity, fertilizer-P
   economy, and nutrient harvest efficiency in okra-pea production system
   in Himalayan acidic Alfisol.},

   indices was available potassium (K) (34\%) > available phosphorus (P)
   (32\%) > available N (13\%) > microbial biomass carbon (12\%) >
   exchangeable calcium (Ca) (9\%). The linear regression equation revealed
   the principal role of soil quality indicators in maize crop yield. The
   methodology and the results of the study could be of great relevance in
   improving and assessing soil quality not only for the study locations
   but also for other climatically and edaphically identical regions across

Abstract = {d Water is a key factor for the sustainable development of rain-fed
   apple orchards on the Loess Plateau. This study was conducted to
   investigate the spatial distribution of soil moisture and roots in the
   soil profiles of an apple orchard employing a Rainwater Collection and
   Infiltration (RWCI) system on the Loess Plateau of China. The results
   showed that: 1) There was a low soil moisture content (SMC) zone between
   depths of 40 and 80 cm and the RWCI treatment significantly increased
   SMC in these depths; 2) The RCWI system increased SMC in the 20-140 cm
   depth interval and depths greater than 140 cm when the RCWI pit depths
   were 60 cm (RWCI60) and 80 cm (RWCI80), respectively; 3) The total dry
   root density under the control (CK), RWCI60 and RWCIN treatments was
   372.12, 594.76 and 491.82 g/m3, respectively. The mass percentage root
   distributions in the 0-100, 100-200 and 200-300 cm depths were: CK
   (69.88\%, 13.74\% and 16.38\%); RWCI60 (70.35\%, 24.08\% and 5.58\%);
   and RWCI80 (46.54\%,15.04\% and 38.42\%), respectively. We found that
   root mass was concentrated close to the wetted soil depths affected by
   the RWCI treatment. The RWCI system apparently reduced drought stress
   through increased water and nutrients uptake because of increased
   subsoil SMC in the RWCI treatments. This study of the RWCI systems and
   the effects of the RCWI pit depth are important with respect to
   increasing the efficient use of rainwater, reducing drought stress and
   demonstrating the effectiveness of RWCI water saving technology in the
   rain-fed orchards in the Loess Plateau, China. (C) 2017 Published by

Title = {The effect of changing patterns in soil-moisture availability on
   grapevine root distribution, and viticultural implications for
   converting full-cover irrigation into a point-source irrigation system},
Journal = {AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF GRAPE AND WINE RESEARCH},
Year = {2007},

Abstract = {Improvements in the efficiency of water use in Australian vineyards have
   included a move away from diffuse or `total cover' irrigation techniques
   to drip irrigation systems. This change in irrigation method has a
   significant effect on moisture distribution within the soil profile,
   with implications for root growth, root-system architecture, and
   soil-water acquisition. Those issues are addressed in this paper. Our
   report is based on grapevines that had been established under a diffuse
   irrigation system (overhead sprinklers or microjets) and subsequently
   converted to drippers. Results are also presented to show the influence
   of soils with different water holding capacities on root distribution
   within a single vineyard. Variations in soil texture within a vineyard
   were found to influence the vertical distribution of roots, whereas
   irrigation history had more influence on horizontal variations in root
   density within a depth range. Conversion of vines from sprinkler
   irrigation to drippers resulted in a marked increase in total root mass
   (volume) under the drip line, particularly 25-50 cm below the surface.
   Roots were differentially influenced by irrigation history according to
   their diameter class. Under drip irrigation, the largest increase in
   root-length density occurred with roots in diameter classes between 1
   and 4 mm diameter. Grapevines established under sprinklers, and
   subsequently converted to drip irrigation, had significantly larger root
   systems (within the volume of soil sampled) than did vines maintained
   under sprinklers throughout. Therefore, vines established under
   sprinkler irrigation and then converted to drippers may be better
   equipped to cope with deficit irrigation during drought (via either RDI
   or PRD), by virtue of those additional roots.},

   double cropping system in protected condition},
Journal = {PEERJ},

Abstract = {Environmental factors greatly influence grape quality. Among them, the
   effect of within-vineyard variability of soil in relation to soil
   moisture on table grape under protected condition has rarely been
   studied. In this present research, we investigated the influence of soil
   variability, in relation with soil moisture on chlorophyll fluorescence,
   yield and quality attributes of the ``Summer Black{''} (Vitis vinifera
   L. x V. labruscana L.) table grape, popularly grown under double
   cropping system in protected covering in the southern part of China. The
   vineyard was divided vertically into three sites ( lower, middle and
   upper, 192, 202 and 212 m above sea level, respectively) and data on
   soil moisture and other yield and quality parameters were recorded.
   Among the three vineyard sites, middle site resulted in higher yield
   compared to the upper and lower sites during winter and summer cropping
   cycles. However, compared to regular summer cycle, winter cycle provided
   grapevines with higher quality attributes. Polyphasic OJIP fluorescence
   transient exhibited a considerable increase in fluorescence intensity at
   J, I and P phase in the upper and middle sites compared to the lower
   site due to variation in soil moisture in both seasons. Values of
   fluorescence parameters including minimal fluorescence, relative
   variable fluorescence at phase J and I, the maximal quantum yield of
   photosystem II were also influenced by soil moisture in different sites.
   Different sites also exhibited a significant difference in total
   phenolics, flavonoid, antioxidant activity and individual anthocyanin
   which was influenced by available soil moisture. The present study shows
   that chlorophyll fluorescence OJIP transient can be used as a sensitive
   indicator to determine the moisture stress in grape grown in a varied
   soil. Double cropping proved to be a powerful technique to improve the
   fruit quality. This result may be useful for the table grape growers to
   better utilize the vineyard soil variability with water management to
   get higher yield and quality table grape under protected condition.},

Abstract = {A deep root system may be a desirable plant characteristic in upland
   rice because it improves the plant's water extraction capacity. The
   objective of the present study was to assess the deep root development
   of rice cultivars in relation to soil moisture change and plant water
   Status under upland conditions with moderate water deficits in the field
   and in simple lysimeter experiments. We used one upland cultivar
   (Yumeno-hatamochi' {[}YHM]) and two lowland cultivars (Lemont' {[}LMT]
   and Nipponbare' {[}NPB]) in the field experiment, with no supplemental
   water front 88 to 106 days after sowing (DAS) and 116 to 145 DAS. In the
   lysimeter experiment, we used YHM and NPB and imposed two water stress
   periods during the late vegetative stages (71 to 104 DAS and 88 to 104
   DAS). In the lysimeter experiment, a higher deep-root length ratio
   (proportion of the length of deep roots to the total root length) in YHM
   was associated with a greater deep-root length than in NPB. The
   difference in deep root development was associated with change in soil
   water content at the depths of 45 to 70 cut between the two cultivars
   under the above conditions. The drought in the field experiment was less
   intense than in the lysimeter experiment, and we observed greater
   varietal differences in total aboveground biomass than in root system
   development; this was associated with the change in soil water content
   during the initial drought period. LMT, with smaller shoots, tended to
   save water and maintain higher leaf water potential and lower diffusion
   resistance as the drought progressed. Our results suggest that deep root
   development of rice was primarily advantageous for soil water extraction
   and plant water Status under moderate water stress in uplands, but that
   the advantage of a deep root system was affected by total aboveground
   biomass, which had strong effects on plant water status under these
   conditions.},

Abstract = {In Himalayan acid Alfisol, the influence of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi
   (AMF) on fruit and root characteristics in okra-pea cropping system was
   assessed at varying inorganic phosphorus and irrigation regimes (40 \&

   improved the fruit length, fruit girth and fruit weight besides
   enhancing rooting depth (13\%), root volume (7\%), root dry weight (7\%)
   and root weight density (6\%) over non-AMF treatments. In pea, AMF
   sharply increased the average pod weight (10\%), rooting depth (9\%),
   root volume (16\%), root dry weight (13\%) and root weight density
   (12\%) over non-AMF counterparts. AMF enhanced mycorrhizal root
   colonization by 2 to 2.3-fold both in okra and pea besides significant
   improvement in available soil-P pool (21\%). `AMF + 75\% soil-test based
   P dose (STB-P)' at both irrigation regimes remained statistically alike
   with generalized recommended nutrient-cum-irrigation dose (GRD) and `AMF

Abstract = {A sophisticated soil microcosm system and N-15-labeled urea were used to
   investigate nitrogen (N) use efficiency and soil N dynamics in a rice
   monoculture system in two successive seasons. Topsoil (0 cm-20 cm) and
   subsoil (20 cm-50 cm) samples were collected from a traditional double
   rice cropping field in the Jiangxi Province, China, and these soil
   samples were derived from Quaternary red clay. Treatments were randomly
   assigned with two irrigation regimes and three N application rates (no
   application control, 80\% traditional rate and 100\% traditional rate
   noted as N0, N1 and N2, respectively). The levels of N-15 recovery of
   plants, N-15 and N remaining in soil were determined. Moreover, the N
   dynamic of soil solution from different layers of the soil profile was
   surveyed. The results showed that the effects of irrigation management
   and N application rate varied in different rice growing seasons.
   Irrigation regimes had remarkable effects on grain yield and chemical
   N-15 fertilizers (CF-N-15) uptake. When compared to flood irrigation
   (FI), the shallow water depth with wetting and drying (WD) increased
   grain yield up to 5.7\%-20\%. Although the highest grain yield was
   obtained with reduced N application level, both N apparent recovery
   (NAR) and N-15 use efficiency (the percentage of plant N uptake derived
   from applied N, \%Ndfan) significantly decreased with increasing N
   inputs. However, the interaction between irrigation management and N
   application rate on grain yield and N use efficiency (NUE) of CF-N-15
   were not significant. A survey of soil solutions every 5 days indicated
   that NH (4) (+) -N was the main residual form of N, and high NH (4) (+)
   -N leaching was observed. When compared to FI, WD decreased vertical NH
   (4) (+) -N and TN leaching, especially at 10-50 cm depths of soil
   profile in the second season. NH (4) (+) -N was the main N residual form
   in the soil profile. Therefore, in this study, the WD irrigation regime
   and reduced rate (N1) was the optimal irrigation and fertilizer
   management strategy to increase the NUE of CF-N, increase the after
   effects of CF-N-15, decrease leaching loss of CF-N-15 and minimize the
   shallow groundwater pollution risk, which were all beneficial for the
   ecological environment.},

   Among all management practices, trees allowed to grow naturally (T-1 T-3
   and T-5) significantly had higher tree growth (height, dbh and crown
   diameter) as compared to pruning of tree up to 70\% plant height (T-2,
   T-3, and T-6). The grain yield of intercrops, viz blackgram {[}Vigna

   significantly less in pure crop (without tree) than agrisilviculture at
   I year age of tree but weed population and weed dry weight was
   significantly less in agrisilviculture than pure crop at 4 years age of

Abstract = {Wind erosion is a major contributor to desertification in the Sahel.
   Although three effective countermeasures for wind erosion (i.e. ridging,
   mulching with post-harvest crop residue, and windbreaks) have been
   proposed, they are not practical for Sahelian farmers. Therefore, we
   designed a new land management practice, termed the ``Fallow Band
   System,{''} which can be used for both controlling wind erosion and
   improving soil fertility and crop production. This method does not
   impose additional expense and labor requirements on Sahelian farmers who
   are economically challenged and have limited manpower. The objective of
   this study was to evaluate the effects of this system on wind-erosion
   control and soil-fertility improvement. We conducted field experiments
   at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics
   West and Central Africa and showed that (i) a fallow band can capture
   74\% of wind-blown soil particles and 58\% of wind-blown coarse organic
   matter, which suggests that it can effectively control wind erosion,
   (ii) the amount of soil nutrients available for crops in a former fallow
   band was increased by the decomposition of trapped soil materials
   containing considerable amounts of nutrients, and (iii) the amount of
   soil water available for crops in a former fallow band was increased by
   the trapped wind-blown soil materials through improvement of rainwater
   infiltration into surface soil. These results lead to the conclusion
   that the ``Fallow Band System{''} can be useful for preventing
   desertification and improving soil fertility in the Sahel, West Africa.},

Abstract = {A field experiment to study the effect of transplanting date and age of
   seedlings on growth, yield and quality of rice hybrids under SRI and
   their effect on soil fertility was conducted on sandy-clay loam soil at
   Varanasi during rainy (kharif) seasons of 2012 and 2013. The experiment
   on sandy loam soil was laid out in split-split plot design assigning
   three dates of transplanting (27 June, 7 July and 17 July) in main plot,
   two rice hybrids (PHB-71 and Pusa RH-10) in sub-plot and three age of
   seedlings (10, 14 and 18-day old) in sub-sub plot with three
   replications. Results revealed that higher growth parameters, viz. plant
   height (104.2 cm), tillers/hill (20.4), leaf area index (5.16) and dry
   matter accumulation/hill (31.2 g) and yield attributes, viz. effective
   tillers/m(2) (248.2), panicle length (30.5 cm), grains/panicle (176),
   weight/panicle (5.08 g) and test weight (23.11 g), grain and straw yield
   (6.67 and 8.71 tonnes/ha, respectively) and harvest index (43.17) were
   observed under 27 June transplanting as compared to rest of the two
   dates of planting. Protein content in grain and kernel length before and
   after cooking also registered significant improvement in 27 June
   transplanted crop. The magnitude of increase in grain and straw yield of
   hybrid under SRI by the early transplanting (27 June) as compared to the
   late transplanting (17 July) was 19.9 and 15.2 \%, respectively on
   pooled basis. However, soil pH, EC, organic carbon, available NPK,
   hulling, milling and head rice recovery percentage, kernel breadth (B)
   before and after cooking, length (L) elongation ratio and L/B ratio
   remained unaffected due to different dates of transplanting. Among the
   hybrids, PHB-71 produced markedly higher plant height (104.8 cm),
   tillers/hill (17.6), leaf-area index (4.91), dry matter
   accumulation/hill (29.5 g), effective tillers/m(2) (236.4), panicle
   length (30.1 cm), grains/panicle (188), weight/panicle (4.62 g), test
   weight (22.67 g), grain yield (7.00 tonnes/ha), straw yield (8.95
   tonnes/ha) and harvest index (43.87) over Pusa RH-10. Organic carbon
   content in soil as well as quality parameters viz. hulling, milling and
   head rice recovery percentage, protein content and kernel breadth before
   and after cooking were also recorded higher with PHB-71 than the Pusa
   RH-10. However, maximum available NPK, kernel length before and after
   cooking, length elongation and length breadth ratio before cooking were
   recorded with `Pusa RH-10'. Younger aged seedlings (10-day old) recorded
   significantly higher growth and yield parameters, yields and harvest
   index over older aged seedlings (18-day), whereas maximum available NPK
   was recorded with older aged seedlings (18-day). The 10-day old
   seedlings gave 6.4 and 12.9\% more grain yield than 14 and 18-day old
   seedlings, respectively. Interactive effect on grain yield was
   significant among date of transplanting, age of seedlings and hybrids.
   Transplanting of PHB-71 hybrid on 27 June having either 10 or 14-day old
   seedlings resulted in markedly higher grain yield as compared to rest of

Title = {Comparison and assimilation of global soil moisture retrievals from the

Abstract = {{[}1] Two data sets of satellite surface soil moisture retrievals are
   first compared and then assimilated into the NASA Catchment land surface
   model. The first satellite data set is derived from 4 years of X-band
   (10.7 GHz) passive microwave brightness temperature observations by the
   Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System
   (AMSR-E), and the second is from 9 years of C-band (6.6 GHz) brightness
   temperature observations by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave
   Radiometer (SMMR). Despite the similarity in the satellite instruments,
   the retrieved soil moisture data exhibit very large differences in their
   multiyear means and temporal variability, primarily because they are
   computed with different retrieval algorithms. The satellite retrievals
   are also compared to a soil moisture product generated by the NASA
   Catchment land surface model when driven with surface meteorological
   data derived from observations. The climatologies of both satellite data
   sets are different from those of the model products. Prior to
   assimilation of the satellite retrievals into the land model,
   satellite-model biases are removed by scaling the satellite retrievals
   into the land model's climatology through matching of the respective
   cumulative distribution functions. Validation against in situ data shows
   that for both data sets the soil moisture fields from the assimilation
   are superior to either satellite data or model data alone. A global
   analysis of the innovations ( defined as the difference between the
   observations and the corresponding model values prior to the
   assimilation update) reveals how changes in model and observations error
   parameters may enhance filter performance in future experiments.},

   Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, India. Results showed that
   average grain yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and pearl millet
   (Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Br) across the experimentation period was
   higher under integrated application of organic manures along with 150 kg
   N+30 kg P2O5/ha through chemical fertilizers as compared to application
   of recommended dose of nutrients through chemical fertilizers alone (150
   kg N+60 kg P2O5/ha). Lowest grain yield of both crops was observed when
   organic manures applied alone. Positive yield trend of both the crops
   was observed under all the nutrient management practices. The highest
   soil organic carbon (SOC) (1.14\%) was recorded with the application of
   farmyard manure (FYM) followed by pressmud and poultry manure. Build-up
   of organic carbon ranged from 0.016 to 0.037\%/year with application of
   FYM, poultry manure, pressmud as a component of integrated nutrient
   management. Highest amount of humic acid-C (HA-C) and fulvic acid-C
   (FA-C) (0.40 and 0.21\%, respectively) was observed with application of
   7.5 Mg pressmud along with 150 kg N+30 kg P2O5/ha. Integrated nutrient

Abstract = {Measurement of soil moisture is a fundamental parameter for irrigation
   scheduling. In order to determine this parameter, many types of sensors
   are employed. Some of these sensors for soil moisture measurements are
   based on electric resistivity. Measurements are affected by many factors
   including soil temperature, length of probes, amongst others, that can
   cause incorrect determination of soil moisture levels. Consequently,
   this can lead to inappropriate or unnecessary irrigation. The main
   objective of this paper is the presentation of results of several
   experiments focused on determining adequate temperature compensation for
   a simple soil moisture measurement and registration system based on
   resistivity measurements (Wenner compensation). Moreover, a comparison
   between the data obtained by this device and a reference sensor is
   included. The device was calibrated in a plot with potted vineyards
   (Vitis vinifera L. cv Bobal on 110R) under drip irrigation and
   additional conditions. Results are adequate and include a method of
   compensation of measured values based in a rolling average model of soil
   temperature with a good agreement. A simple weighed combination of box
   temperature of the device and 14cm deeper temperatures can provide a
   useful level of Wenner compensation. Additionally, this device has a
   competitive price and is adequate for water management in crops. (C)

Title = {The effect of soil salinity on the use of the universal triangle method
   to estimate saline soil moisture from Landsat data: application to the
   SMAPEx-2 and SMAPEx-3 campaigns},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {38},

Pages = {6623-6652},
Abstract = {In this article, a method based on UTM called salinity-based soil
   moisture content (S\_SMC) is developed. Since the soil moisture depends
   on the soil salinity (SS) in semi-arid regions, the S\_SMC method
   employs the SS as an effective and augmented variable in conventional
   UTM to estimate SMC in these areas. In calibration step, initially, a
   linear regression model between the land surface temperature (LST), the
   normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the SS is applied
   using in situ measurements to assess the influence of the SS in SMC
   estimation. Then, a non-linearity model is conducted through insertion
   of more terms in the linear equation and an optimal model of S\_SMC is
   yielded. Moreover, the SS is obtained using a linear model from two
   selected salinity indices derived from Landsat images and in situ
   measurements. In estimation step, the LST, NDVI, and the SS are obtained
   using Landsat data. The S\_SMC method is evaluated in the Soil Moisture
   Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx)-2 and SMAPEx-3 campaigns in wet and
   dry conditions, respectively, over two scenes of Landsat images. The
   results demonstrated that the S\_SMC method is appropriate in
   non-irrigated areas. In these areas, the S\_SMC method improves R-2
   (coefficient of determination) from 22\% to 65\% in SMAPEx-2 and from
   24\% to 50\% in SMAPEx-3. Moreover, the results have shown that the SMC
   can be estimated at satellite level with a root mean square error of
   0.06 and 0.02 (m(3) m(-3)) in wet and dry condition, respectively.
   Therefore, the SS is a key parameter to adjust conventional UTM to
   improve the SMC estimation by the S\_SMC method.},

   residue was mixed with chicken manure or rapeseed oil residue or half of
   chicken manure plus rapeseed residue or nothing was mixed for composting
   and green manuring for wheat. We also examined the residual effects of
   the fertilizers on rice. Composts of pea residue with chicken manure and
   chicken manure plus rapeseed residue enriched soil with N, P, K and
   other nutrients, and increased nutrient accumulation. Higher values were
   found for compost than for green manure but green manure with rapeseed
   residue also supplied higher residual nutrients and improved uptake and
   yield components. Rapeseed residue released nutrients slowly but chicken
   manure was efficient and stimulated the former when they were mixed. Pea
   compost with chicken manure or chicken manure plus rapeseed oil residue
   is recommended to improve soil fertility for wheat and rice.},

Abstract = {The moisture of paddy soil after rice cropping is a major impediment to
   the establishment, tillering and yield of winter wheat in the rice-wheat
   (R-W) cropping system. We examined the seedling establishment ratio,
   based on soil moisture at seeding by path analysis of nine soil/plant
   traits in the farmer's fields in Western Japan where the R-W cropping
   system was being used, to establish a strategy for improving tiller
   density by optimizing the seedling establishment ratio. The clod size of
   surface soil, which showed a significant positive correlation with soil
   moisture at seeding, had a significant negative direct effect on the
   seedling establishment ratio. The reduction in seedling establishment
   ratio, together with fewer tillers per plant, resulted in a significant
   decrease in tiller density. The stun total of contribution of soil
   moisture contents to tiller density via clod size was smaller than that
   of seeding rate, and similar to that of the amount of nitrogen (N) basal
   dressing. This indicates that manipulating clod size based on soil
   moisture at seeding provides an opportunity for maintaining tiller
   density, as well as changing the amount of N basal dressing with the
   soil moisture conditions after rice cropping.},

Abstract = {In Galician (Spain) silvopastoral systems, nutrient availability to the
   pasture and trees can be limited by soil acidity. Liming and
   fertilisation with sewage sludge could enhance the productivity of
   silvopastoral systems (including understory and trees) by increasing Ca
   and reducing Al in the soil. This study evaluated changes in soil
   chemical properties, tree growth and understory production in test
   plots, both limed and unlimed, in a silvopastoral system located on an
   acidic forest soil under Pinus radiata D. Don. This research compared
   the effects of different doses of sewage sludge (160, 320 and 480 kg
   total N ha(-1)) with the effects of mineral fertilisation (8\% N - 24\%
   P2O5 - 16\% K2O) and no fertilisation. The initial lime applications
   improved soil fertility (increasing soil pH, effective exchange
   capacity, and the saturation percentage of Ca and reducing the
   saturation percentage of Al) more than the sewage sludge. However, the
   most significant effects of sewage sludge were found over the long term
   after high doses of sewage sludge were applied (480 kg total N ha(-1)).
   Therefore, the use of sewage sludge as a fertiliser improves both soil
   fertility and the productivity of silvopastoral systems in the long term
   as long as an adequate disposal of this residue is guaranteed. (C) 2012

Abstract = {After introduction of hybrid under maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation in
   India it became competitive to rice and found suitable for crop
   diversification. Due to higher nutrient demand and differential plant
   type the hybrid needs modification in production technology especially
   for nutrient and plant geometry. So, this study was conducted in
   maize-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (MW) system in western Indo-gangetic
   plains in sandy loam soil for two consecutive years (2010-12) to explore
   best maize density and nutrient management in system in order to enhance
   soil nutrient status and productivity. The results showed that the
   application of the highest dose of nutrients in maize, i.e. 300: 45.9:
   87.5 N:P:K kg/ha resulted in higher organic carbon, macro and
   micronutrient availability in soil while application of the lowest dose
   of fertilizer gave significantly higher CEC and available sulphur.
   Significantly higher CEC, organic carbon and available nutrients were
   observed in 66 000 plants/ha which gave significantly higher plant
   height and effective tillers in wheat. The growth and yield attributes
   of wheat, viz. plant height, effective tillers, spike length,
   spikelets/spike and spike weight in wheat were significantly higher with
   residual effect of 300: 45.9: 87.5 N:P:K kg/ha nutrient application in
   maize which were on par with 250: 39.9: 75.0 N:P:K kg/ha. Amongst the
   direct nutrient application in wheat significantly higher LCC, SPAD,
   plant height, effective tillers, spike length, spikelet/spike, and grain
   weight/spike were recorded with 125\% RDF which were on par with RDF or
   75\% RDF. The better nutrition in maize compared to ad-hoc
   recommendations resulted in significant (P<0.05) enhancement of system
   productivity by 17 to 19\%. The direct application of nutrient in wheat
   gave 14 to 19 higher yield of wheat as well as 6 to 8\% higher yield of
   the MW system. So, on the basis of two years study it was concluded that
   growing of maize with 66 000 plants/ha and 250:39.9:75 kg/ha N:P:K
   application followed by 90:19.8:24.0 kg/ha N:P:K application in wheat
   may be adopted for higher yield and soil nutrient status in western

Abstract = {We studied the long-term effect of nutrient management on soil fertility
   and soil organic carbon (SOC) pools under a 6-year-old pearl
   millet-wheat cropping system in an Inceptisol of subtropical India.
   Significant build-up in soil fertility in terms of alkaline KMnO4-N,
   Olsen-P, NH4OAc-K and CaCl2-S as well as SOC pools namely, total organic
   carbon (TOC), Walkley and Black organic carbon (WBC), labile organic
   carbon (LBC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were maintained under
   FYM and integrated nutrient management involving FYM and NPK than
   unfertilized control plot in 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths. The highest
   values of TOC (11.48 g kg(-1)) and WBC (7.86 g kg(-1)) were maintained
   in FYM treated plot, while the highest values of LBC(1.36 g kg(-1)) and
   MBC (273 mg kg(-1)) were found in FYM + NPK. The magnitude of change in
   pools of SOC in sub-surface (15-30 cm) soil was low as compared to the
   surface soil (0-15 cm). Significant increase in all the pools of SOC in
   FYM treated plots indicates the importance of application of organic
   manure like FYM in maintaining organic carbon in soil. Highly strong
   relationships were exhibited between LBC and MBC with yield, indicating
   that these pools are more important for nutrient turn-over and their
   availability to plants than total SOC. Carbon management index revealed
   that integrated nutrient management could be followed for enhancing crop
   productivity, nutrient availability and soil carbon pools for long-term.
   These results conclude that for sustainable crop production and
   maintaining soil quality, input of organic manure like FYM is of major
   importance and should be advocated in the nutrient management of
   intensive cropping system for improving soil fertility and biological
   properties of soils. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {An experiment was conducted at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya,
   West Bengal, India during 2001-2003 to study the effect of levels of
   fertility and straw mulch on a rapeseed (Brassica campestris var yellow
   sarson)-greengram (Vigna radiata)-rice (Oryza sativa) cropping system
   under a rainfed upland ecosystem. The experiment was laid out in a
   split-plot design having 14 treatment combinations of organic and
   inorganic nutrients along with straw mulch in three replicates. The
   results revealed that conjunctive use of organic and inorganic nutrients
   as well as paddy straw mulch resulted higher yield in both rapeseed and
   greengram, and the residual effects of different levels of fertilization
   and mulching also gave rise to higher grain yield in the succeeding rice
   crop. The uptake of nutrients, by the cropping system as a whole, to the
   tune of 204.29 and 183.00 kg ha(-1) of N, 72.84 and 74.07 kg ha(-1) of P
   and 179.95 and 175.41 kg ha(-1) of K took place, with the treatment
   receiving 10 t ha(-1) of farmyard manure (FYM) applied (to rapeseed)
   along with 50\% recommended dose (RD) of NPK to all the crops in the
   sequence in two consecutive years, respectively. The same treatment
   resulted in a higher percentage of porosity vis-a-vis lower bulk
   density. Soil physico-chemical properties were superior in mulch-treated
   plots compared with no mulch treatment. Application of organic and
   inorganic nutrients along with proper moisture conservation practices
   can enhance the yields maintaining a good soil health.},

Abstract = {A long-term experiment was conducted at the Central Research Institute
   for Dryland Agriculture for 13 years to evaluate the effect of low
   tillage cum cheaper conjunctive nutrient management practices in terms
   of productivity, soil fertility, and nitrogen chemical pools of soil
   under sorghum-mung bean system in Alfisol soils. The results of the
   study clearly revealed that sorghum and mung bean grain yield as
   influenced by low tillage and conjunctive nutrient management practices
   varied from 764 to 1792 and 603 to 1008 kg ha(-1) with an average yield
   of 1458 and 805 kg ha(-1) over a period of 13 years, respectively. Of
   the tillage practices, conventional tillage (CT) maintained 11.0\%
   higher yields (1534 kg ha(-1)) over the minimum tillage (MT) (1382 kg
   ha(-1)) practice. Among the conjunctive nutrient management treatments,
   the application of 2 t Gliricidia loppings + 20 kg nitrogen (N) through
   urea to sorghum crop recorded significantly highest grain yield of 1712
   kg ha(-1) followed by application of 4 t compost + 20 kg N through urea
   (1650 kg ha(-1)) as well as 40 kg N through urea alone (1594 kg ha(-1)).
   Similar to sorghum, in case of mung bean also, CT exhibited a
   significant influence on mung bean grain yields (888 kg ha(-1)) which
   was 6.7\% higher compared to MT (832 kg ha(-1)). Among all the
   conjunctive nutrient management treatments, 2 t compost + 10 kg N
   through urea and 2 t compost + 1 t Gliricidia loppings performed
   significantly well and recorded similar mung bean grain yields of 960 kg
   ha(-1) followed by 1 t Gliricidia loppings + 10 kg N through urea (930
   kg ha(-1)). The soil nitrogen chemical fractions (SNCFs) were also found
   to be significantly influenced by tillage and conjunctive nutrient
   management treatments. Further, a significant correlation of SNCF with
   total soil nitrogen was observed. In the correlation study, it was also
   observed that N fraction dynamically played an important role in
   enhancing the availability pool of N in soil and significantly
   influenced the yield of sorghum grain and mung bean.},
