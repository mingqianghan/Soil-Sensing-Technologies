AB  - Agroforestry has been widely applied in the Loess Plateau of China as a means of reducing soil and water losses, restoring ecological balance, and improving both land-use efficiency and economic returns. However, agroforestry also introduces a degree of competition for soil moisture and nutrients. Walnut (Juglans regia L.)-peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) and walnut-soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) intercropping systems that have been used throughout the Loess Plateau were selected as the basis for a study of agroforestry system-its advantages and its disadvantages with respect to soil moisture, soil nutrients, root distributions, yields, and economic returns. The results showed that soil moisture and nutrient levels were affected by intercropping with walnut trees, and that the degree to which they were affected decreased as distance from the trees increased. On the other hand, intercropping with walnut trees can increase land-use efficiency by 75% and economic returns by 17%. On the basis of the study findings, we conclude that walnut-peanut and walnut-soybean intercropping can be practical and beneficial in the study region, but irrigation and fertilization methods need to be further studied and improved, root barriers should be installed at the tree-crop interface, and the distance between crops and tree rows should be adjusted to minimize competition for soil moisture and nutrients.

AB  - Soil water content is a key variable for understanding and modelling ecohydrological processes. Low-cost electromagnetic sensors are increasingly being used to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics of soil water content, despite the reduced accuracy of such sensors as compared to reference electromagnetic soil water content sensing methods such as time domain reflectometry. Here, we present an effective calibration method to improve the measurement accuracy of low-cost soil water content sensors taking the recently developed SMT100 sensor (Truebner GmbH, Neustadt, Germany) as an example. We calibrated the sensor output of more than 700 SMT100 sensors to permittivity using a standard procedure based on five reference media with a known apparent dielectric permittivity (1 < K-a < 34.8). Our results showed that a sensor-specific calibration improved the accuracy of the calibration compared to single "universal" calibration. The associated additional effort in calibrating each sensor individually is relaxed by a dedicated calibration setup that enables the calibration of large numbers of sensors in limited time while minimizing errors in the calibration process.

AB  - Lake ice depth provides important information about local and regional climate change, weather patterns, and recreational safety, as well as impacting in situ ecology and carbon cycling. However, it is challenging to measure ice depth continuously from a remote location, as existing methods are too large, expensive, and/or time-intensive. Therefore, we present a novel application that resolves size, cost, and automation issues using commercially-available soil water content reflectometer sensors from multiple manufactures. Analysis of sensors deployed in an environmental chamber using a scale model of a lake demonstrated accurate measure of the change in ice depth over any time period to within 1 cm, through sensor response of liquid-to-solid phase change. A robust correlation exists between volumetric water content in time as a function of environmental temperature and ice growth. This relationship allows us to convert volumetric water content into ice depth. An array of these sensors can be used in lake or river settings to create a temporally high-resolution ice depth record, which fills in a needed gap for ecological or climatological studies as well as increasing public recreational safety.

AB  - It is well documented that capacitance-based soil moisture sensor measurements are particularly influenced by particle size distribution, density, salinity, and temperature of a soil, in addition to its moisture content. Moreover, the equations provided by manufacturers of soil moisture sensors are often only applicable to a limited number of soil types, thus yielding significant errors when compared with gravimetric measurements for observations in real soils. This limitation makes site-specific calibrations of such sensors necessary. Consequently, development of a general equation provides the possibility to derive the needed parameters from information such as soil type or particle size distribution. This paper describes the development of a general equation for the Campbell Scientific CS616 Water Content Reflectometers using data from sensors installed throughout the Goulburn River experimental catchment. It is subsequently tested using monitoring sites in the Murrumbidgee Soil Moisture Monitoring Network, which were not part of the original development; both monitoring networks are located in south-eastern Australia. Previously developed equations for temperature correction and soil moisture estimation using the Campbell Scientific CS615 Water Content Reflectometer are adapted to the new CS616 sensor. Moreover, relationships between readily available soil properties and the parameters of the general equations are derived. It is shown that the general equations developed here can be applied to data collected in the field using only information on the soil particle size distribution with an RMSE of around 6% m(3)/m(3) (<1% m(3)/m(3) under laboratory conditions; which is a significant improvement in comparison to 14% m(3)/m(3) when using the manufacturer's equations).

AB  - This paper describes a sensor dedicated to measuring the vertical profile of the complex permittivity and the temperature of any medium in which sensor electrodes are inserted. Potential applications are the estimate of the humidity and salinity in a porous medium, such as a soil. It consists of vertically-stacked capacitors along two conductive parallel cylinders of 5 cm in diameter and at a 10-cm distance to scan a significant volume of the medium (similar to 1 L). It measures their admittances owing to a self-balanced impedance bridge operating at a frequency in the range of 1-20 MHz, possibly 30 MHz. Thanks to accurate design and electronic circuit theory-based modeling, the determination of the admittances takes into account all distortions due to lead and bridge electromagnetic effects inside the sensor when working at high frequencies. Calibration procedures and uncertainties are presented. The article also describes developments to make the present sensor autonomous on digital acquisition, basic data treatment and energy, as well as able to transfer stored data by a radio link. These steps in progress are prerequisites for a wireless network of sensors.

AB  - Recent advances in electromagnetic sensor technologies have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing devices. However, many of the available guidelines for sensor placement were empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. Sensors accuracy could be also an important factor affecting irrigation efficiency. This study investigates how soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may affect the performance of soil moisture based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems under various conditions. For this purpose several numerical experiments were carried out using a mathematical model, incorporating a system-dependent boundary condition in order to simulate soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems. The results of this study provided clear evidence that soil moisture sensors positioning and accuracy may considerably affect irrigation efficiency in soil moisture based drip irrigation scheduling systems. In specific cases the effect of soil moisture sensors positioning was as high as 16%; however, when nearby sensor positions were examined, the observed differences were generally low. The effect of sensors accuracy was even clearer. For the lower sensor's error level studied (+/- 0.01 cm(3) cm(-3)) the effect on irrigation efficiency ranged between 2.5% and 6.4%, while for the higher error level (+/- 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)) the effect ranged between 10.2% and 18.7%. These results highlight the importance of a detailed study taking into account the characteristics of specific crops, irrigation, and scheduling systems as well as soil moisture sensors in order to provide a sound basis for improved irrigation scheduling. The need for soil specific calibration of the sensors used in such systems is highlighted as well. Lastly, a significant outcome of this study is the ability of computer models to serve as efficient tools for the detailed investigation of sensors positioning and accuracy, or other automated scheduling system characteristics.

AB  - A recurrent issue in irrigation management refers to the number and optimal positioning of water content sensors in the root zone of a crop. In the field, the definition of the number and location of sensor installation is still arbitrary. How many sensors and where to install them has been studied using the Time Stable Representative Positions (TSRP) concept introduced by Soulis and Elmaloglou (2016). However, the effect of the period of the soil water content data used for the determination of the TSRP is not usually considered. The main objectives of this work are to analyze how the soil water content data collection period within an irrigation cycle affects the determined optimal sensor positioning based on TSRP; and, to evaluate if the sensors positioning affects the prediction of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) by numerical modeling. Over 60,000 soil water content data were obtained during 36 days from 12 TDR probes installed at different monitoring positions in the root zone of an irrigated banana plant. The optimal position of sensors was determined based on the concept of TSRP, considering soil water content data obtained during the entire and during the second part of the irrigation cycles. The SWAP hydrological model was also used to investigate the effect of sensors positioning in prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. It was verified that the use of soil water content data obtained at the beginning of an irrigation cycle - at times when infiltration occurs and there is a high intensity of redistribution of water in the soil - increases the uncertainties regarding the estimation of temporal stability for purposes of irrigation management. The result of the determination of the optimal positioning for sensors installation varies according to the part of the irrigation cycle from which water content measurements are considered. This variation affects the prediction of ETc by numerical modeling. As values of soil water content obtained at the beginning of the irrigation cycle increase the uncertainty of the statistical indicators and are not of practical interest for irrigation management, it is recommended that in the determination of optimal positioning of sensors, only soil water content values obtained after the infiltration and cessation of high rates of irrigation water redistribution are considered.

AB  - Soil moisture plays a critical role in land surface processes and as such there has been a recent increase in the number and resolution of satellite soil moisture observations and the development of land surface process models with ever increasing resolution. Despite these developments, validation and calibration of these products has been limited because of a lack of observations on corresponding scales. A recently developed mobile soil moisture monitoring platform, known as the "rover", offers opportunities to overcome this scale issue. This paper describes methods, results and testing of soil moisture estimates produced using rover surveys on a range of scales that are commensurate with model and satellite retrievals. Our investigation involved static cosmic-ray neutron sensors and rover surveys across both broad (36 x 36 km at 9 km resolution) and intensive (10 x 10 km at 1 km resolution) scales in a cropping district in the Mallee region of Victoria, Australia. We describe approaches for converting rover survey neutron counts to soil moisture and discuss the factors controlling soil moisture variability. We use independent gravimetric and modelled soil moisture estimates collected across both space and time to validate rover soil moisture products. Measurements revealed that temporal patterns in soil moisture were preserved through time and regression modelling approaches were utilised to produce time series of property-scale soil moisture which may also have applications in calibration and validation studies or local farm management. Intensive-scale rover surveys produced reliable soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution while broad-scale surveys produced soil moisture estimates at 9 km resolution. We conclude that the multiscale soil moisture products produced in this study are well suited to future analysis of satellite soil moisture retrievals and finer-scale soil moisture models.

AB  - During the last years there has been achieved remarkable progress in radar technology in the sense of small modules with very low radiation. Such modem radar systems offer the possibility to collect data on distance, speed and dielectric characteristics of an object in a non contact mode. Especially the numerous applicability in car industry and car safety systems leads to high performance and in conclusion to high production numbers and to low prices. In agricultural engineering these emerging technologies have to be evaluated in the sense of precision fanning.
   In detail this work deals with the measurement of density flight, a possible frequency shift and the loss in power of a radar signal. The backscattered signal is influenced by effects like spreading, attenuation, reflection and scattering. The majority of these influences is controlled by the permittivity (dielectric property) of the medium. Air and water both have extraordinary dielectric properties.
   For example, in order to measure the soil moisture one has to balance all above mentioned influences. With an appropriate set-up there is the possibility to eliminate disturbances and to come to simple relations in respect to soil moisture. But in practical measurements there are limits due to soil density, surface roughness and plants. Hints to overcome these disturbances are given.
   It is concluded, that the given working frequencies are too high to measure the soil moisture for practical irrigation. The measuring depth is too shallow. But the measurement of the surface moisture is as possible as some other interesting states. The direct control of the work to be done by the actual state of soil and crop sensed with non contact radar device during passage is the overall objective of this investigation.

AB  - Information on the accuracy of commercially available electromagnetic (EM) soil water content sensors in a variety of soil types and over a range of volumetric water content (VWC) and salinity levels is still limited. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the accuracy of the Acclima Digital Time Domain Transmissometry (TDT) and the Toro Turf Guard Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) sensors in a loamy sand and a loam soil at soil salinity levels from 2 to 18 dS m(-1). Overall linear association between gravimetric and sensor-determined VWC across all salinity levels revealed coefficients of determination between 0.86 and 0.97. In addition to a good linear model fit, a significant quadratic association was also detectable for the TDT sensor in loamy sand at 12 dS m(-1) and in loam at 12 and 18 dS m(-1). Overall, both sensors reliably measured VWC in both soil types at all salinity levels, however data suggests that different soil types require separate calibration. Moreover, accuracy of the sensor readings can be further improved if differential calibration is applied for different salinity levels. Regression analysis indicated that with increasing salinity, the Turf Guard sensors showed an upward bias (intercept for higher salinities greater than for 3 dS m(-1)), whereas the TDT sensor exhibited a downward bias (intercept smaller than for low salinitiy levels).

AB  - LAI of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and soil water content of the topsoil (200 mm) and of the subsoil (500 mm) were considered as state variables of a dynamic soil-crop system. This system was assumed to progress according to a Bayesian probabilistic state space model, in which real values of LAI and soil water content were daily introduced in order to correct the model trajectory and reach better future evolution. The chosen crop model was mini STICS which can reduce the computing and execution times while ensuring the robustness of data processing and estimation. To predict simultaneously state variables and model parameters in this non-linear environment, three techniques were used: extended Kalman filtering (EKF), particle filtering (PF), and variational filtering (VF). The significantly improved performance of the VF method when compared to EKF and PF is demonstrated. The variational filter has a low computational complexity and the convergence speed of states and parameters estimation can be adjusted independently. Detailed case studies demonstrated that the root mean square error of the three estimated states (LAI and soil water content of two soil layers) was smaller and that the convergence of all considered parameters was ensured when using VF. Assimilating measurements in a crop model allows accurate prediction of LAI and soil water content at a local scale. As these biophysical properties are key parameters in the crop-plant system characterization, the system has the potential to be used in precision farming to aid farmers and decision makers in developing strategies for site-specific management of inputs, such as fertilizers and water irrigation.

AB  - Green wall irrigation procedures are a particularly important and hard task, given that the quality of the green wall depends on them. There is currently a wide variety of irrigation programmers available, with a range of functions and prices, thereby replacing manual activities and making it easier to maintain green walls. This paper proposes the use of low-cost automated irrigation programmers via a freeware called Arduino. The system is based on air and substrate measurements to ensure optimal plant growth and high water-use efficiency. At certain thresholds, the irrigation system is activated. This not only makes irrigation more convenient but also helps to reduce energy consumption, increases irrigation efficiency and saves time. The data is then sent via Transmission Control Protocol using Internet of Things technology, in this case ThingSpeak. The platform compiles the data and presents them in simple graphical format, thus enabling real-time monitoring from wherever there is Internet access. Together with Arduino, the project incorporates the Raspberry pi system that operates like a database via Hypertext Transfer Protocol Wi-Fi received by a Structured Query Language (MySQL) server using Hypertext Preprocessor. These data are used for the subsequent analysis of green wall performance.

AB  - In this review, we have evaluated several methods and recent technologies to determine the soil nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) content to increase yield production. Sensing technology has been used for a long time to determine the exact amount of soil nutrients without going through a conventional time-consuming, and expensive laboratory testing process. Several types of sensors are developed to measure the quantity of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) present in the soil, basically known as NPK sensor that provides on-the-go detection. A significant need for compact, inexpensive, low-power, and rapid soil NPK sensors is anticipated due to the demand for enhanced agriculture production and the future widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT). This fact implies using advanced technologies for both sensing elements and rapid detection. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have also been utilized to optimize soil NPK levels. These techniques involve training models on large datasets of soil samples and their corresponding nutrient levels, allowing for accurate prediction of nutrient concentrations based on sensor data. Only the sensing devices primarily used in agriculture applications will be discussed in this review. The prominent technologies and methods used in agriculture will be explored with regard to research and development ever held in agricultural sensing devices for measuring soil parameters. These elementary methods of determining the soil parameters may be grouped into two classes: conventional and emerging. We expect this review to guide the researchers and provide an approach to the study related to producing a convenient, affordable, and efficient soil NPK detection sensor.

AB  - Soil water content sensors placement is an important factor affecting the efficiency of drip irrigation scheduling systems. The main goal of this study is to introduce the concept of time stable representative positions (TSRPs) in soil water content-based drip irrigation scheduling systems and to investigate if such positions, which can provide representative water content readings during the whole duration of the irrigation cycle, can be identified for a wide set of conditions. To this end, several numerical experiments were conducted using a custom-made mathematical model, implementing a system-dependent boundary condition in order to be able to simulate the operation of drip irrigation scheduling systems based on soil water content sensors. The results obtained indicated that sensors' representativeness considerably varies according to the sensor position, the existing conditions (e.g.,meteorological conditions or soil hydraulic properties), and the irrigation systems characteristics, however, at least one (or more) TSRP can be identified in all the examined cases. Based on the obtained results, recommendations for the optimum sensor placement are provided. Finally, numerical simulation models proved to be efficient tools for the further investigation of optimum sensors placement under various conditions in order to improve irrigation management.

AB  - The dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method is useful for measuring soil thermal properties. Measurements are made with a sensor that has two parallel cylindrical probes: one for introducing a pulse of heat into the soil (heater probe) and one for measuring change in temperature (temperature probe). We present a semianalytical solution that accounts for the finite radius and finite heat capacity of the heater and temperature probes. A closed-form expression for the Laplace transform of the solution is obtained by considering the probes to be cylindrical perfect conductors. The Laplace-domain solution is inverted numerically. For the case where both probes have the same radius and heat capacity, we show that their finite properties have equal influence on the heat-pulse signal received by the temperature probe. The finite radius of the probes causes the heat-pulse signal to arrive earlier in time. This time shift increases in magnitude as the probe radius increases. The effect of the finite heat capacity of the probes depends on the ratio of the heat capacity of the probes (C-0) and the heat capacity of the soil (C). Compared with the case where C-0/C = 1, the magnitude of the heat-pulse signal decreases (i.e., smaller change in temperature) and the maximum temperature rise occurs later when C-0/C > 1. When C-0/C < 1, the magnitude of the signal increases and the maximum temperature rise occurs earlier. The semianalytical solution is appropriate for use in DPHP applications where the ratio of probe radius (a(0)) and probe spacing (L) satisfies the condition that a(0)/L <= 0.11.

AB  - Implementation of the dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) approach for measurement of volumetric heat capacity (C) and water content (theta) with distributed temperature sensing heated fiber optic (FO) systems presents an unprecedented opportunity for environmental monitoring (e.g., simultaneous measurement at thousands of points). We applied uniform heat pulses along a FO cable and monitored the thermal response at adjacent cables. We tested the DPHP method in the laboratory using multiple FO cables at a range of spacings. The amplitude and phase shift in the heat signal with distance was found to be a function of the soil volumetric heat capacity. Estimations of C at a range of moisture contents (theta = 0.09-0.34 m(3) m(-3)) suggest the feasibility of measurement via responsiveness to the changes in q, although we observed error with decreasing soil water contents (up to 26% at theta = 0.09 m(3) m(-3)). Optimization will require further models to account for the finite radius and thermal influence of the FO cables. Although the results indicate that the method shows great promise, further study is needed to quantify the effects of soil type, cable spacing, and jacket configurations on accuracy.

AB  - Soil moisture directly affects operational hydrology, food security, ecosystem services, and the climate system. However, the adoption of soil moisture data has been slow due to inconsistent data collection, poor standardization, and typically short record duration. Soil moisture, or quantitatively volumetric soil water content (SWC), is measured using buried, in situ sensors that infer SWC from an electromagnetic response. This signal can vary considerably with local site conditions such as clay content and mineralogy, soil salinity or bulk electrical conductivity, and soil temperature; each of these can have varying impacts depending on the sensor technology.
   Furthermore, poor soil contact and sensor degradation can affect the quality of these readings over time. Unlike more traditional environmental sensors, there are no accepted standards, maintenance practices, or quality controls for SWC data. As such, SWC is a challenging measurement for many environmental monitoring networks to implement. Here, we attempt to establish a community-based standard of practice for in situ SWC sensors so that future research and applications have consistent guidance on site selection, sensor installation, data interpretation, and long-term maintenance of monitoring stations.
   The videography focuses on a multi-agency consensus of best-practices and recommendations for the installation of in situ SWC sensors. This paper presents an overview of this protocol along with the various steps essential for high-quality and long-term SWC data collection. This protocol will be of use to scientists and engineers hoping to deploy a single station or an entire network.

AB  - Ground observations are critical in the validation of soil water content (SWC) estimates from both satellites and land surface models. Portable SWC sensors provide useful information to determine the amount of SWC in the topsoil layer for various applications; however, these probes are not accurate without site-specific correction. In the present study, we examined and compared six different types of portable electromagnetic (EM) SWC sensors, including multiple sensors made by the same manufacturers, for a total of 16 EM-based SWC probes equipped with portable data loggers. All SWC probes met the target accuracy after onsite correction-the RMSD was <0.025 m(3) m(-3). Using the two-sample t tests, we observed that SWC data obtained from similar electrode lengths and from different manufacturers showed similar distributions over time with the same mean. Furthermore, using the maximize R method to combine SWC data from two different types of sensors increased the accuracy of the results. When datasets from two different types of sensors were combined, the Pearson's correlation coefficient (R value) and RMSD values were improved. The average R value improved from.930 to.945, and the RMSD decreased from 0.036 to 0.018 m(3) m(-3). These results indicate that, along with site-specific correction, synergetic use of multiple manufacturers' EM-based SWC probes can improve the R value and reduce systematic bias.

AB  - The continuous monitoring of soil water content is commonly carried out using low-frequency capacitance sensors that require a site-specific calibration to relate sensor readings to apparent dielectric bulk permittivity (Kb) and soil water content (theta). In fine-textured soils, the conversion of Kb to theta is still challenging due to temperature effects on the bound water fraction associated with clay mineral surfaces, which is disregarded in factory calibrations. Here, a multi-point calibration approach accounts for temperature effects on two soils with medium to high clay content. A calibration strategy was developed using repacked soil samples in which the Kb-theta relationship was determined for temperature (T) steps from 10 to 40 degrees C. This approach was tested using the GS3 and TEROS-12 sensors (METER Group, Inc. Pullman, WA, USA; formerly Decagon Devices). Kb is influenced by T in both soils with contrasting T-Kb relationships. The measured data were fitted using a linear function theta = aKb + b with temperature-dependent coefficients a and b. The slope, a(T), and intercept, b(T), of the loam soil were different from the ones of the clay soil. The consideration of a temperature correction resulted in low RMSE values, ranging from 0.007 to 0.033 cm3 cm-3, which were lower than the RMSE values obtained from factory calibration (0.046 to 0.11 cm3 cm-3). However, each experiment was replicated only twice using two different sensors. Sensor-to-sensor variability effects were thus ignored in this study and will be systematically investigated in a future study. Finally, the applicability of the proposed calibration method was tested at two experimental sites. The spatial-average theta from a network of GS3 sensors based on the new calibration fairly agreed with the independent area-wide theta from the Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS). This study provided a temperature-corrected calibration to increase the accuracy of commercial sensors, especially under dry conditions, at two experimental sites.

AB  - Because groundwater is a source of drinking water for many people, there is great concern to protect groundwater resources. Preferential flow through the unsaturated zone is considered one of the main contributory factors in groundwater pollution, which is influenced primarily by soil heterogeneity and management practices. To characterize the degree of preferential flow, the soil water content dynamics during short- and long-term periods in the shallow zone (0-40-cm depth) of two plots with no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) soil management practices were investigated for 2 yr using soil water sensors placed horizontally in a rectangular grid along transects across crop rows. Analysis of response times and water content changes during rainfall events confirmed the existence of short-term preferential flow at the site and that macropores and heterogeneities in soil hydraulic parameters in the shallow zone may have contributed to infiltration into the deeper layers in the NT plot. In the longer term, the pathways of infiltration and redistribution were different between the growing and non-growing seasons; however, these differences were relatively stable in both plots during the 2-yr study period.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of temperature on water content value measured by ECH2O-TE sensors. The influence of temperature on measured soil water content values was clearly demonstrated. Soil water content values measured during the day apparently oscillated with oscillating soil temperatures. Average daily temperature and soil water content were calculated for selected periods. Regression relationships between deviations of soil temperature and soil water content from their daily average values were evaluated. Correlation between the soil water content and temperature deviations increase with the soil depth due to the lower influence of rainfall and evaporation at the soil surface on measured soil water content values in deeper soil layers eg soil water content oscillation was controlled mostly by oscillating temperature. The guideline values of linear regression equations (R-2>0.8) were very similar, close to value 0.002 and the intercept values were equal to zero. The equation for recalculation of measured soil water content values at given temperature to reference soil water content for reference soil temperature, was propozed on the basis of this analysis.

AB  - Soil water content (SWC) monitoring is often used to optimize agricultural irrigation. Commonly, capacitance sensors are used for this task. However, the factory calibrations have been often criticized for their limited accuracy. The aim of this paper is to test the degree of improvement of various sensor- and soil-specific calibration options compared to factory calibrations by taking the 10HS sensor as an example. To this end, a two-step sensor calibration was carried out. In the first step, the sensor response was related to dielectric permittivity using calibration in media with well-defined permittivity. The second step involved the establishment of a site-specific relationship between permittivity and soil water content using undisturbed soil samples and time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements. Our results showed that a model, which considered the mean porosity and a fitted dielectric permittivity of the solid phase for each soil and depth, provided the best fit between bulk permittivity and SWC. Most importantly, it was found that the two-step calibration approach (RMSE: 1.03 vol.%) provided more accurate SWC estimates compared to the factory calibration (RMSE: 5.33 vol.%). Finally, we used these calibrations on data from drip-irrigated almond and apple orchards and compared the factory calibration with our two-step calibration approach.

AB  - Background To ensure further genetic gain, genomic approaches in plant breeding rely on precise phenotypic data, describing plant structure, function and performance. A more precise characterization of the environment will allow a better dealing with genotype-by-environment-by-management interactions. Therefore, space and time dependencies of the crop production processes have to be considered. The use of novel sensor technologies has drastically increased the amount and diversity of phenotypic data from agronomic field trials. Existing data management systems either do not consider space and time, are not customizable to individual needs such as field trial handling, or have restricted availability. Hence, we propose an integrative data management and information system (DMIS) for handling of traditional and novel sensor-based phenotypic, environmental and management data. The DMIS must be customizable, applicable and scalable from individual users to organizations. Results Key element of the system is a dynamic PostgreSQL database with GIS-extension, capable of importing, storing and managing all types of data including images. The database references every structural database object and measurement in a threefold approach with semantic, spatial and temporal reference. Timestamps and geo-coordinates allow automated linking of all data. Traits can be precisely defined individually or uploaded as predefined lists. Filtering and selection routines allow compilation of all data for visualization via tables, charts or maps and for export and external statistical analysis. New possibilities of environmental information-based planning of field trials, weather-guided phenotyping and data analysis for outlier or hot-spot detection are demonstrated. Conclusions The DMIS supports users in handling experimental field trials with crop plants and modern phenotyping methods. It focuses on linking all space and time dependent processes of plant production. Weather, soil and management, as well as growth and yield formation of the plants can be depicted, thus allowing a more precise interpretation of the results in relation to environment and management. Breeders, extension specialists, official testing agencies and agricultural scientists are assisted in all steps of a typical workflow with planning, designing, conducting, controlling and analyzing field trials to generate new information for decision support in the crop improvement process.

AB  - Precision agriculture is the mechanism which controls the land productivity and maximizes the revinue and minimizes the impact on sorroundings by automating the complete agriculture processes. This projected work relies on independent internet of things (IoT) enabled wireless sensor network (WSN) framework consisting of soil moisture (MC) probe, soil temperature measuring device, environmental temperature sensor, environmental humidity sensing device, CO2 sensor, daylight intensity device (light dependent resistor) to acquire real-time farm information through multi-point measurement. The projected observance technique consists of all standalone IoT-enabled WSN nodes used for timely data acquisitions and storage of agriculture information. The farm history is additionally stored for generating necessary action throughout the whole course of farming. The work summarizes the optimum usage of irrigation by the precise management of water valve using neural network-based prediction of soil water requirement in 1h ahead. Our proposed irrigation control scheme utilizes structural similarity (SSIM)-based water valve management mechanism which is used to locate farm regions having water deficiency. Moreover, a close comparative study of optimization techniques, like variable learning rate gradient descent, gradient descent for feedforward neural network-based pattern classification, is performed and the best practice is employed to forecast soil MC on hourly basis together with interpolation method for generating soil moisture content (MC) distribution map. Finally, SSIM index-based soil MC deficiency is calculated to manipulate the specified valves for maintaining uniform water requirement through the entire farm area. The valve control commands are again processed using fuzzy logic-based weather condition modeling system to manipulate control commands by considering different weather conditions.

AB  - There is a need for low-cost, high-accuracy measurement of water content in various materials. This study assesses the performance of a new microwave swept frequency domain instrument (SFI) that has promise to provide a low-cost, high-accuracy alternative to the traditional and more expensive time domain reflectometry (TDR). The technique obtains permittivity measurements of soils in the frequency domain utilizing a through transmission configuration, transmissometry, which provides a frequency domain transmissometry measurement (FDT). The measurement is comparable to time domain transmissometry (TDT) with the added advantage of also being able to separately quantify the real and imaginary portions of the complex permittivity so that the measured bulk permittivity is more accurate that the measurement TDR provides where the apparent permittivity is impacted by the signal loss, which can be significant in heavier soils. The experimental SFI was compared with a high-end 12 GHz TDR/TDT system across a range of soils at varying soil water contents and densities. As propagation delay is the fundamental measurement of interest to the well-established TDR or TDT technique; the first set of tests utilized precision propagation delay lines to test the accuracy of the SFI instrument's ability to resolve propagation delays across the expected range of delays that a soil probe would present when subjected to the expected range of soil types and soil moisture typical to an agronomic cropping system. The results of the precision-delay line testing suggests the instrument is capable of predicting propagation delays with a RMSE of +/-105 ps across the range of delays ranging from 0 to 12,000 ps with a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.998. The second phase of tests noted the rich history of TDR for prediction of soil moisture and leveraged this history by utilizing TDT measured with a high-end Hewlett Packard TDR/TDT instrument to directly benchmark the SFI instrument over a range of soil types, at varying levels of moisture. This testing protocol was developed to provide the best possible comparison between SFI to TDT than would otherwise be possible by using soil moisture as the bench mark, due to variations in soil density between soil water content levels which are known to impact the calibration between TDR's estimate of soil water content from the measured propagation delay which is converted to an apparent permittivity measurement. This experimental decision, to compare propagation delay of TDT to FDT, effectively removes the errors due to variations in packing density from the evaluation and provides a direct comparison between the SFI instrument and the time domain technique of TDT. The tests utilized three soils (a sand, an Acuff loam and an Olton clay-loam) that were packed to varying bulk densities and prepared to provide a range of water contents and electrical conductivities by which to compare the performance of the SFI technology to TDT measurements of propagation delay. For each sample tested, the SFI instrument and the TDT both performed the measurements on the exact same probe, thereby both instruments were measuring the exact same soil/soil-probe response to ensure the most accurate means to compare the SFI instrument to a high-end TDT instrument. Test results provided an estimated instrumental accuracy for the SFI of +/-0.98% of full scale, RMSE basis, for the precision delay lines and +/-1.32% when the SFI was evaluated on loam and clay loam soils, in comparison to TDT as the bench-mark.
   Results from both experimnts provide evidence that the low-cost SFI approach is a viable alternative to conventional TDR/TDT for high accuracy applications.

AB  - The complex nature of podzolic soils makes investigating their subsurface challenging. Near-surface geophysical techniques, like electromagnetic induction (EMI), offer significant assistance in studying podzolic soils. Multi-coil (MC-EMI) and multi-frequency (MF-EMI) sensors were selected to maximize soil water content (SWC) prediction in this study. The objectives were to (i) compare apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements from the MC and MF-EMI sensors under different land use conditions, (ii) investigate the spatial variation of ECa, SWC, texture, soil organic matter (SOM), and bulk density (BD) under different land use conditions, and (iii) use statistical and geostatistical analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of ECa measurements in characterizing SWC under different land use conditions, considering the texture, SOM, and BD contents. The study found that MC-EMI had statistically significant relations (p-value < 0.05) with SWC relative to the MF-EMI. Multiple linear regression (MLR) models were also shown to be more effective in representing SWC variations (higher coefficient of determination and lower root mean square error) than simple linear regression models. MC-EMI sensor provided better SWC predictions compared to the MF-EMI sensor, possibly due to larger sampling depths differences between time domain reflectometry measured SWC (SWCTDR) and MF-EMI sensor than those between SWCTDR and MC-EMI sensor. Lastly, cokriging of measured SWC was found to offer more accurate maps than cokriging of predicted SWC obtained from MLR across different land use conditions. The study has shown that EMI may not be highly effective for shallow depths, and ECa can be affected by various soil properties, making it difficult to extrapolate other parameters. However, EMI still shows promise as a reliable method for predicting SWC in boreal podzolic soils. Research into EMI's usefulness for this purpose has yielded promising results, as indicated in this study. Further investigation is needed to fully harness the potential of this promising technique.

AB  - This work reports the design, fabrication, implementation and testing of Archimedean spiral, fringing field, planar interdigital capacitive sensor employing printed circuit board technology to evaluate moisture contents in soil samples. Two sensor designs are adopted with differing numbers of turns, each in two different configurations (single sided and double sided), to evaluate their performance in the determination of moisture contents. Four different types of soil samples are subjected to experimentation in this study with either the sensors kept inserted fully into the soil samples or kept above a compacted soil surface. It is found that the sensor capacitance, in general, increases exponentially with soil moisture contents. The fitting curves are found to vary with water holding capacity of the soil. As the water holding capacity decreases, the exponential variation turns into a linear fit correspondingly. The sensor capacitance is compared with standard gravimetric method for soil moisture evaluation. It is found that the sensitivity of the present sensor is superior to all the sensors tested and reported in the past for soil moisture evaluation, with 437.48 pF/MC% for the double-sided spiral design and 229.73 pF/MC% for the single-sided design in alluvial soil. It also has other advantages like ease of implementation, high accuracy, fast response and low cost.

AB  - Soil moisture is a vital component for plant growth. There are many electro-chemical low-cost sensors that sense soil moisture with immediate effect rather than other methods such as gravimetric method and others that are expensive as well as consume lot of time. Some of these electro-chemical sensors work on resistivity whereas some sensors work on capacitance. This paper compares the efficiency of resistivity-based sensors with capacitance-based soil moisture sensors so that farmers and experts can use the better one for designing IoT-based irrigation monitoring and controller system. This comparison is performed with 21 samples having different levels of soil water content. The coefficient of variation is calculated to compare the efficiency of both the sensors. After the comparison, calibration has also been performed that depicts the soil moisture content to LCD display and alert the farmer by a buzzer.

AB  - Rain gardens are increasing in use as the shift from gray to green infrastructure continues. Water that enters a rain garden is removed by three mechanisms: overflow to an outlet, percolation to the underlying soil, and evapotranspiration (ET) to the atmosphere. Despite the importance of ET in aiding a rain garden to recover void space during the time between storm events, it is not often measured or calculated because it is so difficult to do so. This paper explores the use of soil moisture sensors to estimate ET, since they are relatively inexpensive to purchase and install. Three rain garden weighing lysimeters in Villanova, PA, were used for this study. Over a 3-yr study period daily ET was calculated each dry day and summed during the time in between storm events >25 mm. The cumulative changes of soil moisture readings during the interevent time at three depths were compared with the concurrent cumulative changes in the lysimeter weight readings. Cumulative soil moisture change was found to be strongly correlated to the cumulative ET for the different lysimeter media and drainage types. Using the two soil moisture sensors at the top and bottom of the soil column provided a similar result to using all soil moisture reading depths. The best single soil moisture reading depth was at the bottom of the lysimeter. The ET estimates via soil moisture tracking performed similar to uncalibrated potential ET estimates, but not as well as calibrated ET estimates.

AB  - Soil moisture sensors can improve water management efficiency by measuring soil volumetric water content (theta nu) in real time. Soil-specific calibration equations used to calculate theta nu can increase sensor accuracy. A laboratory study was conducted to evaluate the performance of several commercial sensors and to establish soil-specific calibration equations for different soil types. We tested five Florida sandy soils used for citrus production (Pineda, Riviera, Astatula, Candler, and Immokalee) divided into two depths (0.0-0.3 and 0.3-0.6 m). Readings were taken using twelve commercial sensors (CS650, CS616, CS655 (Campbell Scientific), GS3, 10HS, 5TE, GS1 (Meter), TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, TDR315, TDR315S, TDR135L (Acclima), and Hydra Probe (Stevens)) connected to a datalogger (CR1000X; Campbell Scientific). Known amounts of water were added incrementally to obtain a broad range of theta nu Small 450 cm(3) samples were taken to determine the gravimetric water content and calculate the theta nu used to obtain the soil-specific calibration equations. Results indicated that factory-supplied calibration equations performed well for some sensors in sandy soils, especially 5TE, TDR315L, and GS1 (R-2 = 0.92) but not for others (10HS, GS3, and Hydra Probe). Soil -specific calibrations from this study resulted in accuracy expressed as root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.018 to 0.030 m(3) m(-3) for 5TE, CS616, CS650, CS655, GS1, Hydra Probe, TDR310S, TDR315, TDR315L, and TDT-ACC-SEN-SDI, while lower accuracies were found for 10HS (0.129 m(3) m(-3)) and GS3 (0.054 m(3) m(-3)). This study provided soil -specific calibration equations to increase the accuracy of commercial soil moisture sensors to facilitate irrigation scheduling and water management in Florida sandy soils used for citrus production.

AB  - The beat pulse method enables estimation of soil thermal diffusivity (k), volumetric heat capacity (C), thermal conductivity, and water content. The heater needle and temperature-sensing needle may deflect during probe insertion into soils. The impact of needle deflection on estimates of C and k has not been fully studied theoretically or experimentally We defined theta to be the polar angle of needle deviation from the z axis and phi to be the azimuthal angle in the x-y plane. Transient-state analytical Solutions were derived for all inclined and Pulsed finite line source in a parallelepiped sample with Zero Surface temperature and adiabatic boundary conditions. For a heat Pulse sensor with 6-mm needle spacing and a heater needle of 4-cm length in a given parallelepiped (5 by 5 by 5 cm, assumed to be filled with air-dry sand), model errors in C and k were about -11.3 and 12.1%, respectively, for an inclined heater needle with theta = 1 degrees and phi = 0 degrees. Model errors in C and k were about -11.2 and 12.1% respectively, for an inclined sensor needle with theta = 1 degrees and phi = 180 degrees. When -6 <= theta <= 6 degrees for either the heater or the sensor needle, the temperature Curves could be approximated rather well by a pulsed infinite line source model with a modified probe spacing that accounted for the inclination. For various heating durations and Strengths, the errors in both k and C were relatively constant when all other parameters were fixed; however, [lie errors in both C and k decreased monotonically and slowly as k increased. The model errors in C and k were similar for four soil conditions with different thermal properties in the range -6 <= theta <= 2 degrees.

AB  - Real time soil moisture monitoring using sensors has potential to save irrigation water and improve water productivity. Field experiments were carried out for two successive years (2016-17 and 2017-18) to produce wheat crop at the Water Management Research Center, Postgraduate Agricultural Research Station, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. Field irrigation methods included flood irrigation (canvas pipe), perforated pipe irrigation, and drip irrigation under different planting geometries and irrigation designs. The sensor-based irrigation systems were developed using locally available material to minimize the cost of equipment development and energy consumption for crop irrigation. Seven wheat crop treatments used in this experiment were T-1-flood irrigation flat sowing by rabi-drill, T-2-flood irrigation bed furrow planting with 0.254 m furrow, T-3-perforated pipe irrigation bed furrow planting with 0.254 m furrow, T-4-perforated pipe irrigation bed furrow planting with 0.203 m furrow, T-5-perforated pipe irrigation bed furrow planting with 0.152 m furrow, T-6-drip irrigation flat with 0.914 m lateral spacing and T-7-drip irrigation on beds with 0.914 m lateral spacing. An IT-based web server was developed for monitoring soil moisture status to serve as decision support system for applying irrigation to the crops. The developed sensors sent soil moisture signals on cloud for data storage, reuse and sharing purpose using coding. The irrigation was applied based on soil moisture status. The system based on micro-controller was tested for irrigating wheat crop. Raspberry Pi-3 (Model B) controlled hardware in distribution box (DB) made excellent use of indigenized soil moisture sensors for calibration and irrigation water management. Type-I (Single probe) and Type-II (Double probe) steel sensors performed best due to high R-2 values of about 0.99 and RMSE in the range of 3.30% - 3.50% during calibration. The calibration further improved the accuracy of both steel and copper sensors. Since the sensors were designed, developed, and calibrated during the 1st year (2016-17) and properly installed in 2nd year (2017-18), therefore, have affected crop and soil parameters positively. Drip irrigation treatments (T-6= 359.56 mm and T-7 = 358.65 mm) required significantly lowest mean amount of water than those by all the other treatments and the flood irrigation treatments (T-1 = 431.55 mm and T-2 = 424.95 mm) required significantly greatest (alpha= 0.05) amount of mean irrigation depth. Drip irrigation treatments (T-6 and T-7) produced high mean water productivity values (14.30 and 14.20) than those under flood irrigation treatments (T-1 = 9.6 and T-2 = 10.30) and perforated pipe irrigation treatments (T-3 = 12.66, T-4 = 12.43 and T-5 = 12.30). The mean yield of wheat grain over two years was greater under drip irrigation treatments (T-6 = 5145.1 kg/ha and T-7 = 5091 kg/ha) than those under flood (T-1 = 4139 kg/ha, T-2 = 4371 kg/ha) and perforated pipe irrigation treatments (T-3 = 4969 kg/ha, T-4 = 4872 kg/ha, T-5 = 4775.7 kg/ha). Perforated pipe irrigation treatments had significantly greater (alpha = 0.5) wheat grain yield than those under flood irrigation treatments.

AB  - Agricultural producers who choose to supplement their crops' water requirement are able to determine irrigation scheduling practices better when the soil water content of their fields is known. The objective of this study was to statistically evaluate numerous sensors for their ability to accurately estimate water content in a 90-cm soil profile, based on calibrated neutron probe measurements. The sensors tested were Irrometers, Watermarks, EnviroScan, Troxler Sentry, AquaTel, AquaFlex, Trime, AquaPro, and GroPoint. The sensors were field tested at different water content levels and a variety of irrigation frequencies over a 3-year period in a Warden silt loam soil (Coarse-silty, mixed, mesic, Xerollic Camborthids) planted to alfalfa. The default factor calibration was used to estimate the soil water content from all sensors except the neutron probe, which was calibrated for the soil using the gravimetric moisture content method. The Irrometer and Watermark sensors utilized a local soil water retention relationship in order to convert soil water potential into volumetric water content. The results suggest that most sensors were able to follow the general trends successfully as soil water content changed during the growing season, and there was significant correlation between the sensors and the neutron probe readings. Although sensor trends were similar, visual and statistical analyses indicated that the actual measured values varied significantly between the sensors and the calibrated neutron probe measurements. Therefore, a soil specific calibration of each sensor would have been necessary to obtain a high degree of absolute accuracy in soil water content measurements. The results suggest that irrigators can still use uncalibrated sensors to improve their watering schedules by setting irrigation trigger points that may relate only to a specific sensor in a specific soil. These trigger points cannot easily be related to different soils, different sensors, and other sources of information such as extension fact sheets and research publications, however, because the actual water content measurements may not be correct.

AB  - High-resolution information about vertical variations in soil water content is important for applications ranging from agricultural water management to flow and transport modeling. Commonly applied tools for the investigation of vertical soil water content distribution in hydrogeological field investigations are: gravimetric laboratory analyses of soil samples, logging a cased borehole using a tool with a radioactive source (neutron probe), or yet less well established, direct push-based moisture sensor probes. Due to differences in their underlying measurement principles as well as different operation modes, each of the aforementioned methods is associated with certain advantages and limitations. A common field evaluation of these methods has not been performed until now - raising the question of how well these individual methods perform when applied under different depositional and hydrogeological conditions. For field evaluation direct push-profiling was performed at three different test sites under different hydrogeological settings and varying degree of sediment heterogeneity and compared with results obtained from gravimetric analysis of soil cores and neutron probe measurements. In direct comparison the applied direct push-based Water Content Profiler proved to be a suitable alternative to neutron probe technology for measuring the vertical water content distribution. Moreover, the Water Content Profiler proved to be advantageous over gravimetric analysis in terms vertical resolution and time efficiency. Results of this study identify application-specific limitations of the methods and thereby highlight the need for careful data evaluation, even though some of the methods described in this paper are well established.

AB  - Soil water content (theta) influences physical, chemical, and biological processes in the soil. Near-surface theta (<1-cm depth) is particularly important for surface energy partitioning, but few techniques are available for near-surface in situ theta measurements. Heat-pulse sensors can be used to determine the soil volumetric heat capacity, which is linearly related to theta. Here we describe the principles and procedures of determining near-surface in situ theta with a heat pulse sensor. The main limitations and potential errors associated with the method are also presented. When ambient soil temperature drift and the soil-air interface effects are addressed, the error in the heat-pulse-determined theta is greatly reduced. For an example, data series with theta data determined by gravimetric initial theta and heat-pulse-based change in theta (Delta theta), results agree well with gravimetric theta values, yielding a coefficient of determination of 0.95. We conclude that heat-pulse sensors are useful tools for continuously and nondestructively determining near-surface theta of non-shrink-swell soils.

AB  - This paper focuses on the development of a geophysical methodology as a tool for agricultural soil research particularly concerning the impact of different tillage. Geophysical interest laid on the suitability (practically and technically) resolution limits of the applied methods; on the reliability of the data on small horizontal and vertical scales (cm-dm) in volumetric water content (VI-VC) determination as well as consequences for the interpretation in terms of water retention capacity.
   In parts of the investigated area a large field was divided into sub-fields, each of them subjected to different tillage since about 15 years: normal tillage (field I, with a 0.3 to deep impact plough), conservative tillage (field II, zero tillage, just seeding) and mulch tillage (field III, just the uppermost 0.1 m ploughed). Measurements were performed on two parallel profiles with geoelectrics, radar, induced polarization and nuclear magnetic resonance.
   The contrast of VWC and electrical resistivity was always larger between fields I and II on profile I as well as on profile 2 but for one exception: for the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) data of August 2004 on profile 2 the largest contrast was between fields I and III, nevertheless the contrast between fields I and II was nearly as large as between fields I and III. How could the type of tillage of fields I and II be distinguished by the contrast of their physical parameters? Whereas on profile I field I was dryer and field II the wetter, on profile 2 field I was the wetter and field II the dryer one. On the other hand the laboratory samples from profile 2 showed a similar behaviour as the field data from profile I. This (apparent) contradiction may have come from the respective precipitation history. Whereas some of the measurements have been performed during and shortly after a rain event, other measurements were performed after a longer dry period. During and directly after precipitation the soil on the unploughed field II could take up more, whereas the soil on the ploughed field could not hold as much water.
   The first layer of field I was more inhomogeneous than the first layer of field II and the second layer of field I was more homogeneous than the second layer of field if. The differences in homogeneity were caused by destructive process of the plough, which loosens the soil and exposes the soil to the weathering.

AB  - The dual probe heat pulse method (DPHP) can be used to measure soil thermal properties. However, in situ probe spacing is prone to change resulting in large errors of measured soil heat capacity c. A newly designed DPHP sensor has two thermistors in the temperature probe which can be used to calculate in situ changes in probe spacing. This new sensor has been tested under the limited condition of linear coplanar probe deflection. i.e., probes were deflected in-line but were not bent in different directions. However, actual probe deflections may not always be coplanar linear. In this study the applicability of the new DPHP sensor is evaluated in fine sand and in silica sand for a variety of probe deflections. Probes are deflected at the bottom end (bottom) or top end (top) of probes. Results indicate that the new sensor can significantly eliminate errors in c caused by coplanar and non-coplanar probe deflections. Compared with bottom deflections, top deflections have larger errors in c. Thus, theory used to correct for deflections is more applicable to bottom deflections than to top deflections. The errors in c for saturated soil materials are larger than the errors in c for dry soil materials, because of the finite response times of the thermistors used in the probes. Clearly, the newly designed DPHP sensors have the potential for reducing errors caused by various kinds of probe deflections that may be encountered in the field. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Evaporation from bare soil in and and semi-arid regions is characterised by vapour transport in the upper part and liquid transport in the lower part of the soil profile. Under such conditions, both phases must be taken into account to describe the movement of water in and the evaporation from soil above a watertable. This requires location of the evaporation front, defined as the plane at which phase transformation occurs. In this study we develop a pseudo steady-state model to locate the evaporation front and then to predict the rate of evaporation under isothermal conditions. The model was tested using laboratory experiments and then developed to encompass different soil textures, salinities, watertable depths and evaporative demands. There was good agreement between the measured and simulated depths of the evaporation front and rates of evaporation. The lighter the soil texture, the deeper was the simulated evaporation front. Under salt-saturated conditions, the simulated evaporation front was deeper by a factor of 1.11, irrespective of soil type. The lower the evaporative demand, the shallower were the depth of the evaporation front and the depth of salinisation, even for deep groundwater. The depth of the evaporation front influences the rate of salinisation and the depth at which salt accumulates. It is therefore an important consideration in drainage design for irrigated systems in and and semi-arid regions where salt control is often required. However, in practice, the assumption of isothermal conditions is a simplification because the extreme temperature gradient that exists close to the soil surface leads to a more complex situation.

AB  - The goal of this study was calibration of the ECH(2)0 soil moisture sensor EC-5 and the sensor SM200 for selected soils of the Czech Republic. Based on the soil maps of the Czech Republic and various climatic conditions, five humic horizons of different soil types were selected: Stagnic Chernozem Siltic, Haplic Chernozem, Chernozem Arenic, Haplic Luvisol, and Haplic Cambisol. Soil properties (pH(KCl), pH(H2O), exchangeable acidity, cation exchange capacity, hydrolytic acidity, basic cation saturation, sorption complex saturation, oxidable organic carbon content, CaCO3 content, salinity, sand, silt, and clay content, soil particle density, bulk density) were determined using the standard laboratory techniques. Six ECH(2)0 EC-5 sensors permanently installed in six 606 cm(3) repacked soil samples of each soil were calibrated. Four calibrated SM200 sensors were inserted into the same soil samples only when measuring sensor signal. Soil water contents were determined gravimetrically. Linear equation was used to find parameters of the calibration equations relating sensor signals or evaluated dielectric constants and soil water contents. The multiple linear analyses showed that the parameters of the calibration equations for the EC-5 depended on the bulk density, fraction of sand particles, and salinity. Parameters a and b of the SM200 depended on the initial soil salinity, sand fraction and CaCO3 content, and on the sand fraction, respectively. The impact of KBr solute (concentrations of 0.01, 0.05 and 0.1M Br) on calibration equations was studied as well. It was found that ECH(2)0 EC-5 sensor measurements were more influenced by KBr solution than SM200 measurements. In the case of the ECH(2)0 EC-5 sensor, impact of KBr was lower in soils of higher initial salinity. SM200 measurements were noticeably influenced only when 0.1M Br solution was applied.

AB  - Efficient irrigation management requires a sound information basis; therefore, various environmental measurements are currently used in irrigation scheduling. Among other technics, the recent progress in electromagnetic sensors technologies promoted the development of automated irrigation scheduling systems based on soil water content sensors with very promising results in terms of water savings. However, a key factor for the adequate performance of such systems is proper placement of soil moisture sensors. Up to now, sensor placement guidelines are fragmentary or empirically determined from site and crop specific experiments. This study aims to extend the findings of previous studies investigating the issue of proper positioning of water content sensors in drip irrigation scheduling systems in uniform soils for the case of layered soils. In this context the representativeness of soil water content sensors' readings and the existence of Time Stable Representative Positions (TSRP) are investigated using a specially developed mathematical model. The use of soil water content probes that are able to monitor soil water content at various depths is also evaluated. It was found that in contrast to the previous findings concerning uniform soils, in the case of layered soils it is not possible to precisely monitor the average soil water content temporal variation in the root zone using a single sensor; however, it is feasible to achieve this using a pair of sensors. Furthermore, common optimum positions for a pair of sensors providing representative soil water content readings independently from the prevailing conditions and the irrigation system configuration can be identified. It was also found that soil water content probes covering the average rooting depth and penetrating both soil layers are also able to provide representative soil water content readings during the whole duration of the irrigation cycle. The above results represent a further step towards the development of general guidelines for sensor placement in soil water content based surface drip irrigation scheduling systems.

AB  - We present an autonomous sensor to measure soil water content that uses a single heat pulse probe based on a transistor encapsulated in a porous block. The sensor uses a bipolar junction transistor, which performs as both a heating and temperature-sensing element. Since the sensor depends on a porous block to measure the matric potential of the soil, it does not suffer from accuracy problems if the contact between the probe and the soil is not perfect. A prototype of the sensor showed a temperature variation of Delta T=2.9 degrees C when the porous ceramic was saturated with water. The sensor presented an almost linear behavior for small changes in the matric potential of a red latosol when tested in the 1-kPa and 35-kPa pressure range, showing a sensitivity of S=0.015 degrees C/kPa. The ultra-low power signal conditioning circuit can read the sensor's temperature with a resolution of approximately 0.02 degrees C, so the matric potential can be read in increments of at least 1.33 kPa. When powered only by a 2-F supercapacitor from the energy-harvesting system, the interrogation circuit is able to take one soil water content measurement per day, for eleven days.

AB  - Accurate information of soil bulk density (rho(b)) is essential for many models that predict soil water, gas, and heat transfer processes and for estimating soil carbon pools. Several indirect methods have been used to estimate rho(b) as a derivative of various soil properties. One approach is to estimate rho(b) from soil thermal conductivity (lambda) and volumetric water content (theta(w)) measured with a custom fabricated sensor (thermo-TDR). In this study, we introduce a new approach to determine rho(b) with a combination of commercially available theta(w) and thermal property sensors. Repacked samples of four differently-textured soils and a field experiment on a clay soil were used to evaluate the ability of four available sensors from METER Group, Inc. (Pullman, WA, USA) to estimate rho(b). The theta(w) was measured with the GS3 and EC-5 sensors, and soil lambda was determined with the TR-1 and SH-1 thermal property sensors. The theta(w) and lambda measurements were used to determine rho(b) inversely from a lambda-model. Compared with the GS3 sensor, the EC-5 sensor provided more accurate measurements of theta(w) for the investigated soils, and thus, the EC-5 sensor was used with the new rho(b) estimation approach. Both TR-1 and SH-1 sensors gave accurate lambda estimates when compared to modeled values. The rho(b) estimates with the TR-1/EC-5 and SH-1/EC-5 sensor combination methods agreed well with independent gravimetrically-derived rho(b) values of the repacked samples and the in-situ measurements, with average root mean square errors of 0.12 and 0.13 Mg m(-3), respectively. Thus, the commercial multi-sensor combinations can provide accurate rho(b) estimates similar to those with custom fabricated thermo-TDR sensors, and they are simpler to operate than the custom fabricated sensors.

AB  - Soil water content is an important parameter in many engineering, agricultural and environmental applications. In practice, there exists a need to measure this parameter rather frequently in both time and space. However, common measurement techniques are typically invasive, time-consuming and labour-intensive, or rely on potentially risky (although highly regulated) nuclear-based methods, making frequent measurements of soil water content impractical. Here we investigate in the laboratory the effectiveness of four new low-cost non-invasive sensors to estimate the soil water content of a range of soil types. While the results of each of the four sensors are promising, one of the sensors, herein called the "AOGAN" sensor, exhibits superior performance, as it was designed based on combining the best geometrical and electronic features of the other three sensors. The performance of the sensors is, however, influenced by the quality of the sensor-soil coupling and the soil surface roughness. Accuracy was found to be within 5% of volumetric water content, considered sufficient to enable higher spatiotemporal resolution contrast for mapping of soil water content.

AB  - Soil moisture information is a key variable for guiding in-season management decisions in rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. However, methods for deciding the number and location of soil moisture sensors (SMS) per field still remain poorly explored in the scientific literature. The goal of this study was to evaluate a quantitative framework based on soil moisture-based management zones (MZs) to determine the minimum number and tentative deployment location of SMS. Multiple spatially intensive (n > 100 observations) surveys of near-surface (0-12 cm) soil moisture were conducted during the fallow periods and early growing seasons of 2017, 2018, and 2019 on three agricultural fields using a calibrated handheld soil water reflectometer. The fuzzy C-means (FCM) clustering method was used to delineate MZs based on the soil moisture surveys, and the silhouette clustering evaluation method was used to identify the optimal number of MZs per field. Then, a sensor location index that considered the distance to the MZ boundaries and the FCM membership grade was developed to identify the tentative optimal deployment location of SMS. The proposed method effectively identified field areas with distinct soil moisture regimes and revealed the complex soil moisture spatial patterns that were not captured with elevation or soil texture alone. Dividing the fields using soil moisture-based MZ reduced the intrazone soil moisture spatial variability by about 50% compared with that of the entire field. In the three studied fields, a total of two SMS were sufficient to capture the salient soil moisture spatial regimes.

AB  - The application of time domain reflectometry (TDR) principles to determine soil water content has been widely accepted as an alternative method since Topp et al. (1980) proposed. an empirical relationship between the dielectric constant of soil and soil moisture content. However, a wide range of studies have made it clear that the proposed function has only restricted validity. Although the response of the TDR signal shows a steady correlation with soil moisture, it is also affected by others factors related to the physical and chemical nature of soil and the solute characteristics of soil solution. It is therefore necessary to determine a particular calibration for each situation. Three methods are used to calibrate a TDR sensor. First, two well-known methods are compared: noncontinuous wetting on one hand, and continuous wetting by dripping of a soil sample on the other. The third consists of the progressive introduction of a sensor in a soil sample with a known moisture content. The three methods all lead to similar consistent relationships. The methods are validated using field data taking into account spatial variation of measurement at a given date and water inputs and uptakes under an irrigated corn crop during a growing season.

AB  - Soil moisture content has always been an important parameter to control because it is a deterministic factor for site-specific irrigation, seeding, transplanting, and compaction detection. In this work, a discrete sensor that is based on a SnO2-FP (Fabry-Perot) cavity is presented and characterized in real soil conditions. As far as authors know, it is the first time that a microstructured optical fiber is used for real soil moisture measurements. Its performance is compared with a commercial capacitive soil moisture sensor in two different soil scenarios for two weeks. The optical sensor shows a great agreement with capacitive sensor's response and gravimetric measurements, as well as a fast and reversible response; moreover, the interrogation technique allows for several sensors to be potentially multiplexed, which offers the possibility of local measurements instead of volumetric: it constitutes a great tool for real soil moisture monitoring.

AB  - An effective temperature correction method for dielectric sensors is important to ensure the accuracy of soil water content (SWC) measurements of local to regional-scale soil moisture monitoring networks. These networks are extensively using highly temperature sensitive dielectric sensors due to their low cost, ease of use and less power consumption. Yet there is no general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors, instead sensor or site dependent correction algorithms are employed. Such methods become ineffective at soil moisture monitoring networks with different sensor setups and those that cover diverse climatic conditions and soil types. This study attempted to develop a general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in sensor type, climatic conditions and soil type without rainfall data. In this work an automated general temperature correction method was developed by adopting previously developed temperature correction algorithms using time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements to ThetaProbe ML2X, Stevens Hydra probe II and Decagon Devices EC-TM sensor measurements. The rainy day effects removal procedure from SWC data was automated by incorporating a statistical inference technique with temperature correction algorithms. The temperature correction method was evaluated using 34 stations from the International Soil Moisture Monitoring Network and another nine stations from a local soil moisture monitoring network in Mongolia. Soil moisture monitoring networks used in this study cover four major climates and six major soil types. Results indicated that the automated temperature correction algorithms developed in this study can eliminate temperature effects from dielectric sensor measurements successfully even without on-site rainfall data. Furthermore, it has been found that actual daily average of SWC has been changed due to temperature effects of dielectric sensors with a significant error factor comparable to 1% manufacturer's accuracy.

AB  - Plants will be an important part of future long-term space missions. Automated plant growth systems require accurate and reliable methods of monitoring soil moisture levels. There are a number of different methods to accomplish this task. This study evaluated sensors using the capacitance method (ECH20), the heat-pulse method (TMAS), and tensiometers, compared to soil water loss measured gravimetrically in a side-by-side test. The experiment monitored evaporative losses from substrate compartments filled with 1- to 2-mm baked calcinated clay media. The ECH20 data correlated well with the gravimetric measurements, but over a limited range of soil moisture. The averaged TMAS sensor data overstated soil moisture content levels. The tensiometer data appeared to track evaporative losses in the 0.5- to 2.5-kPa range of matric potential that corresponds to the water content needed to grow plants. This small range is characteristic of large particle media, and thus high-resolution tensiometers are required to distinguish changing moisture contents in this range.

AB  - The research paper introduces the development of a soil moisture sensor in accordance with the field condition and has a capacity to measure soil moisture up to 50 cm depth. In this study, the Arduino-based soil moisture sensors such as Stainless Steel 316L grade (SS316L) probe and Copper Based Probe (CBP) are introduced, which fit best with the conventional method for measuring soil moisture. The paper also presents the calibration and performance comparison of three sensors, including SS316L and CBP sensors (developed) and Manual Soil Moisture (MSM) sensors. The globally accepted and proven Oven Dry Method (ODM) is adopted for calibration purpose during soil moisture measurement. Linear, polynomial, and logarithmic regression equations, along with Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), are utilized for the best fitting. Thus, it proves that ANFIS nonlinear system gives the best result. It is observed that the SS316L sensor performs well with the desired accuracy in the given field condition compared to other soil moisture sensors. The outcome of this study will assist the government authorities, policymakers, and researchers working on water-saving objectives.

AB  - BackgroundOrganic farmers frequently report sufficient yield levels despite low or even very low soil phosphorous (P) contents questioning the applicability of widely used laboratory methods for soil P testing for organic farming.AimsThe aim of this study was to compare the validity of a broad range of different soil extraction methods on soils under organic management from South West Germany and to test the correlation of the measured soil P concentration with plant offtake.MethodsTwenty-two soil samples of eight different organic farms were extracted with different solutions: (1) water, (2) CAL, (3) Olsen, (4) Mehlich 3, (5) Bray P1, (6) Bray P2, (7) NaOH+Na2EDTA, and (8) total P. The results were then correlated with above ground plant P.ResultsSpearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) of correlations between above ground plant P and extractable soil P (Water-P, CAL-P, and Olsen-P [+active charcoal {+AC}]) determined with ICP-OES were strong (0.94, 0.90, and 0.93, respectively). Among the tested methods, above ground plant P showed a strong correlation with CAL-P as detected by ICP-OES (rs = 0.90) and colorimetry (rs = 0.91). The comparison of CAL-P data provided by farmers and CAL-P analyzed during this research showed discrepancies between the results.ConclusionsThe results of this study indicate that the CAL method can be used in organic farming despite a low extraction of organic P (Porg). Furthermore, it is recommended for farmers to take soil samples for analyses regularly and interpret changes in P in the long-term instead of interpreting individual samples.

AB  - Digitization of industrial processes using new technologies (IoT-Internet of Things, IoE-Internet of Everything), including the agriculture industry, are globally gaining growing interest. The precise management of production inputs is essential for many agricultural companies because limited or expensive sources of water and nutrients could make sustainable production difficult. For these reasons, precise data from fields, plants, and greenhouses have become more important for decision making and for the proper dosage of water and nutrients. On the market are a variety of sensors for monitoring environmental parameters within a precise agricultural area. However, the high price, data storage/transfer functionality are limiting so cost-effective products capable to transfer data directly to farmers via wireless IoT networks are required. Within a given scope, low-price sensor elements with an appropriate level of sensor response are required. In the presented paper, we have developed fully printed sensor elements and a dedicated measuring/communicating unit for IoT monitoring of soil moisture. Various fabrication printing techniques and a variety of materials were used. From the performed study, it is obvious that fully printed sensor elements based on cheap and environmentally friendly carbon layers printed on the wood substrate can compete with conventionally made sensors based on copper.

AB  - In agriculture sector, a soil moisture sensor plays a vital role in controlling the irrigation through the adequate and timely moisture of soil essential for the crop production. Owing to the chemically inert nature of zirconia, it is found to be a good material for soil moisture sensing. Therefore, the present study reports the synthesis of sol-gel based zirconia coatings and their application as efficient soil moisture sensor for water irrigation. For this purpose, zirconia was coated on 316L stainless steel substrate using zirconium propoxide precursor through sol-gel process and spin coating technique. The obtained zirconia coatings were used to fabricate and study the zirconia soil moisture sensors. Zirconia sensors were fabricated using zirconia coatings synthesized from various concentrations of zirconium precursor. The chemical structure and crystalline nature of zirconia coatings were analyzed using FTIR spectroscopy and X-ray diffractometer. Moreover, the contact angle and roughness of these coatings have been measured. It is observed that the contact angles and roughness of the synthesized zirconia coatings increased with increase in the precursor concentrations. All zirconia coatings manifested the tetragonal crystal structure. The resistance of the zirconia soil moisture sensors was measured for different moisture content in soil (%).

AB  - The ongoing transition from fossil fuels to alternative energy source provision has resulted in increased geothermal uses as Well as storage of the shallow subsurface. Existing approaches for exploration of shallow subsurface geothermal energy storage often lack the ability to provide information concerning the spatial variability of thermal storage parameters. However, parameter distributions have to be known to ensure that sustainable geothermal use of the shallow subsurface can take place especially when it is subject to intensive usage. In this paper, we test a temperature decay time approach to obtain in situ, direct, qualitative, spatial high-resolution information about the distribution of thermal storage capabilities of the shallow subsurface. To achieve this, temperature data from a high-resolution Fibre Optic-Distributed-Temperature-Sensing device, as well as data from conventional Pt-100-temperature-sensors were collected during a heat injection test. The latter test was used to measure the decay time of temperature signal dissipation of the subsurface. Signal generation was provided by in-aquifer heating with a temperature self-regulating electric heating cable. Heating was carried out for 4.5 days. After this, a cooling period of 1.5 weeks was observed. Temperature dissipation data was also compared to Direct Push-derived high-resolution (hydro-)geological data. The results show that besides hydraulic properties also the bedding and compaction state of the sediment have an impact on the thermal storage capability of the saturated subsurface. The temperature decay time approach is therefore a reliable method for obtaining information regarding the qualitative heat storage capability of heterogeneous aquifers for the use with closed loop system geothermal storage systems. Furthermore, this approach is advantageous over other commonly used methods, e.g. soil-sampling and laboratory analysis, as even small changes in (hydro-)geological properties lead to strong variances in observed heat-storage capabilities at the investigated case study site. By using fibre-optic-thermometers, nearly every requested spatial resolution can be achieved and easily be adjusted to the needs of actual test sites for shallow geothermal storage exploration.

AB  - A number of challenges must be faced when using soil moisture sensors, such as accounting for soil heterogeneity in measurements or dealing with sensor faults. As a consequence, it is difficult to obtain reliable estimations of the water status in the root zone and using sensor data for irrigation planning is not straightforward. In this work, a method is proposed to interpret soil water content measurements that is based on the use of a model to correct and complement sensor data, in particular in the case of a non-uniform water distribution. This approach relies on the decomposition of the sensor's signal in two factors, one space dependent, accounting for heterogeneity in hydraulic properties at small scales and assumed to represent porosity, and the other factor accounting for the time variation of soil water status. With practical applications in mind, a simple model and an efficient calibration procedure are developed, in particular considering the online application of the method to complement sensor data in real time. The capabilities of the model are illustrated with data from experiments on the growth of lettuce in greenhouses with reclaimed wastewater irrigation. Requiring only a short calibration period, the model is successfully validated, with a mean relative calibration error of 5.85% and a mean relative validation error of 6.8% for the soil water content data, and is proven to be a valuable tool to correct for sensor malfunctions. Moreover, the proposed method is shown to allow the meaningful estimation of the water status of the soil crop system, in particular when measurements of sensors positioned close to each other showed important differences.

AB  - The water content dynamics in the upper soil surface during evaporation is a key element in land-atmosphere exchanges. Previous experimental studies have suggested that the soil water content increases at the depth of 5 to 15 cm below the soil surface during evaporation, while the layer in the immediate vicinity of the soil surface is drying. In this study, the dynamics of water content profiles exposed to solar radiative forcing was monitored at a high temporal resolution using dielectric methods both in the presence and absence of evaporation. A 4-d comparison of reported moisture content in coarse sand in covered and uncovered buckets using a commercial dielectric-based probe (70 MHz ECH2O-5TE, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA) and the standard 1-GHztime domain reflectometry method. Both sensors reported a positive correlation between temperature and water content in the 5- to 10-cm depth, most pronounced in the morning during heating and in the afternoon during cooling. Such positive correlation might have a physical origin induced by evaporation at the surface and redistribution due to liquid water fluxes resulting from the temperature-gradient dynamics within the sand profile at those depths. Our experimental data suggest that the combined effect of surface evaporation and temperature-gradient dynamics should be considered to analyze experimental soil water profiles. Additional effects related to the frequency of operation and to protocols for temperature compensation of the dielectric sensors may also affect the probes' response during large temperature changes.

AB  - Spatially variable soil properties influence the performance of soil water content monitoring sensors. The objectives of this research were to: (i) study the spatial variability of bulk density (rho(b)), total porosity (theta(t)), clay content (CC), electrical conductivity (EC), and pH in the upper Makaha Valley watershed soils; (ii) explore the effect of variations in rho(b) and theta(t) on soil water content dynamics, and (iii) establish field calibration equations for EC-20 (Decagon Devices, Inc), ML2x (Delta-T-Devices), and SM200 (Delta-T-Devices) sensors to mitigate the effect of soil spatial variability on their performance. The studied soil properties except pH varied significantly (P < 0.05) across the soil water content monitoring depths (20 and 80 cm) and six locations. There was a linear positive and a linear inverse correlation between the soil water content at sampling and rho(b), and between the soil water content at sampling and theta(t), respectively. Values of laboratory measured actual theta(t) correlated (r = 0.75) with those estimated from the relationship theta(t) = 1 - rho(b)/rho(s), where rho(s) is the particle density. Variations in the studied soil properties affected the performance of the default equations of the three tested sensors; they showed substantial under-estimations of the actual water content. The individual and the watershed-scale field calibrations were more accurate than their corresponding default calibrations. In conclusion, the sensors used in this study need site-specific calibrations in order to mitigate the effects of varying properties of the highly weathered tropical soils.

AB  - There is increasing interest and demand for growers and researchers to use soil moisture sensors for water management and research in the state of Mississippi. Previous studies demonstrated great challenges in the selection and deployment of sensors for accurate monitoring of soil moisture due to the high variability of soil types and properties. In this study, we evaluated and calibrated three soil moisture sensors, TDR315 (Acclima), CS655 (Campbell Scientific), and GS1 (Meter Group), on-site in fields and in undisturbed soil samples in the laboratory. We selected six predominant soil types from across Mississippi, including four clayey soils (Sharkey clay loam, Brooksville silty clay, Tunica clay, and Dowling clay) and two loamy soils (Commerce sandy loam and Leeper sandy loam) for the tests. Results indicated that these three types of sensors with built-in factory calibration generally overestimated the volumetric water content (theta(v)) of the soils in both field and laboratory. The theta(v) readings of these sensors were closer to the theta(v) determined by gravimetric method in the sandy loam than in the clayey soils. The three types of sensors basically met their factory root mean squared error (RMSE) criteria in loamy soils, but they varied in their performance. The RMSE of TDR315 ranged from 0.03 to 0.17, while CS655 and GS1 had greater RMSE, ranging from 0.03 to 0.29 cm(3) cm(-3). Specific calibration of TDR315 and CS655 was conducted for each of the six soils using combinations of on-site field data and laboratory undisturbed soil data. Field validation on clay and sandy loam soils suggested that the accuracy of the soil water content measurements by CS655 and TDR315 was acceptable (R-2 > 0.6) with proper in situ and undisturbed soil-specific calibration.

AB  - Tillage causes changes to soil structure, and if the soil is too wet when tillage is performed, the change to the soil structure will be detrimental. A methodology that could be used for estimating the maximum gravimetric soil water content for optimum tillage would be helpful to prevent soil structural damage. The objective of this study was to compare five methods for estimating the soil water content for tillage. These methods utilized existing data of water retention, Atterberg limits, and Proctor compaction tests. The database included 80 soils, 51 from Germany and 29 from north central USA. Additionally, on three sites in Germany, soil water content in the field was measured intensively and related to the estimates of soil water content for workability. Maximum soil water content for optimum tillage of cohesive soils was at a consistency index of 1.15 and 90% of the water content at the lower plastic limit. For both cohesive and non-cohesive soils, the maximum soil water content for optimum workability was equal to either the water content at maximum Proctor density or 70% of the water content at a tension of -5 kPa. At the water content of the inflection point of the water retention curve, in many cases the soil would be too wet for tillage. The results provide methods for estimation of the maximum water content for optimum tillage from databases with existing soil physical properties. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Practices to improve the efficient use of water are of high relevance in rainfed agriculture. The effect of cropping systems on soil available water and water use of crops grown in a humid and temperate climate was investigated. This study was conducted at the University of Minnesota Southwest Research and Outreach Center near Lamberton, Minnesota, during three growing seasons. The treatments studied included an extended 4-year crop rotation (oat/alfalfa-alfalfa-cornsoybean) using organic inputs or high external (mineral) inputs and the traditional 2-year corn-soybean rotation, with a prairie as the control treatment. Response variables included crop yield, soil moisture monitored at 0.10, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, 1.00, and 2.00 m depths, root length density, and crop water use. We found that alfalfa depleted more water than the other crops, including the prairie. Regardless of the extent of the rotation and the type of input, the soil water depletion and crop water use followed the same pattern: alfalfa > corn > oat/alfalfa > soybean. For conditions in the humid and temperate climate of southwest Minnesota, the average water use of crops was 652 mm for alfalfa, 535 mm for corn, 340 mm for oat/alfalfa, and 484 mm for soybean. The average water use of the prairie was 604 mm.

AB  - BackgroundFarmers need information regarding soil fertility at every location of their fields to attain a higher level of precision in nutrient management. Nonetheless, the acquisition and processing of soil samples are labor-intensive and time-utilizing, and the related cost remains high-priced to farmers. Artificial intelligence is the most speedily growing area combined into approximately all aspects of human life. Soil macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), and potassium (K) have a significant role in precision agriculture. There is a huge need for powerful and rapid measurement systems to measure accurately the macronutrients in the soil for optimal crop productivity, especially in site-specific crop management system, where the application of fertilizer can be regulated spatially with respect to crop demand. Nevertheless, it can present a research direction to design an advanced scheme in order to predict the properties of soil. A portable sensor device is a basic need of an agriculture system for the accurate and rapid monitoring of soil macronutrients.AimIn this research, the soil nutrients identified from the collected soil samples using optical sensors are evaluated for their accuracy using a deep learning approach.MethodsA deep residual network is exploited for the soil nutrient prediction after augmenting the gathered soil data. Finally, various performance evaluation measures, like mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE), are calculated to detect how accurately the sensor predicted the soil nutrients.ResultsFrom the experimental analysis, it is stated that the proposed model attained low MSE value of 4.59 e-09, the low RMSE value of 6.78 e-05, and the low MAE value of 4.66 e-05 for N prediction. Likewise, the proposed model attained the least MSE value of 1.41 e-05, the least RMSE value of 0.0003, and the least MAE value of 0.0001 for P prediction.ConclusionFinally, for K prediction, the proposed model achieved the least MSE value of 1.54 e-06, least RMSE value of 1.24 e-03, and the least MAE value of 1.38 e-05.

AB  - Artificial intelligence is a quickly expanding field incorporated into nearly every human life aspect. There is an enormous requirement for influential and speedy measurement systems to calculate precise macronutrients in soil, wherein fertiliser application can be spatially regulated concerning crop demand. However, there is a need to develop a potential avenue for research to design a highly developed model to forecast soil properties. For precise and speedy monitoring of soil macronutrients, a portable sensor device is an essential requirement of an agriculture system. Thus, soil nutrients recognised from gathered soil samples by optical sensors are estimated for their accuracy by the deep learning approach in this work. The deep long short-term memory (LSTM) model is utilised for prediction of soil nutrients following augmenting collected soil data. From investigational analysis, it is revealed that deep LSTM model gained least MSE value of 9.106 e(-06), least RMSE value of 0.00301, low MAE value of 0.0008 and low MAPE value of 0.0017.

AB  - Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors have been widely used in many fields for measurement of soil water content. However, few TDR sensors have been used in a hyper-arid environment (e.g. less than 0.05 m(3) m(-3)), and such sensor applicability is not yet confirmed. In this study we examine theta - t and theta - epsilon(bulk) relations and temperature dependency for natural sand and glass beads in a laboratory using commercially available TDR sensors. As a result, this study clarifies that TDR sensors are applicable even in a hyper-arid environment when calibration was properly made. We also focus on a specific range of soil water content, which leads to a highly precise calibration equation. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Principles and frequency of soil water content (SWC) measurements used in the transient water flow experiments may cause distinction on the determination of soil hydraulic properties (SHP) by inverse modelling (IM). Consequently, use of agro-hydrological models and irrigation management can be affected. This work has the following objectives: (i) to analyze if the type of sensor and the frequency of SWC measurement used in the transient water flow experiments for IM affect the results regarding SHP; (ii) to assess if variations on the SWC measurement frequencies affect the results of SHP to the point of causing effects on the agro-hydrological modelling through SWAP model and on the passion fruit irrigation management based on soil water sensing; (iii) point out strategies for the correct irrigation management based on SHP obtained by IM. The results regarding SHP were applied to the modelling of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and SWC with the use of SWAP agro-hydrological model. The type of sensor and the frequency of SWC data measurements interfered in the results regarding SHP obtained by IM, with implications on the agro-hydrological modelling and on the irrigation management through soil water sensing (SWS). The results of this study alert for the differences that may occur in SWC values when those are obtained from matric potential through soil water retention curves. This is specially important for higher and lower critical matric potentials used as reference for the moment to turn on and off a irrigation. When using GS1 sensors for IM, it is recommended to use intervals of SWC data measurement of 1 h, as the TDR sensors performed better with SWC data acquisition frequency between 1 and 12 h. Finally, it is understood that the factors that affect agro-hydrological modeling and the performance of the type of soil water sensor are diverse and integrated in a complex nonlinear way, for instance: atmospheric condition, soil texture and structure, topography, presence/absence of plants, soil and irrigation management practices. Thus, similar studies should be carried out considering variations in these factors so that a generalist and integrated conclusion is possible.

AB  - Soil water flow models are based on simplified assumptions about the mechanisms, processes, and parameters of water retention and flow. That causes errors in soil water flow model predictions. Data assimilation (DA) with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) corrects modeling results based on measured state variables, information on uncertainty in measurement results and uncertainty in modeling results. The objectives of this work were (i) to evaluate pedotransfer functions (PTFs) as a source of data to generate an ensemble of Richards' equation-based models for the EnKF application to the assimilation of soil water content data and (ii) to research how effective assimilation of soil moisture sensor data can be in correcting simulated soil water content profiles in field soil. Data from a field experiment were used in which 60 two-rod time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes were installed in a loamy soil at five depths to monitor the soil water content. The ensemble of models was developed with six PTFs for water retention and four PTFs for the saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-sat). Measurements at all five depths and at one or two depths were assimilated. Accounting for the temporal stability of water contents substantially decreased the estimated noise in data. Applicability of the Richards' equation was confirmed by the satisfactory calibration results. In absence of calibration and data assimilation, simulations developed a strong bias caused by the overestimation of K-sat from PTFs. Assimilating measurements from a single depth of 15 cm or of 35 cm provided substantial improvements at all other observation depths. An increase in data assimilation frequency improved model performance between the assimilation times. Overall, bringing together developments in pedotransfer functions, temporal stability of soil water patterns, and soil water content sensors can create a new source of data to improve modeling results in soil hydrology and related fields.

AB  - Nowadays, the estimation of volumetric soil water content (theta) through apparent dielectric permittivity (epsilon(a)) is the most widely used method. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the high iron content of two sandy loam soils on estimating their water content using two dielectric sensors. These sensors are the WET sensor operating at 20 MHz and the ML2 sensor operating at 100 MHz. Experiments on specific soil columns, in the laboratory, by mixing different amounts of water in the soils to obtain a range of theta values under constant temperature conditions were conducted. Analysis of the results showed that both sensors, based on manufacturer calibration, led to overestimation of theta. This overestimation is due to the high measured values of epsilon(a) by both sensors used. The WET sensor, operating at a lower frequency and being strongly affected by soil characteristics, showed the greatest overestimation. The difference of epsilon(a) values between the two sensors ranged from 14 to 19 units at the maximum actual soil water content (theta(m)). Compared to the Topp equation, the WET sensor measures 2.3 to 2.8 fold higher value of epsilon(a). From the results, it was shown that the relationship theta(m)-epsilon(0.5)(a) remained linear even in the case of these soils with high iron content and the multi-point calibration (CALALL) is a good option where individual calibration is needed.

AB  - This paper proposes an integrated method for the estimation of soil moisture in potato crops that uses a low-cost wireless sensor network (WSN). Soil moisture estimation maps were created by applying the Kriging technique over a WSN composed of 11 x 11 nodes. Our goal is to estimate the soil moisture of the crop with a small-scale WSN. Using a perfect mesh approach on a potato crop, experimental results demonstrated that 25 WSN nodes were optimal and sufficient for soil moisture characterization, achieving estimations errors < 2%. We provide a strategy to select the number of nodes to use in a WSN, to characterize the moisture behavior for spatio-temporal analysis of soil moisture in the crop. Finally, the implementation cost of this strategy is shown, considering the number of nodes and the corresponding margin of error.

AB  - Current estimates of Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE) at regional and continental scales contain significant uncertainty. It has been shown that root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) content has a first-order effect on NEE. The objective of the NASA Airborne Microwave Observatory of Subcanopy and Subsurface (AirMOSS) project is to provide measurements to estimate RZSM using a P-band airborne radar. Flight operations are conducted over representative sites of the nine major North American biomes which have been instrumented with soil water content sensors in various locations and over various depth layers which will be correlated to the P-band radar return signal. The hypothesis of the AirMOSS project is that integrating spatially and temporally resolved observations of RZSM into ecosystem dynamics models can significantly reduce the uncertainty of NEE estimates and carbon balance estimates. The calibration of the sensor systems is described and results are demonstrated for multiday up to annual time series at various sites. The success of fitting four models (e.g., power, first-, second-, and third-order polynomials) to the RZSM content with depth is tested by using in situ data collected in Tonzi Ranch, CA, USA, in 2014. Under the testing condition, all models satisfy the mission goal most of the duration. The second-and third-order models perform better during the dry season than the simpler power and first-order models. However, during periods of rapidly changing values of RZSM content, none of the models are able to meet the root-mean-squared error objective.

AB  - Unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) is a measurement of soil water-retaining ability in unsaturated soil. The unsaturated hydraulic properties are necessary to predict the movement of water in unsaturated soil. The current study aims to create an alternative experimental device to estimate the K using soil moisture sensors. The experimental set up was designed and fabricated in order to measure the volumetric water content using GS3 (Campbell) sensors at different heights. The data obtained from the sensors was validated using mass of moist sand column measured from electronic balance. The K was estimated with the help of retention and conductivity functions. The primary materials used in the study were solute-free water and sand. It was found that the reading from the sensors was in good match with the reading of the volumetric water content calculated from the mass of water in the sand column with a root mean square error of 0.0091. Soil water retention curve and hydraulic conductivity were plotted using Peters-Durner-Iden (PDI) model. The results were compared to the van Genuchten function. The K prediction was initially equivalent for both models, but the later overpredicts the falling rate of hydraulic conductivity with the increasing soil matric suction before underpredict after 200 cm matric suction on a sandy soil. PDI function was able to extrapolate the hydraulic conductivity film flow region of sandy soil.

AB  - Indigenized soil moisture sensors can be viable tools to improve water productivity through precision irrigation application. This study was conducted at Water Management Research Center, Postgraduate Agricultural Research Station, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. Three types of soil moisture sensors were designed and fabricated using copper, brass, and steel. These sensors comprised a bottom tapered tip, middle tube/rod, and top handling part (packing foam). The length of the sensors was 30.48 cm, with bottom tip tapered at 33 degrees over the length of 14.22 mm. The working principle was based on soil dielectric property through +ve electrode at the top and -ve electrode at bottom tip of the sensor tube. Type-I sensor had one probe, Type-II had two probes and Type-III had two insulated probes of galvanized steel. The electric current (mA) measured in response to the soil moisture status in the root zone was converted into digital form using microcontroller. These sensors were tested and calibrated against Gravimetric Method. The evaluation of Type-I, II, and III sensors showed that MBE (Mean Bias Error) was found to be within the acceptable limit of 2.5%, whereas RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) was lesser than 5% only in case of steel sensors and was out of the limit for all other sensors. The cost incurred on the indigenized sensors manufacturing was 10 times lesser than that of the imported. These research findings indicate that indigenized soil moisture sensors made of steel is relatively more accurate and can monitor real time soil moisture for promoting precision irrigation to improve water productivity.

AB  - Subirrigation can reduce water loss and nutrient runoff from greenhouses, because used nutrient solution is collected and recirculated. Capacitance moisture sensors can monitor substrate volumetric water content (theta) and control subirrigation based on minimum theta thresholds, providing an alternative to timers. Our objectives were to automate an ebb-and-flow, subirrigation system using capacitance moisture sensors, monitor moisture dynamics within the containers, and determine the effect of five theta thresholds (0.10, 0.18, 0.26, 0.34, or 0.42 m(3).m(-3)) on hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella Welw. ex hem.) 'Panama Red' (PP20,121) growth. Subirrigation was monitored using capacitance sensors connected to a multiplexer and a data logger and controlled using a relay driver connected to submersible pumps. As the substrate theta dropped below the thresholds, irrigation was turned on for 3 min followed by 3-min drainage. Capacitance sensors effectively controlled subirrigation by irrigating only when substrate theta dropped below the thresholds. Each irrigation cycle resulted in a rapid increase in substrate theta, from 0.10 to approximate to 0.33 m(3).m(-3) with the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) irrigation threshold vs. an increase in theta from 0.42 to 0.49 m(3).m(-3) with the 0.42-m(3).m(-1) irrigation threshold. Less nutrient solution was used in the lower theta threshold treatments, indicating that sensor control can reduce water and thus fertilizer use in subirrigation systems. The water dynamics showed that the bottom part of the pots was saturated after irrigation with theta decreasing quickly after an irrigation event, presumably because of drainage. However, the water movement among substrate layers was slow with the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) irrigation threshold with water reaching the upper layer 5.5 to 20 h after irrigation. The 0.10-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold resulted in 81% fewer irrigations and 70% less nutrient solution use compared with the 0.42-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold. However, the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold also reduced hibiscus shoot height by 30%, shoot dry weight 74%, and compactness by 63% compared with the 0.42-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold. Our results indicate that soil moisture sensors can be used to control subirrigation based on plant water use and substrate water and to manipulate plant growth, thus providing a tool to improve control over plant quality in subirrigation systems.

AB  - Vegetable production areas are intensively managed with high inputs of fertilizer and irrigation. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the interaction between N-fertilizer rates and irrigation scheduling using soil moisture sensor irrigation controllers (SMS) on yield, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of bell pepper cultivated under plastic mulch and drip irrigation. Treatments included three irrigation scheduling and three N-rates (176, 220, and 330 kg/ha). Irrigation treatments were: SS10, water application controlled by SMS-based irrigation set at 10% volumetric water content (VWC) which was allotted five irrigation windows daily and bypassed events if the soil VWC exceeded the established threshold; SS12, threshold set at 12% VWC; and TIME, control with irrigation being applied once a day similar to grower irrigation management. Marketable yields ranged between 16 and 29 Mg/ha. The SMS treatments reduced the applied irrigation in 7 to 62% compared to TIME treatment without reducing yield. The treatments SS10 and SS12 reduced nitrate leaching by 25 to 73% compared to TIME treatment.

AB  - Accurate measurements of soil moisture content can contribute to resource conservation in irrigated systems. The objective of this study was to evaluate various soil moisture sensors (a porous cup tensiometer, Diviner 2000, PR2, XH300, PM100, and ML3; the mention of model names does not constitute an implied endorsement) used in four different soil types. The experiment was conducted inside a greenhouse using a specially constructed box that contained the soil samples. The soil samples were first saturated and subsequently drained before starting the measurements. The soil moisture content was determined by the oven-drying method. Using the standard deviation of the sensor readings, regression analyses were performed, resulting in calibration equations and coefficient of determination (R-2) values for each sensor and soil type combination. The porous cup tensiometer, Diviner 2000, PR2, and ML3 measurements resulted in excellent R-2 values that exceeded 0.95 for the four soils. However, measurements with the XH300 and PM100 sensors resulted in R-2 values of 0.37 to 0.86 and 0.61 to 0.94, respectively, limiting their scientific applicability for the studied soils. Therefore, the porous cup tensiometer, Diviner 2000, PR2, and ML3 estimated the soil moisture content with greater confidence than did the other sensors and with an error of less than 5%.

AB  - An increasing number of electromagnetic (EM) sensors are deployed to measure volumetric soil water content (0) for agricultural, ecological, and geotechnical applications. While impedance and capacitance sensors generally operate at frequencies between 20-300 MHz, time domain-reflectometry (TDR) and-transmissometry (TDT) function in the GHz range. In general, lower frequency sensors are less expensive but more sensitive to confounding effects of salinity, temperature, and soil textural variations. To simplify sensor application, factory-supplied calibrations are often provided for different porous media types such as mineral, organic, and saline soils, or soilless-substrates. The objective of the presented study was to evaluate the performance of eight commercially available EM moisture sensing systems (TDR 100, CS616, Theta Probe, Hydra Probe, SM300, Wet2, 5TE, 10HS) in seven well-characterized and texturally varying soils using a standardized approach. The validity of factory supplied-calibration relationships was evaluated and the influence of soil properties on the EM responses for 0 measurements was observed. Results indicate that the factory-supplied calibration relationships for groups of mineral and organic soils in general performed well, but some inconsistences were identified and suggestions for improvement are discussed. Soil-specific calibrations from this study yielded accuracies of around 0.015 m(3)m(-3) for 10HS, SM300, and Theta Probe, while lower accuracies of about 0.025 m(3) m(-3) were found for TDR100, CS616, Wet2, 5TE, and the Hydra Probe. These results are based on mineral soils having a large variation in texture, electrical conductivities below 2 dS m(-1), organic matter below 10%, and specific surface areas of less than 50 m(2) g(-1).

AB  - Field capacity is a frequently used concept in irrigation systems and agriculture. Although there is some debate on how field capacity is defined, it is generally accepted as being the upper limit on the available water that is stored in a soil profile that can be held against the pull of gravity. Standard methods for determining field capacity require waiting two days before measuring volumetric water content after raising the water content above field capacity. This is time-consuming and subject to natural water inputs during the monitoring period. The contribution of this work is a method for rapidly estimating field capacity in situ using volumetric water sensors, a specific irrigation schedule, and a nonlinear curve fitting model that predicts field capacity using a drainage model. The result allows for determining field capacity rapidly with very good accuracy and can be used with automatic irrigation systems in landscaping and agriculture.

AB  - Li, Y., Liu, S., Liao, Z. and and He, C. 2012. Comparison of two methods for estimation of soil water content from measured reflectance. Can. J. Soil Sci. 92: 845-857. Remote sensing (RS) technology has increasingly been used in soil water content estimation, but highly accurate estimates of soil water content are still difficult to obtain using this technique. This study aims to determine the wavelengths at which the reflectance is most sensitive to changes in soil water contents (theta). Four types of soils were selected and light reflectance (lambda) was measured at different theta. Results showed that parabolic functions fit theta with measured lambda very well but only for individual wavelengths. Multivariate linear functions of theta with measured lambda at visually selected characteristic wavelengths led to improved predictions, but the coefficients of determination between the soil water content and measured reflectance (R-2 ranged from 0.788 to 0.925 for the four soils) were still not high for the studied soils. Stepwise multiple linear regressions between theta and measured lambda showed higher coefficients of determination (R-2 increased to 0.99 when the number of the statistically selected wavelengths increased) than the multiple regression, but had lower coefficients of determination than the stepwise multiple linear regressions between theta and the normalized band depths (D-n). The multi-variable linear functions fitted the measured theta vs. D-n best with much higher R-2 values, even when a single wavelength was used. Re-sampling wavelengths of less than 20 nm preserved the main features of the original reflectance for the studied soils. Parameters were fitted for the quadratic functions using the re-sampled reflectance data at 20-nm wavelength intervals for further estimation of soil water content, which was considered potentially applicable in RS technology for estimating soil water content provided that soils are relatively homogeneous. In conclusion, stepwise multiple linear regression functions between theta vs. D-n are statistically precise and are recommended for estimating soil water content from reflectance. Parameters for quadratic functions relating soil water content to the observed reflectance could be potentially used in RS technology for estimating soil water content.

AB  - Interreplicate variability-the spread in output values among units of the same sensor subjected to essentially the same condition-can be a major source of uncertainty in sensor data. To investigate the interreplicate variability among eight electromagnetic soil moisture sensors through a field study, eight units of TDR315, CS616, CS655, HydraProbe2, EC5, 5TE, and Teros12 were installed at a depth of 0.30 m within 3 m of each other, whereas three units of AquaSpy Vector Probe were installed within 3 m of each other. The magnitude of interreplicate variability in volumetric water content (theta(v)) was generally similar between a static period near field capacity and a dynamic period of 85 consecutive days in the growing season. However, a wider range of variability was observed during the dynamic period primarily because interreplicate variability in theta(v) increased sharply whenever infiltrated rainfall reached the sensor depth. Interreplicate variability for most sensors was thus smaller if comparing theta(v) changes over several days that excluded this phenomenon than if comparing theta(v) directly. Among the sensors that also reported temperature and/or apparent electrical conductivity, the sensors exhibiting the largest interreplicate variability in these outputs were characterized by units with consistently above or below average readings. Although manufacturers may continue to improve the technology in and the quality control of soil moisture sensors, users would still benefit from paying greater attention to interreplicate variability and adopting strategies to mitigate the consequences of interreplicate variability.

AB  - The spatial distribution of soil pH, electrical conductivity, available nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium concentrations at Anaimalai block of Coimbatore district, India was interpolated by geostatistical analysis to create digital maps of soil NPK that renders numerous information for agro based policy making. 1627 soil samples in 30,700 acres were gathered by composite soil sampling method and rendered interpolation analysis to predict the soil parameters at unsampled locations. Based on geostatistical, deterministic and interpolation with barriers methods 13 interpolation models were generated and compared to validate the precision. Interpolation reveals the deficiency of soil available nitrogen and phosphorus whereas available potassium was in sufficient range. Radial basis function, inverse distance weighting, probability kriging, empirical Bayesian kriging and local polynomial interpolations were validated by linear correlation method that reveals the precisions of models with R-2 values of 0.74, 0.82, 0.98, 0.89 and 0.79 (soil pH, EC, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium respectively).

AB  - Surface layer soil water content is important for evaporation, surface energy balance, seed germination, residue decomposition, microbial activity, and many other biological, chemical, and physical processes. The standard method (i.e., the gravimetric method) for measuring soil water content requires destructive sampling and is unsuitable for continuous measurement. Techniques such as neutron thermalization and time domain reflectometry suffer relatively large errors in measuring soil water content near the surface. In a recent Methods of Soil Analysis article, the authors present the principles and procedures for using a heat-pulse sensor to determine near-surface soil water content.

AB  - The estimation of soil thermal conductivity (lambda) using the single-probe heat pulse (SPHP) method is well known, but estimation of soil water content (theta) using the SPHP is poorly understood. In this study, we examined six methods-lambda, normalized cumulative temperature increase (TNcum), normalized maximum temperature increase (TNmax), and the reciprocals of each-for theta estimation using the SPHP. The temperature response curves of four soils at different theta were measured following 600-s heat pulses with heating strengths of about 6 W m(-1), from which lambda, TNcum, and TNmax values were determined. The maximum measurement errors of these three methods were 0.11 m3 m(-3) for the coarse sand and 0.01 m(3) m(-3) for the fine sand, sandy loam, and silty clay, except for 0.05 m(3) m(-3) for the fine sand by the lambda(theta) method. The predicted theta from all of the lambda, TNcum, and TNmax methods agreed well with that from the oven-dry method for all soils with the exception of the TNcum(theta) and TNmax(theta) methods for the coarse sand for theta > 0.20 m(3) m(-3). The measurement errors and theta predictions of the 1/lambda(theta) method were similar to that of the TNcum(theta) and TNmax(theta) methods, and that of the 1/TNcum(theta) and 1/TNmax(theta) methods were similar to that of the lambda(theta) method. Because each of the six methods worked well for only some soils, improved estimations were obtained when the lambda(theta) method was combined with the 1/TNcum(theta) [or 1/TNmax(theta)] method for coarse-textured soils and the 1/l(theta) method was combined with the TNcum(theta) [or TNmax(theta)] method for fine-textured soils.

AB  - Accurate soil moisture measurements are key for optimising field irrigation and for the precise monitoring of water flow in soil profiles or large watersheds. In recent decades, various soil moisture sensors (SMSs) have been widely used, and several studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the SMS technologies under different soil and field conditions. The soluble salt content in soil can affect the sensitivity of SMSs because of their influence on soil permittivity. In this field study, we evaluated different types of SMSs in gypsiferous and salt-affected soils located at two agricultural sites in western Iraq. Two WaterScout capacitance sensors, SM100 and SMEC300, were evaluated in addition to the Watermark granular matrix sensor. Soil moisture measurements by the gravimetric method were compared with SMS readings. Bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) ranged be-tween 3.3-8.1 and 5.6-10.3 dS m-1 for sites 1 and 2 respectively, during the experiment. The results showed that site-specific calibration of the sensors significantly increased their accuracy. At Site 1, the RMSE values for the Watermark, SM100, and SMEC300 sensors changed from 3.48, 2.68, and 1.96 before calibration to 1.25, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. For site 2, the RMSE values changed from 3.78, 3.09, and 2.34, to 1.37, 1.03, and 0.95, respec-tively. After the site-specific calibration, the capacitance sensors were sufficiently accurate for scientific measurements. The granular matrix sensors should only be used for field irrigation management if a high-accuracy level is not required and only after site-specific calibration. (C) 2021 IAgrE.

AB  - The rapid development and wide application of the IoT (Internet of Things) has pushed toward the improvement of current practices in greenhouse technology and agriculture in general, through automation and informatization. The experimental and accurate determination of soil moisture is a matter of great importance in different scientific fields, such as agronomy, soil physics, geology, hydraulics, and soil mechanics. This paper focuses on the experimental characterization of a commercial low-cost "capacitive" coplanar soil moisture sensor that can be housed in distributed nodes for IoT applications. It is shown that at least for a well-defined type of soil with a constant solid matter to volume ratio, this type of capacitive sensor yields a reliable relationship between output voltage and gravimetric water content.

AB  - Commercial capacitive sensors are used to determinate soil moisture, but the probes can be expensive. The objective of this study was to calibrate the YL-69 sensor and compare its accuracy with two commercial ECH2O probes. The sensors were used to determinate soil moisture in an Entisol Orthent and an Oxisol Ustox, representative soils of Northeast Brazil. The greenhouse study was conducted at the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, Northeast Brazil, with two soils (Entisol Orthent and Oxisol Ustox). The experimental plots consisted of 5 replicates of 5 L pots, daily soil moisture was monitored from saturation to air dried. The soil textural classes were determined using the hydrometer method and the textural triangle of the Brazilian classification. After calibration, the YL-69 sensor performed well in both soils, obtaining a coefficient of determination (R-2) value > 0.90 and root mean square error (RMSE) <= 0.01 m(3) m(-3); however, this sensor did not perform well if not calibrated. As such, the YL-69 sensor performed as well as the EC-5 and 5TE probes. The low cost of the YL-69 sensor makes it an attractive replacement for the EC-5 and 5TE sensors in determining the water content in Entisol Orthent and Oxisol Ustox.

AB  - Three field experiments examined the effects of soil salinity on volumetric soil water content (SWC) measured with a capacitance sensor (CS). They were conducted in field-grown vegetable crops fertigated with complete nutrient solutions. Experiment 1 compared nutrient solutions with electrical conductivities (ECns,) of 6.5 dS m(-1) ((+)SAL) and 2.4 dS m(-1) (control), applied in equal volumes, following fertigation with ECns of 2.4 dS m(-1). Once (+)SAL commenced, SWC (0-20-cm depth) increased rapidly and then remained approximately 30% higher than in the control. Soil matric potential (SMP, 10-cm depth) was consistently very similar in both treatments. In Exp. 2, increasing ECns from 2.1 to 5.5 dS m(-1) in irrigation treatments receiving 100% of crop evaporation (ETc) and 25% of ETc caused SWC (0-20 cm) to respectively increase appreciably and maintain relatively constant values. Experiment 3 examined the effect of increased salinity and whether normalizing sensors with higher ECns alleviated this effect. Treatments were equal volumes of: (i) ECns of 5 dS m(-1) with sensor normalization at EC of 5.2 dS m(-1) (SAL-N5.2); (ii) ECns of 5 dS m(-1) with normalization at EC of 1.9 dS m(-1) (SAL-N1.9); and (iii) ECns of 1.9 dS m(-1) with normalization at 1.9 ds m(-1) (control). Previously, the three treatments were fertigated with ECns of 1.9 dS m(-1). The SWC (5-15 cm) increased by approximately 10% in both SAL-N5.2 and SAL-N1.9, and maintained relatively constant values in the control. The SMP (10 cm) was consistently very similar in the three treatments. Normalizing the CS at 5.2 or 1.9 dS m(-1) had no effect on the response to salinity. In the three experiments, changes in SWC generally paralleled changes in EC of soil water (ECsw,); relative increases were 4 to 7.5% in SWC for each 1 dS m(-1) increase in ECsw.

AB  - The monitoring of soil moisture and sea surface salinity over the Earth has been profoundly enhanced during the last thirteen years due to a new generation of satellite sensors. L-band radiometry is currently the only technology providing direct measurements of soil moisture, insensitive to surface roughness and distribution of elements in the soil, and the only technology the only technology for measuring that allows us to measure sea surface salinity from space. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite missions resolve global and local variability with a spatial resolution of approximately 43 km, a swath width close to 1000 km, and a sampling time, for each mission, of at least twice every 3 days. These resolutions and samplings can be increased by either merging data from the two sensors, and with complementary information gathered from other passive or active sensors, or with in situ information at higher spatial resolution. Numerous scientific studies based on the use of this new type of measurement have led to a better understanding and constraint of the processes governing the variability of the water cycle, ocean circulation and the Earth's climate. The continuity of measurements, and the increased spatial and radiometric resolution is critical for fulfilling scientific needs. Future L-band radiometry missions currently being planned in Europe (the Copernicus Imaging Microwave Radiometer), and in China (the Ocean Salinity mission) should provide better constraints on auxiliary parameters by combining multiple frequencies, but they will not have improved spatial resolution beyond SMOS and SMAP. The temporal continuity with SMOS and SMAP will likely not be ensured. In parallel, new concepts are being developed to increase spatial resolution of both land and ocean parameters.

AB  - Proper water management is crucial for agriculture, as its irrigation systems can waste approximately 60% of water. Using IoT for irrigation based on soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional time series modeling to predict soil moisture using two years of data on a US farm, including factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and weather. The models assessed were machine learning algorithms like Extreme Gradient Boosting and Random Forests, Deep Learning's Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network (StemGNN), and Vector Autoregression as a reference model. Random Forest was the most efficient and stable model. Furthermore, the spectral temporal graph neural network could not outperform the reference model. Comparing Random Forest with univariate algorithms like Naive, Exponential Smoothing, and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) showed univariate's better performance in 9 of 10 datasets, with ARIMA being best in 8. A substantial disparity is observed when considering the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric. ARIMA yields an MAPE of 0.052, while StemGNN reports 0.127 as the major difference. ARIMA achieves a MAPE of 0.046 for the minor difference, whereas StemGNN obtains 0.038. In the remaining eight datasets, ARIMA consistently outperforms StemGNN by at least 30%. In summary, modern methods could not beat the older methods in the study data sets.

AB  - Barley (Hordeum vulgare) is one of the most important crops in the world, ranking 4th in the worldwide production. Crop breeders are facing increasing environmental obstacles in the field, such as drought, salinity but also toxic over fertilization which not only impacts quality of the grain but also an yield. One of the most prevalent mechanisms of gene expression regulation in plants is microRNA-mediated silencing of target genes. We identified 13 barley microRNAs and 2 microRNAs* that are nitrogen excess responsive. Four microRNAs respond only in root, eight microRNAs only in shoot and one displays broad response in roots and shoots. We demonstrate that 2 microRNAs* are induced in barley shoot by nitrogen excess. For all microRNAs we identified putative target genes and confirmed microRNA-guided cleavage sites for ten out of thirteen mRNAs. None of the identified microRNAs or their target genes is known as nitrogen excess responsive. Analysis of expression pattern of thirteen target mRNAs and their cognate microRNAs showed expected correlations of their levels. The plant microRNAs analyzed are also known to respond to nitrogen deprivation and exhibit the opposite expression pattern when nitrogen excess/deficiency conditions are compared. Thus, they can be regarded as metabolic sensors of the regulation of nitrogen homeostasis in plants.

AB  - This study examined flat thin mm-sized soil moisture sensors (MSMS) fabricated using thermal press technology on thin compact disc (CD) to solve the long-standing problems of soil moisture profiling. The 10-month field tests conducted at a farm site compared three groups of MSMS with commercial capacitance-type soil moisture sensors (SMS) in terms of accuracy, sensitivity to environmental variations (e.g. water shock, temperatures, dry/ wet seasons) and long-term stability. MSMS sensors were mounted on the shallow, middle and deep locations of a hollow plastic rod (length: 1.1 m) and installed along the soil depth to profile the soil moisture variation. The resistance readings of MSMS sensors along soil depth were recorded in a real-time mode. Due to soil settlement over time after installation, the MSMS sensors in the shallow soil suffered from unstable readings, while the MSMS sensors in the middle and deep soil exhibited high stability and had the best correlation with water content values of commercial sensors (R-2 value: 0.6264). The contact between MSMS surface and soil particles appeared to be a critical factor determining the stability of MSMS readings. In addition, MSMS sensors showed a prompt response to the sharp change of soil moisture in the water shock tests. The soil moisture profiles collected from MSMS sensors captured the spatiotemporal variation of soil moisture, which enabled the simultaneous profiling at multiple locations. This field study demonstrated the great potential of mass deployment of low-cost but accurate MSMS sensors to achieve high resolution profiling for water-saving irrigation.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an indispensable element for all life on Earth and, during the past decade, concerns about the future of its global supply have stimulated much research on soil P and method development. This review provides an overview of advanced state-of-the-art methods currently used in soil P research. These involve bulk and spatially resolved spectroscopic and spectrometric P speciation methods (1 and 2D NMR, IR, Raman, Q-TOF MS/MS, high resolution-MS, NanoSIMS, XRF, XPS, (mu) XAS) as well as methods for assessing soil P reactions (sorption isotherms, quantum-chemical modeling, microbial biomass P, enzymes activity, DGT, P-33 isotopic exchange, O-18 isotope ratios). Required experimental set-ups and the potentials and limitations of individual methods present a guide for the selection of most suitable methods or combinations.

AB  - The soil moisture state partitions both mass and energy fluxes and is important for many hydro-geochemical cycles, but is often only measured within the surface layer. Estimating the amount of soil moisture in the root-zone from this information is difficult due to the nonlinear and heterogeneous nature of the various processes which alter the soil moisture state. Data-driven methods, such as artificial neural networks (ANN), mine data for nonlinear interdependencies and have potential for estimating root-zone soil moisture from surface soil moisture observations. To create an ANN root-zone model that was nonsite-specific and physically constrained, a training set was generated by forcing HYDRUS-1D with meteorological observations for different soil profiles from the unsaturated soil hydraulic database. Ensemble ANNs were trained to provide soil moisture at depths of 10, 20, and 50 cm below the surface using surface soil moisture observations and local meteorological information. Insights into the processes represented by the ANNs were derived from a clamping sensitivity analysis and by changing the ANNs input data. Further model testing based on synthetic soil moisture profiles from three McMaster Mesonet and three USDA soil climate analysis network sites suggests that ANNs are a flexible tool capable of predicting root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy. It was found that ANNs could well represent soil moisture as estimated by HYDRUS-1D, but performance was reduced in comparison to in situ soil moisture observations outside the training conditions. The transferability of the model appears limited to the same geographic region.

AB  - The article presents an in situ sensor to monitor soil moisture and water salinity by measuring soil permittivity and conductivity at a frequency 24 MHz via an admittance approach. It addresses difficulties encountered in other permittivity-based sensors. A self-balanced bridge provides on one measurement a digital output linear to capacitance and conductance of electrodes in soil with low offset, high phase resolution, and taking into account all parasitic impedances. Circuit design and procedures to achieve it are described, using electric circuit theory and component specifications. Probe geometry, two parallel cylinders, permits insertion in soil from surface, low disturbances and a high sample volume around electrodes. It provides an analytical relation to convert admittance to soil permittivity. Calibration of a sensor with air, alcohols and water fixes its sensitivity and residual phase and inductance for an uncertainty lower than 2% over a range up to 80 and 200 mS m(-1). Identical sensors can use same parameters after adjusting in one simple operation bridge phases. Thermal drift and its consequences on soil variable measurement are investigated and physical origins identified. It permits to reduce the phase drift within +/- 150 ppm degrees C(- 1 )rad to keep accuracy.

AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is becoming increasingly popular for monitoring soil water content (SWC). To retrieve SWC from observed neutron intensities, local measurements of SWC are typically required to calibrate a location-specific parameter, N-0 , in the corresponding transfer function. In this study, we develop a generalized conversion function that explicitly takes into account the different factors that govern local neutron intensity. Thus, the parameter N 0 becomes location independent, i.e. generally applicable. We demonstrate the feasibility of such a "general calibration function" by analysing 75 CRNS sites from four recently published datasets. Given the choice between the two calibration strategies - local or general - users will wonder which one is preferable. To answer this question, we estimated the resulting uncertainty in the SWC by means of error propagation. While the uncertainty in the local calibration depends on both the local reference SWC itself and its error, the uncertainty in the general calibration is mainly governed by the errors in vegetation biomass and soil bulk density. Our results suggest that a local calibration - generally considered best practice - might often not be the best option. In order to support the decision which calibration strategy - local or general - is actually preferable in the user-specific application context, we provide an interactive online tool that assesses the uncertainty in both options (https://cosmic-sense.github.io/local-or-global, last access: 23 February 2024).

AB  - Volumetric soil water content is commonly used for irrigation management in fruit trees. By integrating direct information on tree water status into measurements of soil water content, we can improve detection of water stress and irrigation scheduling. Thermal-based indicators can be an alternative to traditional measurements of midday stem water potential and stomatal conductance for irrigation management of pear trees (Pyrus communis L.). These indicators are easy, quick, and cost-effective. The soil and tree water status of two cultivars of pear trees 'D'Anjou' and 'Bartlett' submitted to regulated deficit irrigation was measured regularly in a pear orchard in Rock Island, WA (USA) for two seasons, 2021 and 2022. These assessments were compared to the canopy temperature (Tc), the difference between the canopy and air temperature (Tc-Ta) and the crop water stress index (CWSI). Trees under deficit irrigation had lower midday stem water potential and stomatal conductance but higher Tc, Tc-Ta, and CWSI. Tc was not a robust method to assess tree water status since it was strongly related to air temperature (R = 0.99). However, Tc-Ta and CWSI were greater than 0 degrees C or 0.5, respectively, and were less dependent on the environmental conditions when trees were under water deficits (midday stem water potential values< -1.2 MPa). Moreover, values of Tc-Ta = 2 degrees C and CWSI = 0.8 occurred when midday stem water potential was close to -1.5 MPa and stomatal conductance was lower than 200 mmol m(-2)s(-1). Soil water content (SWC) was the first indicator in detecting the deficit irrigation applied, however, it was not as strongly related to the tree water status as the thermal-based indicators. Thus, the relation between the indicators studied with the stem water potential followed the order: CWSI > Tc-Ta > SWC = Tc. A multiple regression analysis is proposed that combines both soil water content and thermal-based indices to overcome limitations of individual use of each indicator.

AB  - Monitoring volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) is the key for assessing water availability and nutrient fluxes. This study evaluated the empirical accuracy of theta(v) measurements using standard and in situ calibrated frequency domain reflectometers (FDR) with gravimetric water content and bulk density measurements of 1512 samples gathered from 15 profiles across 5 ICP Forests level II intensive monitoring plots. The predicted theta(v), calibrated with standard functions, predominantly underestimated the real water content. The measurement error exceeded the threshold of 0.03 m(3) m(-3) in 93% of all soil layers. Layer specific calibration removed bias and reduced the overall prediction error with a factor up to 2.8. A simple linear regression often provided the best calibration model; temperature correction was helpful in specific cases. To adequately remove bias in our study plots, a calibration dataset of up to 24 monthly observations was required for topsoils (whereas 12 observations sufficed for subsoils). Based on estimated precision errors, 3 sensors per soil layer proved to be sufficient, while up to 16 sensors are needed to meet the required accuracy in organic topsoils. Validating FDR sensor outputs using in situ gravimetric measurements is essential for quality control and assurance of long term theta(v) monitoring and for improving site specific instrumentalization.

AB  - The soil and water assessment tool (SWAT) is a physically based model that is used extensively to simulate hydrologic processes in a wide range of climates around the world. SWAT uses spatial hydrometeorological data to simulate runoff through the computation of a retention curve number. The objective of the present study was to compare the performance of two approaches used for the calculation of curve numbers in SWAT, that is, the Revised Soil Moisture Index (SMI), which is based on previous meteorological conditions, and the Soil Moisture Condition II (SMCII), which is based on soil features for the prediction of flow. The results showed that the sensitive parameters for the SMI method are land-use and land-cover features. However, for the SMCII method, the soil and the channel are the sensitive parameters. The performances of the SMI and SMCII methods were analyzed using various indices. We concluded that the fair performance of the SMI method in an arid region may be due to the inherent characteristics of the method since it relies mostly on previous meteorological conditions and does not account for the soil features of the catchment.

AB  - There are multiple methods being used for scheduling irrigation applications that range from weather-based to ground-based methods. Growers must choose a method that is ideally both accurate and economical to use in a production agriculture system. One method that has been used is model-based scheduling. In this study, the CROPGRO-Soybean model in the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) was used to simulate the growth and development of irrigated soybean for a production soybean field throughout the 2018 and 2020 growing seasons. Model predictions were compared to soil moisture data recorded from 44 sensor sets placed across the field on a 55- x 55-m grid at depths of 31 and 61 cm. Results showed that the model accurately predicted plant height and LAI in 2018 and 2020. In both seasons, the model underpredicted soil moisture and occasionally did not respond to irrigation or rainfall. Even though the model underpredicted soil moisture, it predicted fewer irrigation events and half the cumulative amount in 2018 than the farmer applied and similar irrigation events and quantity in 2020. DSSAT predicted yield well for both years as compared to measured yields, indicating the farmer may have over-irrigated in 2018. This study advances the application of DSSAT for estimating soybean vegetative characteristics and irrigation scheduling in a production environment.

AB  - A merging procedure is applied to five daily rainfall estimates achieved via SM2RAIN applied to the soil moisture products obtained by the Advanced SCATterometer, the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, the Soil Moisture Active and Passive mission, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity mission and backscattering observations of RapidScat. The precipitation estimates are evaluated against dense ground networks in the period ranging from April to December, 2015, in India and in Italy, at 0.25 degrees/daily spatial/temporal resolution.
   The merged product derived by combining the different SM2RAIN rainfall products shows better results in term of statistical and categorical metrics with respect to the use of the single products. A good agreement with reference to ground observations is obtained, with median correlations equal to 0.65 and 0.77 in India and in Italy, respectively. The merged dataset is found to slightly outperform those of the IMERG product of the Global Precipitation Measurement mission underlying the large potential of the proposed approach.

TI  - Calculating a minimum overlap period for successful intercalibration of soil moisture sensors
T2  - VADOSE ZONE JOURNAL
LA  - English
KW  - IN-SITU
AB  - Long-term in situ soil moisture monitoring inevitably requires sensors to be replaced. Ensuing discontinuities in the data record can be mitigated by intercalibration, however it is unclear how long the existing sensor needs to remain alongside the newly installed before there is enough overlapping data to generate a robust intercalibration. We used 154 pairs of established and newly installed sensors within the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed to determine if there is a minimum overlap time that should be considered when planning upcoming replacements. Hourly observations of the existing sensor were linearly calibrated to those of the newly installed sensor with coefficients determined from overlap periods incremented by 30 days until a reference period of 2 years was reached. The resulting bias, root-mean-square error, and correlation coefficient for sensor pairs indicate that a minimum of 6 to 9 months of overlapping data are required to generate a successful intercalibration. Extending that to a full year before decommissioning the old sensor results in a stable intercalibration with higher confidence.
   Intercalibration mitigates discontinuities in long-term soil moisture records caused by sensor replacement. Sensor pairs in a testbed are intercalibrated based on the initial 1 to 24 months of overlap and then validated. We recommend that a year be considered the minimum overlap period for statistical and practical reasons.

AB  - Soil moisture profile sensors (SMPSs) have a high potential for climate-smart agriculture due to their easy handling and ability to perform simultaneous measurements at different depths. To date, an accurate and easy-to-use method for the evaluation of long SMPSs is not available. In this study, we developed laboratory and field experiments to evaluate three different SMPSs (SoilVUE10, Drill & Drop, and SMT500) in terms of measurement accuracy, sensor-to-sensor variability, and temperature stability. The laboratory experiment features a temperature-controlled lysimeter to evaluate intra-sensor variability and temperature stability of SMPSs. The field experiment features a water level-controlled sandbox and reference TDR measurements to evaluate the soil water measurement accuracy of the SMPS. In both experiments, a well-characterized fine sand was used as measurement medium to ensure homogeneous dielectric properties in the measurement domain of the sensors. The laboratory experiments with the lysimeter showed that the Drill & Drop sensor has the highest temperature sensitivity with a decrease of 0.014 m(3) m(-3) per 10 & DEG;C, but at the same time showed the lowest intra- and inter-sensor variability. The field experiment with the sandbox showed that all three SMPSs have a similar performance (average RMSE & AP; 0.023 m(3) m(-3)) with higher uncertainties at intermediate soil moisture contents. The presented combination of laboratory and field tests were found to be well suited to evaluate the performance of SMPSs and will be used to test additional SMPSs in the future.

AB  - Soil moisture is the key link among hydroecological compartments, responding dynamically to sequences of atmospheric processes and management conditions and modulating physical, chemical, and biological processes in the soil. Currently, there are a variety of monitoring techniques to measure, directly or indirectly, the soil moisture. However, some practical issues remain open like the definition a priori of the number, location and depth of the monitoring points, and the impact of failing or poor performance soil moisture sensors. Here, we present a set of techniques, namely Delta theta time series, wavelet filtering, and time stability, to identify representative points and monitoring depths through an analysis of hourly soil moisture time series for different configuration of the monitoring network. We used real data from a monitoring network consisting of seven monitoring points, each one with four EC-5 probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA) at 20, 40, 60, and 100 cm. The use of simple time series of Delta theta allowed us to assess the spatiotemporal influence of the monitoring points, while the wavelet periodograms allowed us to get insight about the response of the monitoring points at different time scales. Both methods are easy to implement or adapt to specific conditions, being coherent to the results derived from time stability analysis. For our case study, we concluded that we could reallocate 16 sensors (out of 28) without a significant loss of information. However, the final decision strongly relies on a deep knowledge of the site features and the objectives of the monitoring network.

AB  - Soil water content (SWC) is a crucial parameter in ecology, agriculture, hydrology, and engineering studies. Research on non-invasive monitoring of SWC has been a long-lasting topic in these fields. Ground penetrating radar (GPR), a non-destructive geophysical technique, has the advantages of high resolution, deep detection depth, and high efficiency in SWC measurements at medium scale. It has been successfully applied in field investigations. This paper summarizes the recent progress in developing GPR-based SWC measurement methods, including reflected wave, ground wave, surface reflection, borehole GPR, full waveform inversion, average envelope amplitude, and frequency shift methods. The principles, advantages, limitations, and applications of these methods are described in detail. A comprehensive technical framework, which comprises the seven methods, is proposed to understand their principles and applicability. Two key procedures, namely, data acquisition and data processing, are emphasized as crucial to method applications. The suitable methods that will satisfy diverse application demands and field conditions are recommended. Future development, potential applications, and advances in hardware and data processing techniques are also highlighted.

AB  - Automated soil moisture systems are commonly used in precision agriculture. Using low-cost sensors, the spatial extension can be maximized, but the accuracy might be reduced. In this paper, we address the trade-off between cost and accuracy comparing low-cost and commercial soil moisture sensors. The analysis is based on the capacitive sensor SKU:SEN0193 tested under lab and field conditions. In addition to individual calibration, two simplified calibration techniques are proposed: universal calibration, based on all 63 sensors, and a single-point calibration using the sensor response in dry soil. During the second stage of testing, the sensors were coupled to a low-cost monitoring station and installed in the field. The sensors were capable of measuring daily and seasonal oscillations in soil moisture resulting from solar radiation and precipitation. The low-cost sensor performance was compared to commercial sensors based on five variables: (1) cost, (2) accuracy, (3) qualified labor demand, (4) sample volume, and (5) life expectancy. Commercial sensors provide single-point information with high reliability but at a high acquisition cost, while low-cost sensors can be acquired in larger numbers at a lower cost, allowing for more detailed spatial and temporal observations, but with medium accuracy. The use of SKU sensors is then indicated for short-term and limited-budget projects in which high accuracy of the collected data is not required.

AB  - Measurements of dielectric permittivity and electrical conductivity were taken in a saline gypsiferous soil collected from southern Tunisia. Both time domain reflectometry (TDR) and the new WET sensor based on frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) were used. Seven different moistening solutions were used with electrical conductivities of 0.0053-14 dS m(-1). Different models for describing the observed relationships between dielectric permittivity (K-a) and water content (theta), and bulk electrical conductivity (ECa) and pore water electrical conductivity (ECp) were tested and evaluated. The commonly used K-a-theta models by Topp et al. (1980) and Ledieu et al. (1986) cannot be recommended for the WET sensor. With these models, the RMSE and the mean relative error of the predicted theta were about 0.04 m(3) m(-3) and 19% for TDR and 0.08 m(3) m(-3) and 54% for WET sensor measurements, respectively. Using the Hilhorst (2000) model for ECp predictions, the RMSE was 1.16 dS m(-1) and 4.15 dS m(-1) using TDR and the WET sensor, respectively. The WET sensor could give similar accuracy to TDR if calibrated values of the soil parameter were used instead of standard values.

AB  - Real time measurements of soil water content play a critical role in many fields of science as agronomy, geology, engineering, and hydrology. In the last years, agriculture has become one of the most important application fields of soil water sensors technology in order to optimize the irrigation process and to guarantee sustainable water resources management. This work provides a review on the latest emerging methodologies based on optical fiber sensing for soil moisture monitoring for agricultural and hydrological applications. In particular, the main studies referring to optical fiber sensors based on a variation of the refractive index of the external medium, sensors based on heated distributed temperature sensor (HDTS) and sensors based on Fiber Bragg Gratings (FBG) or Long Period Gratings (LPG) are here explored. Finally, some approaches based on the NIR absorbance spectroscopy are proposed for measuring the soil water content. Most of these approaches and technologies are still in a prototyping phase and only few of them are properly evaluated in situ real context.

AB  - The growing scarcity and competition for water resources requires the urgent implementation of measures to ensure their rational use. Farmers need affordable irrigation tools that allow them to take advantage of scientific know-how to improve water use efficiency in their common irrigation practices. The aim of this study is to test under field conditions, and adjust where required, an automated irrigation system that allows the establishment of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies in a stone fruit orchard. For this, an automated device with an algorithm which combines water-balance-based irrigation scheduling with a feedback adjustment mechanism using 15 capacitive sensors for continuous soil moisture measurement was used. The tests were carried out in 2016 and 2017 in Vegas Bajas del Guadiana (Extremadura, Spain) on an experimental plot of 'Red Beaut', an early-maturing Japanese plum cultivar. Three irrigation treatments were established: control, RDI and automatic. The control treatment was scheduled to cover crop water needs, a postharvest deficit irrigation (40% crop evapotranspiration (ETc)) strategy was applied in the RDI treatment, while the Automatic treatment simulated the RDI but without human intervention. After two years of testing, the automated system was able to "simulate" the irrigation scheduling programmed by a human expert without the need for human intervention.

AB  - Measuring soil moisture with cosmic-ray neutrons is a promising technique for intermediate spatial scales. To convert neutron counts to average volumetric soil water content a simple calibration function can be used (the N-0-calibration of Desilets et al., 2010). The calibration is based on soil water content derived directly from soil samples taken within the footprint of the sensor. We installed a cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRS) in a mixed forest in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany and calibrated it 10 times throughout one calendar year. Each calibration with the N-0-calibration function resulted in a different CRS soil moisture time series, with deviations of up to 0.1 m(3) m(-3) (24% of the total range) for individual values of soil water content. Also, many of the calibration efforts resulted in time series that could not be matched with independent in situ measurements of soil water content. We therefore suggest a modified calibration function with a different shape that can vary from one location to another. A two-point calibration was found to effectively define the shape of the modified calibration function if the calibration points were taken during both dry and wet conditions spanning at least half of the total range of soil moisture. The best results were obtained when the soil samples used for calibration were linearly weighted as a function of depth in the soil profile and nonlinearly weighted as a function of distance from the CRS, and when the depth-specific amount of soil organic matter and lattice water content was explicitly considered. The annual cycle of tree foliation was found to be a negligible factor for calibration because the variable hydrogen mass in the leaves was small compared to the hydrogen mass changes by soil moisture variations. As a final point, we provide a calibration guide for a CRS in forested environments.

AB  - Most of the winter vegetable production in the southeastern United States is located in Florida. High-value vegetable crops are grown under intensive fertilization and irrigation management practices using drip, overhead, or seepage irrigation systems. Rainfall events may raise the water table in fields irrigated by seepage irrigation resulting in leaching of nutrients when the level is lowered to remove excess water. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases on rainfall distribution and leaching rain occurrences during the fall, winter, and spring tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) growing seasons using long-term weather records available for main producing areas. Differences in fall growing season mean precipitation during El Nino, La Nina, and neutral years were found to be nonsignificant. Winter and spring mean precipitations during El Nino, La Nina, and neutral years were found to be significantly different. Winter and spring average rainfall amounts during La Nina and neutral years were lower than during El Nino years. During El Nino years, at least one leaching rainfall event of 1.0 inch or more in 1 day occurred at all locations and all planting seasons and two of these events occurred in more than 9 of 10 years except during the winter and spring planting seasons at the Tamiami Trail station located in Miami-Dade County. During the fall growing season of El Nino years, three to four 1.0 inch or more in 1-day leaching rainfalls may be expected at least 4 of 5 years at all locations. In the case of larger leaching rainfall events (3.0 inches or more recorded in 3 days or 4.0 inches or more recorded in 7 days), the probability of having at least one event was mostly less than 0.80. Based on these results, nitrogen fertilizer supplemental applications of 30 to 120 lb/acre could be applied during the fall growing season of all ENSO phases and during all planting seasons of El Nino years. Using current fertilizer prices, one supplemental fertilizer application of 30 lb/acre nitrogen and 16.6 lb/acre potassium costs $55/acre. Assuming a median wholesale price of $12 per 25-lb box, this additional cost may be offset by a modest yield increase of 4.6 boxes/acre (compared with a typical 2500 25-lb box/acre marketable yield). These results suggest that ENSO phases could be used to predict supplemental fertilizer needs for tomato, but adjustments to local weather conditions may be needed.

AB  - Collecting accurate real-time soil moisture data in crop root zones is the foundation of automated precision irrigation systems. Soil moisture sensors (SMSs) have been used to monitor soil water content (SWC) in crop fields for a long time; however, there is no generally accepted guideline for determining optimal number and placement of soil moisture sensors in the soil profile. In order to study adequate positioning for the installation of soil moisture sensors in the soil profile, six years of field experiments were carried out in North China Plain (NCP). Soil water content was measured using the gravimetric method every 7 to 10 days during six growing seasons of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L), and root distribution was measured using a soil core method during the key periods of winter wheat growth. The results from the experimental data analysis show that SWC at different depths had a high linear correlation. In addition, the values of correlation coefficients decreased with increasing soil depth; the coefficient of variation (CV) of SWC was higher in the surface layers than in the deeper layers (depths were 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm during the early, middle, and last stages of winter wheat, respectively); wheat roots were mainly distributed in the surface layer. According to an analysis of CV for SWC and root distribution, the depths of planned wetted layers were determined to be 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm during the sowing to reviving stages (the early stage of winter wheat), returning green and jointing stages (the middle stage of winter wheat), and heading to maturity stage (the last stage of winter wheat), respectively. The correlation and R-cluster analyses of SWC at different layers in the soil profile showed that SMSs should be installed 10 and 30 cm below the soil surface during the winter wheat growing season. The linear regression model can be built using SWC at depths of 10 and 30 cm to predict total average SWC in the soil profile. The results of validation showed that the developed model provided reliable estimates of total average SWC in the planned wetted layer. In brief, this study suggests that suitable positioning of soil moisture sensors is at depths of 10 and 30 cm below the soil surface.

AB  - Although many methods of soil moisture measurement exist, there remains a lack of soil moisture sensor with small volume, high precision, excellent real-time performance and distributed monitoring capability. In this paper, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based carbon fiber heated sensor (CFHS) that can overcome the deficiencies in soil moisture movement is proposed. The CFHS consists of a carbon fiber rod with a diameter of 5 mm, quas-distributed FBG sensors on an optical fiber, a coating, two binding posts, and two electric cables. Laboratory calibration tests have been conducted to establish an empirical piece-wise relationship between the temperature characteristic value and soil moisture for sand, silt and clay. A laboratory validation test under normal gravity and a centrifuge test under overweight conditions, have been performed to verify the feasibility of this technique for soil moisture monitoring. The test results show that the CFHS can (i) accurately record soil moisture under normal gravitational and overweight conditions and (ii) track the evolution of capillary zones, and the generation and migration of moisture transition zones under centrifuge acceleration. During a response period of 5 min, the accuracy is 0.033m(3)/m(3) under 1 g condition, and 0.047m(3)/m(3) under overweight condition. With the advantages of small sensor size, low disturbance of soil mass and wide adaptability in physical model tests, the proposed method can achieve distributed soil moisture measurement at different scales and with high efficiency.

   The proposed approach for estimating reference evapotranspiration allows obtaining accurate approximations of this important crop parameter in an inexpensive way by using moisture sensors, which can be translated to an optimization of water resources.
   Abstract One of the most important applications of remote imaging systems in agriculture, with the greatest impact on global sustainability, is the determination of optimal crop irrigation. The methodology proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is based on estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is done by computing the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by a crop coefficient (Kc). Some previous works proposed methods to compute Kc using remote crop images. The present research aims at complementing these systems, estimating ETo with the use of soil moisture sensors. A crop of kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) was used as the reference crop. Four frequency-domain reflectometry sensors were installed, gathering moisture information during the study period from May 2015 to September 2016. Different machine learning regression algorithms were analyzed for the estimation of ETo using moisture and climatic data. The values were compared with respect to the ETo computed in an agroclimatic station using the Penman-Monteith method. The best method was the randomizable filtered classifier technique, based on the K* algorithm. This model achieved a correlation coefficient, R, of 0.9936, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.183 mm/day and 6.52% mean relative error; the second-best model used artificial neural networks, with an R of 0.9470 and 11% relative error. Thus, this new methodology allows obtaining accurate and cost-efficient prediction models for ETo, as well as for the water balance of the crops.

AB  - Climate change increases the occurrence and severity of droughts due to increasing temperatures, altered circulation patterns, and reduced snow occurrence. While Europe has suffered from drought events in the last decade unlike ever seen since the beginning of weather recordings, harmonized long-term datasets across the continent are needed to monitor change and support predictions. Here we present soil moisture data from 66 cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) in Europe (COSMOS-Europe for short) covering recent drought events. The CRNS sites are distributed across Europe and cover all major land use types and climate zones in Europe. The raw neutron count data from the CRNS stations were provided by 24 research institutions and processed using state-of-the-art methods. The harmonized processing included correction of the raw neutron counts and a harmonized methodology for the conversion into soil moisture based on available in situ information. In addition, the uncertainty estimate is provided with the dataset, information that is particularly useful for remote sensing and modeling applications. This paper presents the current spatiotemporal coverage of CRNS stations in Europe and describes the protocols for data processing from raw measurements to consistent soil moisture products. The data of the presented COSMOS-Europe network open up a manifold of potential applications for environmental research, such as remote sensing data validation, trend analysis, or model assimilation The dataset could be of particular importance for the analysis of extreme climatic events at the continental scale. Due its timely relevance in the scope of climate change in the recent years, we demonstrate this potential application with a brief analysis on the spatiotemporal soil moisture variability.

AB  - Capacitance type sensors have been widely used to monitor soil water content and salinity, but little is known about their response to specific ions in soil solution. The goal of this laboratory study was to investigate the sensitivity of two capacitance probes, ECH(2)O EC-5 and EC-10, to NO(3) concentration in soil solutions, as well as to understand the differences in sensor response to the presence of other ions in the solutions. Forty-five uniformly packed soil samples were prepared using a homogenized loam soil wetted to five volumetric water contents (VWC) with nine solutions containing different concentrations of NO(3)(-), Cl(-), or both. A two-stage analysis of the normalized data revealed that ion type and concentration had a significant effect (P similar to 0.01) only for the response of the EC-10 probes operating at a frequency of 5 MHz. The response of the EC-5 probes, operating at 70 MHz, was mainly explained by changes in VWC. Multiple linear regression models fitted to the EC-10 response to individual solutions showed that concentration had a statistically significant predictive value only for samples wetted with NO(3) solutions when temperature was incorporated in the model. The study confirmed that capacitance probes operating at a relatively low frequency of 5 MHz are more sensitive to changes in NO(3) concentration than in Cl. We attributed this effect to the difference in ion mass that manifests through an increase in conductivity at ion-specific frequency. Additional experimental work is needed, however, to accurately define optimal frequencies for measuring ion-induced effects on dielectric measurement and to quantify interrelations between them.

AB  - Printing electronics allows us to fabricate low-cost, simple sensor networks. Distributed soil moisture sensors in agriculture industry will result in better water management practices; however, price and reliability do not allow for ubiquitous availability. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of low-cost, flexible, interdigitated electrode (IDE) soil moisture sensors with the electrode widths of 537, 877, 1055, 1204, and 1916 mu m on polyimide (PI) substrates using a silver nanoparticle (Ag NP) ink. The sensors were tested in sandy textured soil with a volumetric water content ranging from 0.05 to 0.25 m(3)/m(3). Analytically, the sensitivities of all the sensors are expected to be equal, as the proposed mechanisms dictate that the capacitance should depend linearly on the dielectric constant of the moist soil. However, we found the sensitivity for the widest IDE, which measured 1916 mu m to be 442 pF/H2O volumetric percentage, whereas the sensitivity for the sensor with 537-mu m-wide electrodes to be only 221 pF/H2O volumetric percentage. We hypothesized that the increase in sensitivity can be directly related to the increase in the capacitive fringing field height, which results in increased sensing volume for the widest IDE. The increased sensing volume leads to increased water molecule polarization, increasing the overall capacitance change with respect to changing water content. To validate the hypothesis, we conducted electric fringing field experiments to observe the trend between the maximum fringing field height and the electrode width of an IDE. Results confirmed that increased sensing volume was caused by the increased fringing field height of the electrode in an IDE.

AB  - Irrigation is essential for maintaining food production in water-scarce regions. The irrigation need depends on the water content of the soil, which we measured with the novel technique of cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS). The potential of the CRNS technique for drip irrigation scheduling was explored in this study for the Picassent site near Valencia, Spain. To support the experimental evidence, the neutron transport simulation URANOS was used to simulate the effect of drip irrigation on the neutron counts. The overall soil water content (SWC) in the CRNS footprint was characterized with a root mean square error <0.03 cm(3)/cm(3), but the experimental dataset indicated methodological limitations to detect drip water input. Both experimental data and simulation results suggest that the large-area neutron response to drip irrigation is insignificant in our specific case using a standard CRNS probe. Because of the small area of irrigated patches and short irrigation time, the limited SWC changes due to drip irrigation were not visible from the measured neutron intensity changes. Our study shows that CRNS modeling can be used to assess the suitability of the CRNS technique for certain applications. While the standard CRNS probe was not able to detect small-scale drip irrigation patterns, the method might be applicable for larger irrigated areas, in drier regions, and for longer and more intense irrigation periods. Since statistical noise is the main limitation of the CRNS measurement, the capability of the instrument could be improved in future studies by larger and more efficient neutron detectors.

AB  - The purpose of this article was to compare soil phosphorus (P) extraction by sodium bicarbonate solution (Olsen P) and by ammonium lactate (AL P) and to create a model for prediction of Olsen P using ordinary soil-fertility control data. The soils data used in this study included Olsen P, pH KCl, pH H2O, organic matter, AL P, and AL K. Soil pH(KCl) ranged from 3.5 to 8, organic matter up to 5%, AL K up to 400 mg kg(-1), and AL P up to 200 mg kg(-1). Olsen P and AL P were significantly correlated, and the difference between them was influenced by soil pH. Regression models included all soil data grouped by soil pH range, which significantly decreased the difference between predicted and measured Olsen P. The validation of the model was conducted on new data sets from field fertilization trials. The results show that Olsen P can be related to AL P and used for fertilizer recommendations instead of AL P.

AB  - The present work demonstrates a methodology for acquiring high-resolution soil moisture information, namely at 1 km at a daily time step, utilizing data from a sparse network of soil moisture sensors and remotely sensed Land Surface Temperature (LST). Building on previous research and highlighting the strong correlation between surface soil moisture and LST, as a result of the thermal inertia, we first, evaluated the correlation between Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LST and ground-based soil moisture information from soil moisture sensors installed in a pilot area in Northeastern Greece, namely the Komotini test site, from October 2021. Second, a regression formula was developed for three out of six soil moisture sensors, keeping the three remaining monitoring stations serving as a validation set. Furthermore, regression coefficients were interpolated at 1 km and the regression equations were applied for the entire study area, thus acquiring soil moisture information at a spatial resolution of 1 km at the daily time step. The verification process indicated a reasonable accuracy, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of <0.02 m(3)/m(3). The results were considerably better than using a simple interpolation or downscaled daily 1-km SMAP soil moisture.

AB  - The recent and projected investments across the world on radar satellite missions (e.g., Sentinel-1, SAOCOM, BIOMASS and NISAR) provide a great opportunity for operational radar soil moisture mapping with high spatial and temporal resolution. However, there is no retrieval algorithm that can make complementary use of the multi-frequency data from those missions, due to the large uncertainties in observations collected by the different sensors, different validity regions of the forward models, and the fact that inversion algorithms have been designed for specific data sources. In this study, the principle of ensemble learning was introduced to provide two general soil moisture retrieval frameworks accounting for these issues. Instead of trying to find an optimal global solution, multiple soil moisture retrievals (termed sub-retrievals) with moderate performance were first obtained using different channels and/or time instances randomly selected from the available data, with the retrieved ensemble of results being the final output. The ensemble retrievals, taking one existing snapshot method and two multi-temporal methods as the base retrieval algorithms, were evaluated using a synthetic data set with the effectiveness confirmed under various uncertainty sources. An evaluation using the Fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) data set showed that the ensemble retrieval outperformed the non-ensemble retrieval in most cases, with a decrease of 0.004 to 0.014 m(3)/m(3) in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and an increase of 0.01 to 0.16 in correlation coefficient (R). Weakly biased and correlated sub-retrievals were confirmed to be the basic requirement of an effective ensemble retrieval, being consistent with use of ensemble learning in other applications.

AB  - Evapotranspiration (ET) is one of the most important elements of water balance. Despite its importance, exact determination for a mosaic surface cover is very limited; therefore, there is a demand for relatively simple and cheap methods of determination that work on a small spatial scale.
   Water uptake of forest vegetation in groundwater discharge areas generally has a strong influence on the water resources induced diurnal signal in soil moisture, and in the water table. Diurnal methods in a shallow groundwater environment are widely used nowadays for ET estimation.
   By modifying the well-known White (1932) method and adapting to soil moisture data, a new technique was developed to calculate ET from soil moisture readings, eliminating the need of specific yield (a weakest point of the groundwater signal based methods). The new method was validated using hydro-meteorological data of the Hidegviz Valley experimental catchment located in the Sopron Hills at the western border of Hungary.
   The 30-min ET rates of the proposed method lag 30-60 minutes behind those of the reference Penman-Monteith method, but otherwise the two estimates compare favorably.
   On a daily basis, the newly derived ET rates are very close to PM estimates, but on average, they are 38% higher than the ones obtainable with the original White method. Comparing the ET rates of the proposed method with traditional ET estimates from soil moisture, a significant difference can be ascertained.
   The proposed method has potential benefits in groundwater discharge areas, especially in light of the changing climate with its warmer and drier growing seasons, that will likely result in limited water resources.

AB  - Substrate clogging seriously affects the lifetime and treatment performance of subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SSF CWs), and the quantitative detection of clogging is the key challenge in the management of substrate clogging. This paper explores the feasibility of the resistivity method to detect the clogging degree of an SSF CW. The clogged substrate was found to have a high water-holding capacity, which led to low apparent resistivity in the draining phase. On the basis of the resistivity characteristics, clogging quantification was performed with a standard laboratory procedure, i.e., the Wenner method used in a Miller Soil Box. The apparent resistivity to sediment fraction (v/v) (ARSF) model was established to evaluate the degree of clogging from the apparent resistivity. The results showed that the ARSF model fit well with the actual values (linear slope = 0.986; R-squared = 0.98). The methods for in situ resistivity detection were applied in a lab-scale horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland (HSSF CW). Combined with the ARSF model, the two-probe method demonstrated high accuracy for clogging quantification (relative error less than 9%). These results suggest that the resistivity method is a reliable and feasible technique for in situ detection of clogging in SSF CWs.

AB  - Interpolating soil moisture at the regional scale (10(4)-10(7) km(2)) is challenging because in situ observations tend to be sparse, and hydrometeorological conditions and soil characteristics have significant spatial variability. This study is the first to apply the reduced optimal interpolation (ROI) method to soil moisture. The ROI method uses both in situ and variable infiltration capacity (VIC) simulated-soil moisture to generate interpolated soil moisture surfaces in Oklahoma. The ROI method is based on an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis that identifies the leading spatial modes of soil moisture variation based on the model simulation and then applies these EOFs using the temporal variations in the observed soil moisture. The interpolated soil moisture surfaces generated using ROI are compared with Cokriging, which also uses VIC simulations as a secondary input, and the inverse distance weighting (IDW) approach. The accuracy of all three interpolation methods are evaluated using soil moisture measurements from 65 stations. The ROI method is significantly more accurate than IDW and it also outperforms Cokriging. We demonstrate that ROI can be used to accurately depict the spatial patterns of soil moisture at the local and regional level.

AB  - While wireless sensor networks (WSNs) become more popular as a tool for scientists and engineers in environmental monitoring, the energy efficiency of WSN's primary unit, the mote, is increasingly critical. Motes perform communication and processing functions and also take measurements using limited onboard battery power. For environmental monitoring deployment, sampling rates need to be assigned to motes such that useful information can be extracted over both spatial and temporal scales. The data sampling rate, which is intimately related to data transmission rate, plays an important role in the mote's battery life. Moreover, while it has been noted that mote operation continues under less than optimal power supply levels, data collected during this time undergoes attenuation from the desired measurement. That is, low battery conditions of motes could significantly affect the accuracy of sensed data. This paper investigates the above two issues to achieve extended battery life for individual wireless motes while maintaining sampling adequacy and reliability in transmitting accurate data. We first study how different sensor characteristics, such as different types of sap flow sensors, can affect motes' sampling and transmission rate. Then, we examine the effect of sensing attenuation due to low battery power on sap flow, soil moisture, and soil water potential measurements. A simple regression model was found to correct data for both the sap flow and soil water potential sensors sampled on under-powered motes. By operating under less than optimal power levels, this effectively increases motes' battery life for reliable data collection from wireless sensor networks.

AB  - This study evaluated the performance of three soil water content sensors (CS616/625, Campbell Scientific, Inc., Logan, UT; TDT, Acclima, Inc., Meridian, ID; 5TE, Decagon Devices, Inc., Pullman, WA) and a soil water potential sensor (Watermark 200SS, Irrometer Company, Inc., Riverside, CA) in laboratory and field conditions. Soil water content/potential values measured by the sensors were compared with corresponding volumetric water content (theta(v), m(3) m(-3)) values derived from gravimetric samples, ranging approximately from the permanent wilting point (PWP) to field capacity (FC) volumetric water contents. Under laboratory and field conditions, the factory-based calibrations of theta(v) did not consistently achieve the required accuracy for any sensor in the sandy clay loam, loamy sand, and clay loam soils of eastern Colorado. Salt (calcium chloride dihydrate) added to the soils in the laboratory caused the CS616, TDT, and 5TE sensors to experience errors in their volumetric water content readings with increased bulk soil electrical conductivity (EC; dS m(-1)). Results from field tests in sandy clay loam and loamy sand soils indicated that a linear calibration (equations provided) for the TDT, CS616 and 5TE sensors (and a logarithmic calibration for the Watermark sensors) could reduce the errors of the factory calibration of theta(v) to less than 0.02 +/- 0.035 m(3) m(-3). Furthermore, the performance evaluation tests confirmed that each individual sensor needed a unique calibration equation for every soil type and location in the field. In addition, the calibrated van Genuchten (1980) equation was as accurate as the calibrated logarithmic equation and can be used to convert soil water potential (kPa) to volumetric soil water content (m(3) m(-3)). Finally, analysis of the theta(v) field data indicated that the CS616, 5TE and Watermark sensor readings were influenced by diurnal fluctuations in soil temperature, while the TDT was not influenced. Therefore, it is recommended that the soil temperature be considered in the calibration process of the CS616, 5TE, and Watermark sensors. Further research will be aimed towards determining the need of sensor calibration for every agricultural season. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The study aimed at the evaluation of the accumulation and vertical distribution of different forms of phosphorus (P) in reference to phosphorus sorption properties subject to mineral (NPK), mineral-organic (NPK + M), and organic (M) fertilisation. It was carried out in a long-term experimental field in Skierniewice (Central Poland) conducted since 1923 under rye monoculture. Total P content in the M and NPK soil profile was similar and lower than in the NPK + M soil. The content of organic P in A(p) and E-et horizons of both manured soils was similar and higher than in the NPK soil. The Langmuir P sorption maximum (S-max) in the studied soils ranged from 39.7 to 90 mg P/kg, while the Freundlich P sorption coefficient a(F) ranged from 6.9 to 41.9 mg P/kg. Higher variability of parameters related to the binding energy from the Lanqmuir (k) and Freundlich (a(F)) equations was determined between soil horizons than between the fertilisation systems. Nonetheless, in M and NPK + M soils, sorption parameters a(F) and S-max and binding energy (k, b(F)) were considerably lower than in the NPK soil. The content of water extracted P in manured soils was higher than in the NPK soil.

AB  - We analyze the dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method for measuring the thermal properties of soil or other media. The method involves measuring the temperature rise of a receiver probe that is parallel to, and a known distance from, an emitter probe from which a pulse of heat is released. Under the assumption that the probes are perfect conductors, we derive a semi-analytical solution for this method that accounts for the finite radius and finite conductivity of the probes and contact resistance between probe and soil. The solution in the Laplace domain is obtained by writing solutions of the Helmholtz equation around each probe as infinite series of terms involving Bessel and trigonometric functions. Addition theorems are then used to write the solutions centred at each probe in terms of solutions centred at the other probe. Truncating the series and solving a system of linear equations gives numerical values for the series coefficients, which in turn gives values of the Laplace transforms for numerical inversion. We use the solution to investigate the validity of a simpler approximate solution that is being used in conjunction with the DPHP method for thermal property determination. For what we define as typical implementations of the method, our results show that error resulting from use of the approximate solution is sufficiently small that its effect on estimated thermal properties will be negligible. The same general approach can be used to investigate a growing number of DPHP applications for which the approximate solution may be of questionable accuracy.

AB  - Reasonable ground sampling methods for the development of soil moisture remote sensing retrieval algorithm models and product validation are very important. Soil moisture has obvious variability at different spatial and temporal scales, especially for surface soil moisture. It makes the surface soil moisture sampling at medium or coarse resolution even more challenging. The study reviewed the current common sampling methods and further described the calculation process and limitation in application. Field experiments were carried out in the sampling domain of 165 x 165 m(2) to compare different sampling methods. The results indicated that the corresponding values of necessary sampling size under a standard error of 0.0076 cm(3) cm(-3) (equivalent to relative error = 5 % and confidence level = 95 %) were about 55, 52, 37, 35 and 26 for the conventional statistical sampling, bootstrap sampling, random combination sampling, geo-statistical sampling and stratified sampling, respectively. However, they all required data collection of soil moisture observation in advance to generating an optimal sampling strategy. Even the temporal stability sampling method also needed more numbers of long-term observational data to obtain less representative stable points. When the area of sampling pixels increases in practice, especially when the sub-pixel variation is larger, it is particularly difficult to conduct pre-sampling or real-time sampling at a medium or coarse spatial resolution because of the limited manpower. Therefore, the soil moisture stratified sampling based on vegetation temperature condition index prior knowledge was put forward and applied in the regional scale. With the rapid development of global change research, many kinds of data can become the prior knowledge, including land use data, soil texture data, DEM meteorological data, etc.

AB  - The heat pulse method enables estimation of the thermal diffusivity (k), volumetric heat capacity (C), and thermal conductivity of soils W and soil water content. In this study, analytical solutions were derived by the method of Green's function for a finite pulse cylinder source in a parallelepiped sample of size a by b by c with two kinds of boundary conditions. One is the zero surface temperature (ZST) boundary condition, and the other is the adiabatic boundary condition (ABC). The proposed solutions may be useful for evaluating the errors of a dual-probe heat pulse (DPHP) system introduced by approximating the finite heater with an infinite line source (ILS) model. Applications of the solution are presented in the context of an air-dried virtual soil sample to demonstrate how different factors (boundary conditions, soil sample size, heater needle length and radius, probe spacing, heating duration, and strength) can affect the error in k and C caused by using an ILS model. For a given parallelepiped (or soil column), the larger the ratio of lengths of the heater probe and the sample, the smaller the boundary influence on the temperature rise at the mid-needle temperature sensing location, and the smaller the errors introduced by using the ILS approximation. For various heating strengths, it was found that the errors in both k and C were relatively constant when all other parameters were fixed. These errors increased monotonically and slowly, however, as heat duration increased.

AB  - Impervious, "waterproofed" soil affects both large cities and small towns and causes several problems, with flooding being the most more evident. In the context of impermeability, the application of remote sensing techniques facilitates the identification of prime areas in urban centres that require intervention for flood control. The present work combined radiometric data from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and the Normalized Difference Water Index to identify impermeability models for urban centres and generated two impermeable surface analysis methods: the Surface Waterproofing Index (SWI) and the Urban Surface Waterproofing Index (USWI). The two methods were tested in Corumba and Ladario, urban centres with humid climates and located in the Brazilian Pantanal. Statistically, both methods were considerably successful (>75%), with SWI obtaining better results. The USWI did not perform as well at measuring waterproofing levels, producing results that were more useful for indicating whether an area was impermeable or not.

AB  - Dual probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensors are economical solutions for soil moisture measurements. However, in agriculture fields the temperature significantly changes from time to time during 24 h, which affects response of the soil moisture sensor. This paper, analyzes and models the error produced in the response of the DPHP sensors due to variation of the soil temperature. For this purpose, first effect of the soil temperature on the response of the sensor is studied using eight different soil samples. Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model, used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured for 38 h at every 1 h interval. Field measurements indicates that volumetric moisture content measured without temperature compensation leads to error of about 3% and with temperature compensation the error is reduced to 0.5%.

AB  - With the goal of an effective method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors that can be implemented rapidly, the applicability of a two-point alpha-mixing model was examined for a variety of sensor types. A large number of sensor outputs (X) were taken for four different types of ECH2O soil moisture sensors under varying volumetric water contents (theta) using four test sands with various grain sizes. The two-point alpha-mixing model was fitted to the X-theta data and a fitting parameter, alpha, was determined for each sensor type. Two other widely used sensors, the CS616 and the ThetaProbe ML2x, were also tested using the calibration functions and data provided by the manufacturers, including data for a soil with high electrical conductivity. For the sensors tested in this study, the effects of sensor characteristics were lumped into alpha. The value of alpha was 1.0 to 4.6, generally with high r(2) values. Some of these were as accurate as polynomial models that require a large number of X-theta data. After the alpha value is fitted for a specific sensor type, the two-point alpha-mixing model requires only the measurement of porosity and two extreme X values, i.e., sensor outputs in dry and saturated soils, and does not require soil samples with intermediate water content. Therefore, the two-point alpha-mixing model can be considered as an alternative method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors, especially when porosity is known with small uncertainty such as relatively homogeneous field or laboratory experiments.

AB  - The measurement of soil moisture in agriculture is currently dominated by a small number of sensors, the use of which is greatly limited by their small sampling volume, high cost, need for close soil-sensor contact, and poor performance in saline, vertic and stony soils. This review was undertaken to explore the plethora of novel and emerging soil moisture sensors, and evaluate their potential use in agriculture. The review found that improvements to existing techniques over the last two decades are limited, and largely restricted to frequency domain reflectometry approaches. However, a broad range of new, novel and emerging means of measuring soil moisture were identified including, actively heated fiber optics (AHFO), high capacity tensiometers, paired acoustic / radio / seismic transceiver approaches, microwave-based approaches, radio frequency identification (RFID), hydrogels and seismoelectric approaches. Excitement over this range of potential new technologies is however tempered by the observation that most of these technologies are at early stages of development, and that few of these techniques have been adequately evaluated in situ agricultural soils.

AB  - With growing usage and demand for the global freshwater supply, there is an increasing need for technologies that facilitate water conservation and environmental stewardship in irrigated agriculture. Toward this end, recent demonstrations of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors have revealed the value of wireless soil moisture content sensors. However, existing wireless solutions often employ above-ground wireless communication modules that physically interfere with routine farming operations. Underground wireless network solutions are severely challenged by the large radio-frequency (RF) propagation loss through soil. This paper presents a method that overcomes both problems by employing completely buried underground IoT sensors and communication modules with UAS (uncrewed aircraft system) mounted LoRaWAN gateways. The UAS mounted LoRaWAN gateway eliminates the need for any in-field base stations and also allows the LoRa enabled sensors to transmit data over short distances with very low energy. Field tests were carried out using this approach to serve as a proof of concept. The RSSI (received signal strength indicator) demonstrates that the proposed solution has good communication link margin and a significantly larger communication range than is necessary for reliable operation. Moreover, this solution is easy to build, scalable, cost-effective, and can be implemented in a highly power efficient fashion.

AB  - This study presented a novel method to determine the volume of sensitivity (VOS) for dielectric sensors by frozen soil columns radially thawing from outside inward. The method is based on physical equivalence of the dielectric properties between soil drying-wetting and freezing-thawing transitions. We applied this method to determine/compare (i) the VOSs of two types of fringe field probes (one tube type and one cone type) with sandy silt loam samples at a middle level of soil moisture content (theta(v) = 0.20 cm(3) cm(-3)), (ii) the VOSs of the cone-type probe with sandy silt loam samples at three levels (theta(v) = 0.10, 0.20, and 0.28 cm(3) cm(-3)), and (iii) the VOSs of the tube-type probe with three soil textural samples (sand, sandy silt loam, and silty clay). The determined radii of the cone-type sensor ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 cm and those of the tube-type sensor from 5.1 to 8.5 cm. These results could be beneficial for improving the technical design of soil dielectric sensors and understanding the effect of soil physical properties on the VOS.

AB  - Internet of things (IoT) systems for precision agriculture offer the opportunity for more efficient use of water and fertilizers. Here, capacitive moisture sensors are screen-printed on a fully biodegradable paper substrate infiltrated with cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs). Screen-printed trace quality on the CNF-composite substrate is comparable to traces printed on polyimide and superior to traces printed on conventional cardstock. CNF-composite sensors absorb moisture and are shown to respond to changes in relative humidity (RH) in air. Sensors measured in loamy sand, similar to soil found in midwestern agricultural fields, are shown to respond to changes in soil moisture. The sensors demonstrate fast response times in both air and soil, making them ideal for use in agricultural applications. Small feature sizes achievable through screen-printing on the CNF-composite enable their direct use in 902-928 MHz chipless passive wireless sensing systems, as the fabricated sensors are shown to have a self-resonance well above the operating frequency band.

AB  - The Mississippi River Valley Alluvial Aquifer (MRVAA) is declining at a rapid rate due to withdrawal for agricultural irrigation. This research was conducted to develop a sensor-based irrigation threshold for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) that maximizes net returns and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). The effects of irrigation based on growth stage (full season, emergence to first bloom, first bloom to peak bloom, and peak bloom to first cracked boll) and irrigation threshold (non-irrigated, -50 kPa, -90 kPa, and -130 kPa) on cotton lint yield, net returns above irrigation costs, and IWUE were evaluated on a Leeper silty clay loam (fine, smectitic, nonacid, thermic Vertic Epiaquepts). Net returns above irrigation costs were $142/acre greater when the threshold was maintained at -90 kPa rather than -50 kPa (p < 0.0001). Maintaining the threshold at -90 kPa also increased IWUE at least 61% relative to the -50 and -130 kPa thresholds (p < 0.0001). Neither increasing nor decreasing the threshold as a function of growth stage improved yield relative to a season-long threshold of -90 kPa (p = 0.5460). Our data indicate that yield, net returns above irrigation costs, and IWUE are maximized by maintaining a season-long threshold of -90 kPa. Adoption of this technique could reduce agriculture withdrawal from the MRVAA and thus improve its sustainability.

AB  - The use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation can help reduce water and energy consumption and risks of groundwater contamination, which are essential aspects for pursuing sustainable development goals. However, increased adoption of this technology is limited by calibration requirements, technical complexities, and sensor costs. In this work, a simplified method for reducing the measurement error of a recently released low-cost soil sensor (T-Higrow) is presented. The method only requires measurements of a dry sample from the target soil, which are inputted into a simple correction formula to reduce the measurement error at higher moisture levels. The requirements of the proposed method are simple enough for most labs or extension services. This method was compared to the commonly used linear, polynomial, and logarithmic regression models based on repeated bench-scale experiments within 0%-35% moisture range in silt and sandy loam soils and in silica sand. Uncorrected sensor readings correlated well with soil moisture (r: 0.94-0.98), but with significant overestimation (25%-60% error). The simplified correction method showed comparable error reduction to regression models across all soil types. All methods reduced error down to 2%-10% (0.02-0.1 cm(3) cm(-3)) and maintained high correlations (r > 0.94), except for logarithmic regression which reduced correlation by around 3%. Variability amongst sensor measurements was generally low (Standard Deviation: 0.01-0.03) particularly at moisture ranges below 20%, this was also the case for sensor-to-sensor variability (Standard Deviation: 0.01-0.03). Sensor evaluation and calibration works are needed to increase the accessibility to this technology for improved water and energy conservation.

AB  - Increase in the size of dairy cattle farms in northwest Spain has caused an intensification of forage production and reinforced the need for two crops per year However, in this geographical area, the establishment of the winter crop is not always possible because of the high rainfall and the poor workability of the land. The objective of this study is to evaluate the no-tillage system as a possible solution for these workability problems. Although no-till planting systems have been accepted for many years in some regions, it is relatively new to the area where this study was conducted. Cone index (CI) values under two tillage systems were studied during three consecutive growing seasons (200012001, 200112002, and 200212003). The relationship between the penetration resistance and the soil water content of a sandy loam soil was studied during two consecutive growing seasons (200112002 and 200212003). Conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) were compared in a crop of Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) in rotation with silage corn (Zea mays L.) during four growing seasons. Soil penetration resistance and soil water content were related to soil workability. The results showed higher cone index values under NT than under CT and a good correlation between penetration resistance and soil water content. NT showed a greater ability to bear traffic load and, therefore, an improvement in soil workability throughout the growing season. This improvement was more valuable in autumn at the time of ryegrass drilling, the critical time from the point of view of soil workability. In spite of the higher CI values, dry matter yields of Italian ryegrass were not significantly different under NT than under CT.

AB  - Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) is a key parameter of global energy and water cycle, and knowing its spatiotemporal variability is of key importance in an array of research topics and practical applications alike. Recent developments in Earth Observation (EO) have indicated that SSM can be retrieved from different regions of electromagnetic spectrum, and numerous approaches have been proposed to facilitate this. Herein, are reviewed the SSM retrieval techniques exploiting optical and thermal EO data, including synergistic techniques with other types of EO datasets. The challenges and limitations of EO in this respect are discussed, aiming at providing a roadmap on which future research should be directed. It is also apparent that to satisfy the requirements for SSM information for practical applications, effort should be towards the investigation of the synergistic use of EO systems in deriving SSM for water resources applications.

AB  - The unsustainable use of the soil of the deforested area at the Amazonian border is one of the greatest threats to the rainforest. Among the causes of land degradation in the humid tropics are phosphorus depletion (P), the decrease of soil organic matter (SUM) and the loss of basic cations. The aim of this study was determine the effects of different land uses on the dynamics of soil organic matter and phosphorus, to determine whether and how changes in the P and SUM can be used to assess the degree of land degradation in the humid tropics and whether the use of ecological systems can lessen or mitigate this degradation. Five systems were chosen according to potential use in the region: pasture of 30 years; no-tillage with 5 years of rice-maize rotations; no-tillage in alley cropping systems of 10 years; a newly cleared area; and 20 years of undisturbed secondary forest. Each field was sampled in a "W" pattern, to collect the soil samples from the chosen systems, prior to the chemical analyses. The SUM was separated by physical soil fractionation. The soil P fractionation was performed. All of the soil samples showed a very low pH range. The potential acidity was high under the alley cropping system, with more intensive and continuous use. All of the more labile fractions of organic matter decreased with the continuous use of soil in the alley cropping system. Therefore under alley cropping, most of the P (approximately 95%) was found in an inorganic form, and approximately 60% was found in the less labile fractions. The pasture and secondary forest showed higher contents of the labile fractions of organic matter and organic P. Higher correlations of organic P were found with the silt and clay fractions of organic matter. The results indicate that the fractions of P and organic matter are important indicators to assess changes in the degree of land degradation in the humid tropics. These results indicate also that the intensive and continuous use of annual crops in the soils of the humid tropics must be considered as posing a high risk to the sustainability of the agrosystems, mainly because of the increase of the active and potential acidity, the decrease of the labile organic matter and the depletion of the pools of organic P, leading to land degradation.

AB  - Nitrogen is a vital ingredient for plant development and growth. It is one of the most crucial indicators of soil fertility and crop growth conditions. For the monitoring of nitrogen loss patterns and the development of crop nitrogen fertilizer application strategies, an accurate determination of soil nitrogen concentration can be a valuable source of information. For the advancement of precision agriculture and the preservation of the natural ecological environment, an accurate, quick, and low-cost determination of soil nitrogen content and its variations is essential. This paper systematically analyzes and summarizes soil nitrogen detection methods by compiling and analyzing the relevant literature, comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various methods, and concluding with a discussion of the most significant challenges and future research trends in this field. This study provides a helpful resource for understanding the current status, application constraints, and future developments of nitrogen-sensing technologies in precision agriculture.

AB  - An integrated sensing device for irrigation scheduling (ISDI) was developed to assess the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum for irrigation scheduling. In the present study, a field experiment was carried out to evaluate the performance of ISDI. ISDI was used to determine crop water stress index (CWSI) across various irrigation regimes in wheat crop at the WTC farm, ICAR-IARI, New Delhi, India. The experiment considered were full irrigation (FI) and various deficit irrigation levels (DI-15, DI-30, DI-45, and DI-60), receiving 15, 30, 45, and 60% less water in comparison to FI, respectively. The calibration and performance of the ISDI sensor probes in the field was done with gravimetric methods along with time domain reflectometry (TDR) and a handheld infrared thermometer. The field calibration of the ISDI's soil moisture probe and TDR gave promising results, with R-2 values ranging from 0.76 to 0.81 and 0.81 to 0.86, respectively, for soil depths up to 45 cm. ISDI's infrared sensor probe also demonstrated strong alignment with a handheld infrared thermometer (R-2: 0.95), indicating reliable methods. Furthermore, a regression equation for estimating the lower baseline and upper threshold for CWSI computation was derived as (T-c - T-a)(ll) = 1.97 x VPD - 1.43 with R-2 of 0.86 and 1.93 degrees C, respectively. It was also recommended to initiate irrigation when CWSI was >= 0.35 for wheat to achieve optimal crop yields.

AB  - Watermark, Tensiometer and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) are commonly used soil water sensors in irrigation practice whose performance depends on soil type, depth and growing conditions. Here, the results of sensor performance evaluation in different soil depths as well as the field and laboratory testing in silty clay loamy soil are presented. Gravimetric soil moisture samples were taken from sensor installation depths (10, 20, 30 and 45 cm) and used as reference Soil Water Content (SWC). The measurements varied significantly (p < 0.05) across the monitoring depths. On average across the soil depths, there was a strong negative linear relationship between Watermark (r = -0.91) and TDR (r = 0.94), and a moderate negative (r = -0.75) linear relationship between SWC and Tensiometer. In general, Watermark and Tensiometer measured SWC with great accuracy in the range of readily available water, generated larger Mean Difference (MD) than TDR and overestimated SWC, while TDR underestimated SWC. Overall, laboratory testing reduced the root mean square error (RMSE, Watermark = 1.2, Tensiometer = 2.6, TDR = 1.9) and Mean Average Error (MAE, Watermark = 0.9, Tensiometer = 2.04. TDR = 1.04) for all tested sensors.

AB  - Efficient and cost effective ways of irrigation have emerged as the need of the hour due to limited sweet water resources, especially the countries that are seriously hit by a lack of sweet water reservoirs. The majority of the water is wasted due to inefficient ways of watering plants. In this paper, we propose an intelligent approach for efficient plant irrigation that has a database of daily water needs of a type of plant and decides the amount of water for a plant type on the basis of the current moisture in soil, humidity, and time of the day. This approach not only saves sweet water by efficient utilization, but also supports smart consumption of energy. Our approach employs IoT and a set of sensors to efficiently record plant data and their watering needs and the approach is implemented with a mobile phone application interface that is used to continuously monitor and control the efficient watering system. The results of this study are easy to reproduce as the sensors used are cheap and easy to access. The study discusses in this paper is experimented on small area (such as tunnel farm) but the results of the experiments show that the used approach can be generalized and can be used for large size fields for efficient irrigation. The results of the experiments also outperform the manual approach and the similar approaches for sensor based irrigation systems.

AB  - Rice fallow, a rainfed lowland agro-ecology, is presently gaining particular attention for sustainable cropping intensification in the South Asia. Nevertheless, cropping intensification of rice-fallow areas is largely challenged by non-availability of irrigation, the poor financial status of farmers and soil constraints. Indeed, fast depletion of the soil residual moisture remains the primary obstacle for growing a crop in succession in rice fallows. A field investigation was carried out to identify the most adaptable ricewinter crop rotation and to customize appropriate crop establishment practice for a winter crop that could conserve the soil moisture. Treatments comprised of three crop establishment practices for winter crops [utera (relay cropping, i.e. broadcasting of seeds in standing rice crop 15 days before harvesting), zero tillage (ZT) and ZT with mulching (ZTM)], and five post-rainyseason crops (lentil, chickpea, lathyrus, mustard and linseed). Results showed that lathyrus and lentil could be the potential winter crop in the rice-fallow condition of Eastern India. Except for mustard crop, the productivity of all the winter crops was higher in utera cropping, which was primarily attributed to early crop growth and higher soil moisture content over ZT and ZTM treatments. The higher water use efficiency was recorded under utera cropping over ZT and ZTM treatments. Higher system productivity (system rice equivalent yield) in rice-utera lathyrus (9.3 t ha(-1)) and rice-utera lentil (8.1 t ha(-1)) led to higher net returns and production efficiency over other treatments (winter crop x crop establishment practice). Benefits of rice residue mulching were prominent in lentil, mustard and linseed crop productivity. Energy use efficiency of different crop establishment practices follows the trend of utera > ZT > ZTM (p < 0.05), being highest in rice-utera lathyrus (5.3) followed by rice-utera lentil (4.8) crop rotations. The simulated data shows that winter crops grown under utera led to less emission of greenhouse gas (GHG) and low global warming potential (GWP) as compared to ZT and ZTM treatments. Rice-lathyrus, rice-lentil and rice-chickpea systems had lower N2O emission than rice-mustard and rice-linseed rotations. Hence, lathyrus and lentil could be included in rice fallows ideally with utera for sustainable cropping intensification and improving the farmers' income in Eastern India.

AB  - This study presents spatial statistical methods for examining the distribution of soil moisture in a sub-alpine environment. The high local variability of soil moisture is not well characterized by spatial interpolation from dispersed data points. Interpolation using only field samples from Loch Vale, Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado produced coarse estimates that followed mean soil moisture trends, but failed to capture local mid-slope variation. A properly specified regression model was identified by using dispersed field samples and ancillary data derived from Ikonos-2 and lidar data. This model predicted soil moisture patterns at a much finer spatial resolution. An intensive field campaign provided independent soil moisture measurements that were used to assess the model's accuracy. The modeled soil moisture estimates captured local variability associated with topographic terrain differences along mid-slope areas.

AB  - The need for water conservation continues to increase as global freshwater resources dwindle. Turfgrass mangers are adapting to these concerns by implementing new tools to reduce water consumption. Time-domain reflectometer (TDR) soil moisture sensors can decrease water usage when scheduling irrigation, but nonuniformity across unsampled locations creates irrigation inefficiencies. Remote sensing data have been used to estimate soil moisture stress in turfgrass systems through the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). However, numerous stressors other than moisture constraints impact NDVI values. The water band index (WBI) is an alternative index that uses narrowband, near-infrared light reflectance to estimate moisture limitations within the plant canopy. The green-to-red ratio index (GRI) is a vegetation index that has been proposed as a cheaper alternative to WBI as it can be measured using digital values of visible light instead of relying on more costly hyperspectral reflectance measurements. A replicated 2 x 3 factorial experimental design was used to repeatedly measure turf canopy reflectance and soil moisture over time as soils dried. Pots of '007' creeping bentgrass (CBG) and 'Latitude 36' hybrid bermudagrass (HBG) were grown on three soil textures: United States Golf Association (USGA) 90:10 sand, loam, and clay. Reflectance data were collected hourly between 07:00 and 19:00 using a hyperspectral radiometer and volumetric water content (VWC) data were collected continuously using an embedded soil moisture sensor from soil saturation until complete turf necrosis by drought stress. The WBI had the strongest relationship to VWC (r = 0.62) compared to GRI (r = 0.56) and NDVI (r = 0.47). The WBI and GRI identified significant moisture stress approximately 28 h earlier than NDVI (p = 0.0010). Those metrics also predicted moisture stress prior to fifty percent visual estimation of wilt (p = 0.0317), with lead times of 12 h (WBI) and 9 h (GRI). By contrast, NDVI provided 2 h of prediction time. Nonlinear regression analysis showed that WBI and GRI can be useful for predicting moisture stress of CBG and HBG grown on three different soil textures in a controlled environment.

AB  - Water shortages have increasingly become a global issue due to the acceleration of climate change. The consumption of freshwater can be reduced to a minimum using water irrigation techniques that are based on conservative methods. For example, one of these is precision irrigation, or PI, which uses advanced digital technology to regulate the amount of water used. The aim is to use the least amount of water necessary for a given purpose. This approach keeps consumption to a minimum while the amount remains effective for its purpose. It is also important to note that the variability which occurs in soil and crops will create different types of conditions. These different conditions will need to be studied so as to determine the correct and adequate dynamics for a water management approach that is efficient. In this study, three investigation methods were developed and compared. The first evaluation was performed on outputs from the geoelectric reading of Automatic Resistivity Profiling (ARP). A second evaluation was performed in real time via a sensor network placed in the soil for the duration of two growing seasons of two different crops. The last evaluation was carried out by using maps of spectral indices obtained by the Sentinel 2 satellites. The correlations between the three methods were evaluated to verify if satellite information may have significant potential in the use of water management in varying conditions. From the results obtained, some correlations have been found from the observations of the three systems under study. This has given a positive input towards using satellite maps which are integrated with simplified proximal sensor networks. The outcome of this technique can improve the efficiency of how to manage water distribution on cultivated land.

AB  - The performance of an irrigation system is most often described in terms of its distribution uniformity. The standard procedure for measuring irrigation distribution uniformity does not take into account the spatial variability of water in the soil following irrigation events. This research was initiated to evaluate the irrigation distribution uniformity of golf course irrigation systems and soil moisture distribution uniformity following their application. The lower quarter distribution uniformity (DULQ) at five courses averaged 55 % and ranged from 45 to 63 %. Soil moisture lower quarter distribution uniformity (SMDULQ) was 11 to 20 % higher than irrigation distribution uniformity. Semivariance analysis revealed a strong spatial relationship for irrigation distribution. However, spatial analysis of soil moisture was not consistent with the variability in irrigation delivery. It was concluded that the interaction of soil properties with turfgrass, not irrigation delivery, is the most significant contributing factor to soil moisture uniformity. From this study it was concluded that irrigation distribution should not be the only measure of irrigation system performance when considered in the context of water availability.

AB  - Here we detail an inductively coupled extender (ICE) and resonant (LC) sensor to monitor soil moisture using a portable reader. Significant advances of this ICE-LC design are extending typical LC sensor read range over a meter and reducing positional alignment sensitivity between reader and sensor. An analytical model validates the working principle and feasibility of the ICE-LC system. Prototypes of the ICE-LC sensor were built and optimized in terms of sensitivity and power transfer (single and four turns for ICE top and bottom coils, respectively). Soil moisture tests validated the ICE-LC improvements on minimized positional alignment sensitivity and extended read range, transducing a decrease in resonant frequency with increasing soil moisture. When calibrating with existing wired approaches, the ICE-LC sensor had a reproducible, linear sensor gain of 4.52%moisture content/MHz with an R-2 of 0.745 and RMSE of 2.41%. A smaller, planar form factor of the ICE-LC sensor was also tested and exhibited reduced positional alignment sensitivity between reader and sensor at shorter read ranges. This initial study demonstrates the feasibility of the ICE-LC resonant sensor as a cost-effective method to monitor soil moisture content throughout the growing season at many field locations.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Sensor capability information can be used as a basis for the integrated management of vast and heterogeneous remote sensing sensors in Global Earth Observation System of Systems environment. However, the existing representation of this information shows an inconsistent pattern, incomplete capability aspects, and casual expression forms, resulting in information silos among different systems. A sensor capability representation model (SCRM) is proposed in this study. Based on the Meta Object Facility architecture, a five-tuple hierarchical SCRM framework is formulated. Five specific representation element collections for typical. remote sensing sensor types are developed to satisfy the requirements of detailed capability expression. The Open Geospatial Consortium Sensor Model Language is used as the expression form of the proposed SCRM. A prototype system is developed and a case study is conducted for a soil moisture monitoring application in Baoxie Town. The SCRM can also be extensively utilised for other environmental monitoring and modelling situations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Automated electronic soil moisture sensors, such as time domain reflectometry (TDR) and capacitance probes are being used extensively to monitor and measure soil moisture in a variety of scientific and land management applications. These sensors are often used for a wide range of soil moisture applications such as drought forage prediction or validation of large-scale remote sensing instruments. The convergence of three different research projects facilitated the evaluation and comparison of three commercially available electronic soil moisture probes under field application conditions. The sensors are all installed in shallow soil profiles in a well instrumented small semi-arid shrub covered subwatershed in Southeastern Arizona. The sensors use either a TDR or a capacitance technique; both of which indirectly measure the soil dielectric constant to determine the soil moisture content. Sensors are evaluated over a range of conditions during three seasons comparing responses to natural wetting and drying sequences and using water balance and infiltration simulation models. Each of the sensors responded to the majority of precipitation events; however, they varied greatly in response time and magnitude from each other. Measured profile soil moisture storage compared better to water balance estimates when soil moisture in deeper layers was accounted for in the calculations. No distinct or consistent trend was detected when comparing the responses from the sensors or the infiltration model to individual precipitation events. The results underscore the need to understand how the sensors respond under field application and recognize the limitations of soil moisture sensors and the factors that can affect their accuracy in predicting soil moisture in situ.

AB  - Agriculture being the major user of water resources, accounts for 70% of global freshwater demand. With the rise in demand of clean water, the need to implement more efficient strategies for water management in irrigated agriculture increases. A field study was carried out to produce maize crop at the Water Management Research Center, Postgraduate Agricultural Research Station, University of Agriculture, Faisalabad. Total forty-two (42) indigenized soil moisture sensors (15.24 cm & 30.48 cm long) of copper, brass, and steel were installed for monitoring irrigation efficiency of seven maize production treatments. The indigenized sensors and irrigation system were integrated with Arduino Microcontroller and Raspberry Pi3 for irrigating maize crop. Arduino Mega was coupled with Arduino Ethernet Shield for transformation of soil moisture data on cloud. Drip irrigation treatments (T-6 = 390.8 mm and T-7 = 387.2 mm) required significantly lower mean amount of water than all the other treatments and the flood irrigation treatments (T-1 = 659.6 mm and T-2 = 644.5 mm) required the greatest (alpha = 0.05) amount of mean irrigation depth. Drip irrigation treatments (T-6 and T-7) produced higher mean water productivity values (19.55 and 19.2) than those under flood irrigation treatments (T-1 = 9.2 and T-2 = 9.72) and perforated pipe irrigation treatments (T-3 = 17.3, T-4 = 17.11 and T-5 = 16.38). The mean yield of maize grain over two years was greater under drip irrigation treatments (T-6 = 7634.0 kg/ha and T-7 = 7430.5 kg/ha) than those under flood (T-1 = 6072.8 kg/ha, T-2 = 6263.1 kg/ha) and perforated pipe irrigation treatments (T-3 = 7209.3 kg/ha, T-4 = 7097.6 kg/ha, T-5 = 6793.1 kg/ha). Perforated pipe irrigation treatments had significantly greater (alpha = 0.5) maize grain yield than those under flood irrigation treatments. The indigenized sensors proved to be a viable tool to monitor real time soil moisture at 15.24 cm, 30.48 cm, 60.96 cm and 91.44 cm depth in the root zone for promoting precision irrigation to improve water productivity.

AB  - Soil moisture has high spatial and temporal variability, depending on topography, soil texture, vegetation and meteorological conditions. It influences many processes in the soil and supplies water to the vegetation. This is often a limiting factor in agricultural production.
   Over an 18-month period, we measured soil moisture dynamics down to a depth of 70 cm in a long-term trial in Bolivia comprising six different land-use systems, i.e. cocoa monocultures and agroforestry systems, both under organic and conventional management, successional cocoa agroforestry systems and a natural fallow. Soil was heterogeneous over the area and in depth. We identified and separated two soil groups which differed in both, texture and soil water retention capacity. Considering the two groups, we assessed the effect of the different land-use systems on soil moisture dynamics and plant available water on the one hand, and how different soil moisture conditions affect growth and production of cocoa on the other.
   In monocultures with shallow rooting cocoa only, soil moisture decreased mainly in the uppermost soil layer during the dry season and the lower layers kept more moisture year round. In agroforestry systems soil moisture decreased homogeneously over the soil profile, implying a complementarity in water use of cocoa and deeper rooting trees. The uppermost soil layer in the agroforestry systems had higher soil moisture than in the monoculture, demonstrating the role of shade trees to reduce water loss from top soil by evaporation and transpiration of the cocoa. Even though one soil group had continuously higher water availability than the other group, we did not find an effect on the cocoa yield.
   Cocoa relies on sufficient water supply, but beside information on the precipitation it is important to know the soil structure and soil water retention capacity when discussing water availability for cocoa production and to consider the heterogeneity of the soil even over small area.

AB  - Soil moisture content is a critical parameter in understanding the water movement in soil. A soil moisture sensor is a tool that has been widely used for many years to measure soil moisture levels for their ability to provide nondestructive continuous data from multiple depths. The calibration of the sensor is important in the accuracy of the measurement. The factory-based calibration of the soil moisture sensors is generally developed under limited laboratory conditions, which are not always appropriate for field conditions. Thus, calibration and field validation of the soil moisture sensors for specific soils are needed. The laboratory experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of factory-based calibrated soil moisture sensors. The performance of the soil moisture sensors was evaluated using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Index of Agreement (IA), and Mean Bias Error (MBE). The result shows that the performance of the factory-based calibrated CS616 and EC5 did not meet all the statistical criteria except the CS616 sensor for sand. The correction equations are developed using the laboratory experiment. The validation of correction equations was evaluated in agricultural farmlands. Overall, the correction equations for CS616 and EC5 improved the accuracy in field conditions.

AB  - Meeting the ever-increasing global food, feed, and fiber demands while conserving the quantity and quality of limited agricultural water resources and maintaining the sustainability of irrigated agriculture requires optimizing irrigation management using advanced technologies such as soil moisture sensors. In this study, the performance of five different soil moisture sensors was evaluated for their accuracy in two irrigated cropping systems, one each in central and southwest Oklahoma, with variable levels of soil salinity and clay content. With factory calibrations, three of the sensors had sufficient accuracies at the site with lower levels of salinity and clay, while none of them performed satisfactorily at the site with higher levels of salinity and clay. The study also investigated the performance of different approaches (laboratory, sensor-based, and the Rosetta model) to determine soil moisture thresholds required for irrigation scheduling, i.e., field capacity (FC) and wilting point (WP). The estimated FC and WP by the Rosetta model were closest to the laboratory-measured data using undisturbed soil cores, regardless of the type and number of input parameters used in the Rosetta model. The sensor-based method of ranking the readings resulted in overestimation of FC and WP. Finally, soil moisture depletion, a critical parameter in effective irrigation scheduling, was calculated by combining sensor readings and FC estimates. Ranking-based FC resulted in overestimation of soil moisture depletion, even for accurate sensors at the site with lower levels of salinity and clay.

AB  - Capacitance sensors are widely used to monitor volumetric water content in both field and lab settings due to their low cost, ease of use, and capability of providing continuous measurements. However, these sensors are sensitive to temperature variations. Previous attempts to develop calibration equations that negate thermal effects incorporate many empirical constants that vary based on soil and sensor type. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of temperature on sensor performance and develop an improved calibration equation for a widely used capacitance soil moisture/temperature sensor, the ECH2O 5TM. Small cell experiments were conducted with silica sands for a range of temperatures (20-50 degrees C) and water contents. The 5TM showed a bi-directional response to temperature increases based on the soil water content. Within the temperature range examined, the slope of sensor-reading vs. temperature could be predicted using a linear relationship as a function of actual water content.

AB  - This work describes the development and testing of a large-capacity weighing system for calibration of soil moisture sensors in which the gravimetric method is taken as the standard one. The experiment was conducted at the Laboratorio de Irrigacao e Drenagem, Centro de Ciencias Agrarias e Ambientais da Universidade Federal da Bahia, town of Cruz das Almas (12 degrees 40'S, 39 degrees 30'W), State of Bahia, Brazil. The main component of the system was a 60-kg load cell with a 2-mV/V sensibility when submitted to the maximum load. In the calibration process standard weights of 1, 5, 10 and 20 kg were used during seven loading and unloading cycles. A linear calibration model (r(2) = 0.999) was found and the repeatability, hysteresis, and linearity errors were 0.119%, 0.068%, and 0.009% of full scale (FS). The accuracy limits, which represent the overall performance of the weighing system, were +/- 0.083% of FS. The weighing system, in terms of functionality and performance, were considered to be adequate for calibration of soil moisture sensors, like capacitance probes, with undisturbed soil samples under laboratory conditions. The estimated final cost of the system was US$ 766.00.

AB  - The number of different sensors available for measuring soil water content has increased since the introduction of time domain reflectometry (TDR). In this study the performances of the CS616 (Campbell Scientific, Ltd., Shepshed, UK) sensor and the Aquaflex (Streat Instruments., Ltd, Christchurch, NZ) sensor were compared with TDR using both vertically and horizontally installed sensors. It was found that the CS616 manufacturer's standard calibration needed to be linearly transformed, y = 0.59x + 0.01 (m(3) m(-3)), to obtain accurate measurements a sandy soil with horizontally installed probes. In two different soils the standard calibration performed better, and smaller corrections were found, y = 0.87x - 0.01 for a sandy loam and y = 0.96x - 0.001 (m(3) m(-3)) for a sandy loam with a larger clay content, respectively. The CS616 sensor was most likely affected by electrical conductivity at 1.6 dS m(-1) in the soil solution when measuring in drip-fertigated potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.). In the period of fertigation, the sensor overestimated the soil water content in the sandy soil by 0.01 to 0.11 m(3) m(-3) compared with TDR measurements. The dynamic response of the vertically installed sensor to changes in soil water content was shown to be good, and the sensor may be useful for assessing threshold values in water content for the start and end of irrigation. The performance of the Aquaflex sensor was investigated in the sandy soil only, and the sensor was found to reflect the dynamics of soil water content well. However, the manufacturer's standard calibration underestimated the soil water content in the order of 0.10 m(3) m(-3) and even showed negative values.

AB  - Processing tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) is an economically important vegetable crop in southwestern Ontario. Processing tomato (cultivar H9553) fruit yield and quality were evaluated in field experiments in southwestern Ontario over a three-year period (2008-2010). A split-plot randomized complete block design with four blocks was used in 2008 and 2010. Irrigation types (buried and surface drip) served as the main plots, while four moisture depletion levels constituted the split plots. In 2009, a 2x4 factorial complete randomized block design with four blocks was used, with the same two factors. The moisture treatments represented the lower soil moisture triggers, which initiated irrigation scheduling. Irrigation was terminated for each treatment when field capacity was reached. Continuous soil moisture status over the growing season was monitored with a combination of volumetric and tensiometric sensors. Seven fruit quality parameters were monitored: fruit weight, color, pH, size, firmness, Brix yield, and soluble solids. In each year, the most stressed treatment produced the highest soluble solids (6.0, 4.8, and 5.2 degrees Brix for 2008, 2009, and 2010, respectively). Total and marketable fruit yields ranged from 91.9 to 121.1 Mg ha(-1) and from 91.4 and 119.7 kg ha(-1), respectively. Statistical significance was obtained among treatments and irrigation types in 2008 only. Irrigation water use efficiency was also not statistically significant over the three years. Seasonal irrigation depth ranged from 58 to 196 mm, and statistical significance among the moisture treatments was obtained in 2008 and 2010.

AB  - Newly developed sensors, including the EnviroSCAN capacitance system have the potential to monitor and estimate soil moisture content continuously at various depths. A simple site calibration of the sensors is required to obtain accurate soil water content because these sensors are shipped with a default (uncalibrated) equation to the user Therefore, our research objectives were: 1) to calibrate the EnviroSCAN capacitance system versus soil moisture values estimated by a neutron probe calibrated with gravimetrically measured water contents, then 2) statistically compare the calibrated soil water content results with those estimated by the uncalibrated equation using three years of field data. Both the EnviroSCAN capacitance and the neutron probe were installed in a Warden silt loam soil planted to alfalfa. The average water contents of the soil profile estimated by the EnviroSCAN capacitance was used to develop a site specific calibration equation by comparing the sensors' scaled frequencies for 1998 with the soil water content of the neutron probe. The site calibration equation was then statistically validated using both 1999 and 2000 soil water contents. The statistical analyses indicated that discrepancies existed between soil water contents of the site calibration equation and those estimated by the uncalibrated equation. For instance, the RRMSE values of soil water content produced from the calibrated equation were 7%, 41%, and 40%, compared with uncalibrated RRMSE values of 68%, 59%, and 66%, for 1998, 1999, and 2000, respectively. These results support that the site calibration equation was found to give more accurate estimates of individual values (low RRMSE) of volumetric soil water content compared to those obtained from the uncalibrated equation.

AB  - In this study, the added utility of nonlinear rescaling methods relative to linear methods in the framework of creating a homogenous soil moisture time series has been explored. The performances of 31 linear and nonlinear rescaling methods are evaluated by rescaling the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture datasets to station-basedwatershed average datasets obtained over four United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Agricultural Research Service (ARS) watersheds. The linear methods include first-order linear regression, multiple linear regression, and multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), whereas the nonlinear methods include cumulative distribution function matching (CDF), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), Genetic Programming (GEN), and copula methods. MARS, GEN, SVM, ANN, and the copula methods are also implemented to utilize lagged observations to rescale the datasets. The results of a total of 31 different methods show that the nonlinear methods improve the correlation and error statistics of the rescaled product compared to the linear methods. In general, the method that yielded the best results using training data improved the validation correlations, on average, by 0.063, whereas ELMAN ANN and GEN, using lagged observations methods, yielded correlation improvements of 0.052 and 0.048, respectively. The lagged observations improved the correlations when they were incorporated into rescaling equations in linear and nonlinear fashions, with the nonlinear methods (particularly SVM and GEN but not ANN and copula) benefitting from these lagged observations more than the linear methods. The overall results show that a large majority of the similarities between the LPRM and watershed average datasets are due to linear relations; however, nonlinear relations clearly exist, and the use of nonlinear rescaling methods clearly improves the accuracy of the rescaled product.

AB  - An in situ field test on nine commonly-used soil water sensors was carried out in a sandy loam soil located in the Potato Research Center, Fredericton, NB (Canada) using the gravimetric method as a reference. The results showed that among the tested sensors, regardless of installation depths and soil water regimes, CS615, Trase, and Troxler performed the best with the factory calibrations, with a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 15.78, 16.93, and 17.65%, and a r(2) of 0.75, 0.77, and 0.65, respectively. TRIME, Moisture Point (MP917), and Gopher performed slightly worse with the factory calibrations, with a RRMSE of 45.76, 26.57, and 20.41%, and a r(2) of 0.65, 0.72, and 0.78, respectively, while the Gypsum, WaterMark, and Netafim showed a frequent need for calibration in the application in this region.

AB  - Soil bulk electrical conductivity (BEC) was evaluated alongside soil volumetric water content (VWC) and soil temperature measurements using the HydraProbe (model HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems, Inc.) (hereafter called HP) with accuracy range of BEC <= 0.3 S m-1, and the time domain reflectometry (TDR)-315L Probe (model TDR-315L, Acclima, Inc.) (hereafter called AP) suitable for BEC up to 0.6 S m-1, at 23 stations of the U.S. Climate Reference Network. Previous evaluations revealed inconsistent performance of both sensors in some clay soils using manufacturer-recommended calibrations in converting dielectric permittivity measurements to VWC. Here, we found that hourly values of BEC reached 0.6 S m-1 in high clay content soils and exceeded 2 S m-1 in high saline soils, and these high values of BEC were associated with poor performance and failures of both HP and AP sensors. Large values of BEC occurred in predominantly saturated soils where VWC values reached about 0.5 m3 m-3 for saline soils and about 0.7 m3 m-3 for clay soils, while low magnitudes of BEC were associated with low soil water content and seldomly saturated soils. Low hourly BEC values of less than 0.1 S m-1 were observed in wide variety of soil types, where sensor performance was typically excellent. The most influential factor on BEC was high soil water content conditions. Although dielectric permittivity measurements in estimating the soil water content were sensitive to BEC as some high clay content and high salinity soils increased BEC, the impact of large BEC on dielectric permittivity measurements was smaller in the well-drained top soil layers than in deep soil layers that remained near saturation. Soil temperature had only a small impact on BEC. With high clay content and high salinity, the specific area of clay minerals was also associated with the magnitude of BEC.
   Estimated soil bulk electrical conductivity (BEC) and soil volumetric water content (VWC) at soil depths of 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm were evaluated across 23 US Climate Reference Network stations. The estimation of BEC and VWC was based on the use of the 50 MHz HydraProbe and the Acclima 1 GHz time-domain reflectometry (TDR)-315L. The evaluation suggested that the clay type, specific surface area, clay content, soil salinity, and soil temperature combined to affect how soil BEC increased and decreased with soil water content.

AB  - Soil moisture monitoring networks can provide real-time and accurate soil moisture measurements; however, missing values and the lack of unified measurement depths across different networks impedes soil moisture applications at regional and national scales. Therefore, methods for vertical extrapolation of soil moisture, i. e., using shallow soil moisture measurements to estimate deeper soil moisture, are needed for standardizing measurements to a set of common depths. This study compared three methods, artificial neural network (ANN), linear regression (LR), and exponential filter (ExpF), for vertical extrapolation of soil moisture using data from the Oklahoma Mesonet. Based on our analysis of intra-annual variations in soil moisture, we divided each year into two seasons, warm and cool. Our results demonstrate that all methods perform better in the warm season than in the cool season, especially at deeper depths. The Kling-Gupta efficiency was used to assess the performance of each method. All methods had similar performance for near-surface extrapolation of soil moisture (top 25 cm). Although the accuracy of all models tended to decrease with depth, the ExpF outperformed the other methods at deeper depths. The soil water index (SWI) is preferred over volumetric water content as input to the ExpF. Incorporating air temperature and an antecedent precipitation index into the ANN and LR methods did not significantly improve their accuracy. We demonstrated that both ExpF and general LR can be used for SWI extrapolation at sites where only surface soil moisture data are available. Soil properties may be useful for further improving the accuracy of the general LR method.

AB  - Satellite remote sensing observations have the potential for efficient and reliable mapping of spatial soil moisture distributions. However, soil moisture retrievals from active microwave remote sensing data are typically complex due to inherent difficulty in characterizing interactions among land surface parameters that contribute to the retrieval process. Therefore, adequate physical mathematical descriptions of microwave backscatter interaction with parameters such as land cover, vegetation density, and soil characteristics are not readily available. In such condition, non-parametric models could be used as possible alternative for better understanding the impact of variables in the retrieval process and relating it in the absence of exact formulation. In this study, non-parametric methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic are used to retrieve soil moisture from active microwave remote sensing data. The inclusion of soil characteristics and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from infrared and visible measurement, have significantly improved soil moisture retrievals and reduced root mean square error (RMSE) by around 30% in the retrievals. Soil moisture derived from these methods was compared with ESTAR soil moisture (RMSE similar to 4.0%) and field soil moisture measurements (RMSE similar to 6.5%). Additionally, the study showed that soil moisture retrievals from highly vegetated areas are less accurate than bare soil areas.

AB  - The main objective of the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission over the land surface is to monitor surface soil moisture (SM) from measurements of the microwave emission at L-band. These measurements will be done at many incidence angles and two polarizations. The multiconfiguration system of SMOS provides the possibility to retrieve one or several surface parameters in addition to soil moisture. Such an approach, referred to as N-parameter retrievals (where N is the number of retrieved parameters), could make the retrieval process more efficient. In this study, this possibility was investigated using an experimental dataset acquired over a wheat field. First, a detailed analysis of the attenuation properties of the wheat canopy, a vertical-stem dominated crop, was made. The results showed that the polarization and incidence angle dependence of attenuation was very significant and could be accurately modeled using only two parameters: the optical depth tau at nadir (tau(theta = 0)) and a polarization parameter (C(pol)). The need for this latter parameter results from the difference in the dielectric properties of wheat for the vertical and horizontal polarizations. Based on these results, a detailed comparison of different soil moisture retrieval approaches was made. One-, two-, and three-parameter retrieval approaches were tested. In this latter method, soil moisture and the two vegetation parameters (tau(theta = 0) and C(pol)) were retrieved simultaneously. This method was found to be the most efficient: it provided the best accuracy in the SM retrievals and it did not require ancillary information on the vegetation characteristics, which cannot be easily estimated for operational SM mapping applications.

AB  - Large-area soil moisture (SM) data with high resolution and precision are the foundation for the research and application of hydrological and meteorological models, water resource evaluation, agricultural management, and warning of geological disasters. It is still challenging to downscale SM products in complex terrains that require fine spatial details. In this study, SM data from the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) satellite were downscaled from 36 to 1 km in the summer and autumn of 2017 in Sichuan Province, China. Genetic-algorithm-optimized backpropagation (GABP) neural network, random forest, and convolutional neural network were applied. A fusion model between SM and longitude, latitude, elevation, slope, aspect, land-cover type, land surface temperature, normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, evapotranspiration, day sequence, and AM/PM was established. After downscaling, the in situ information was fused through a geographical analysis combined with a spatial interpolation to improve the quality of the downscaled SM. The comparative results show that in complex terrains, the GABP neural network better captures the soil moisture variations in both time and space domains. The GDA_Kriging method is able to merge in situ information in the downscaled SM while simultaneously maintaining the dynamic range and spatial details.

AB  - Water infiltration through a dike model under controlled flooding and drainage conditions was investigated using the gravimetric soil water sampling technique and electromagnetic techniques, in particular ground penetrating radar (GPR) applied in different forms, time domain reflectometry with intelligent microelements (TRIME-TDR) and spatial-time domain reflectometry (S-TDR). The experiments were conducted on the model in two phases. In the first phase, the model was flooded with varying water levels between 0 and 1.25 m above the waterproof base of the model. In the second phase, the characteristics of the temporal water content changes were investigated over a period of 65 days as the flood water drained off from the 1.25 m level. The dike model was constructed with soil of the texture class loamy sand. The aim of the experiment was to investigate whether GPR-based invasive and non-invasive methods were able to quantitatively observe and correctly monitor temporal changes in the volumetric water content (VWC) within embankment dams. The VWC values from the various techniques corresponded very well, especially with low VWC values. A comparison with the VWC of gravimetric soil water sampling showed a satisfactory reproducibility. Characteristic discrepancies were recorded with higher values of the VWC. Under saturated conditions only the invasive methods were able to produce reasonable values of the VWC. After the release of the highest flood level, the drainage phase could be characterized by two invasive methods based on the TDR and GPR techniques.

AB  - The strength of unsaturated soil is defined by the soil water retention behavior and soil suction acting inside the soil matrix. In order to obtain the suction and moisture profile in the vadose zone, specific measuring techniques are needed. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) conventionally measures moisture at individual points only. Therefore, spatial time domain reflectometry (spatial TDR) was developed for characterizing the moisture content profile along the unsaturated soil strata. This paper introduces an experimental set-up used for measuring dynamic moisture profiles with high spatial and temporal resolution. The moisture measurement method is based on inverse modeling the telegraph equation with a capacitance model of soil/sensor environment using an optimization technique. With the addition of point-wise soil suction measurement using tensiometers, the soil water retention curve (SWRC) can be derived in the transient flow condition instead of the static or steady-state condition usually applied for conventional testing methodologies. The experiment was successfully set up and conducted with thorough validations to demonstrate the functionalities in terms of detecting dynamic moisture profiles, dynamic soil suction, and outflow seepage flux under transient flow condition. Furthermore, some TDR measurements are presented with a discussion referring to the inverse analysis of TDR traces for extracting the dielectric properties of soil. The detected static SWRC is finally compared to the static SWRC measured by the conventional method. The preliminary outcomes underpin the success of applying the spatial TDR technique and also demonstrate several advantages of this platform for investigating the unsaturated soil seepage issue under transient flow conditions.

AB  - Increased phosphorus availability in the topsoil layer of no-tillage systems can lead to a higher transformation from inorganic into organic phosphorus fractions of different labilities. The preferential phosphorus accumulation forms and fractions under the application of soluble phosphate rates in a no-tillage system were determined. During five and a half years, the following accumulated P2O5 rates: 0, 130, 180, 260, 360, 540, 720, 980, and 1.240 kg ha(-1) of P2O5, were applied in the winter and/or summer, whereupon samples of the 0-10 cm layer of a clayey Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol) were collected. Total, organic, inorganic, and microbial phosphorus, as well as six inorganic and three organic phosphorus fractions were determined in a decreasing lability sequence. The observed alterations in the total phosphorus content under phosphate addition were restricted to the inorganic fractions. The moderately labile fraction was the major sink for the applied phosphorus. The importance of labile phosphorus fractions increased in direct relation to the phosphate application rates. Labile and moderately labile organic phosphorus fractions in the soil were as important as the respective inorganic fractions, especially under low phosphate application rates.

AB  - Agroforestry systems can fully exploit the ecological benefits of an ecosystem's component plants, and improve the ecological environment, soil quality, and land use efficiency, all of which have recently attracted the attention of many scholars. Southwest China's karst graben basins have barren soil that needs immediate improvement. The karst graben basin in southwest China was used for this study to examine the impacts of several forest-grass composite systems of Bingtang orange-alfalfa-ryegrass on soil improvement, which is located in Jianshui County, Honghe Prefecture, Yunnan Province. The experiment had four treatments, Bingtang orange-alfalfa sowing (B2), Bingtang orange-ryegrass x alfalfa mixed sowing (A), Bingtang orange-ryegrass x alfalfa intercropping (R), and Bingtang orange monocropping (CK). The results showed that different forest-grass composite patterns had noticeable effects on improving the soil's organic carbon (SOC), total nutrients, and available nutrients, especially in the rainy season when plants grew vigorously. Forage grass intercropping under forest exerted the best effect on soil improvement in the surface layer, and the effect decreased with the increase in soil depth. Alfalfa intercropping under Bingtang orange forest had the strongest effect on improving SOC, total N, ammonia nitrogen, and nitrate nitrogen, whose content increased by 30.7%, 27.3%, 35%, and 36.3%, respectively, in the dry season and 38%, 46.7%, 48.7%, and 55.3%, in the rainy season. However, the effect of alfalfa-ryegrass intercropping under the Bingtang orange forest on soil total P, total K, and available P was better than that of the Bingtang orange-alfalfa intercropping system. The C:N ratio is more suitable in the Bingtang orange-ryegrass-alfalfa composite system. Forage grass intercropping under the Bingtang orange forest effectively improved the soil NPK and C status, and the results of this study provided a basis for the selection of forest-grass composite patterns for soil improvement.

AB  - Satellite-based triangle models for evapotranspiration estimation are unique in interpreting the relationship between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)/factional vegetation cover (f(c)) and surface radiative temperature (T-rad) across large heterogeneous areas. However, output and performance of triangle models may depend on the size of the domain being studied and resolution of the satellite images being used. The objective of this study was to assess domain and resolution dependencies of triangle models using progressively larger domains and Landsat Thematic Mapper/Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer sensors at the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment site in central Iowa on days of year 174 and 182 in 2002. Results show domain and resolution dependencies of the triangle models with large uncertainties in evaporative fraction (EF) estimates in terms of a mean absolute percentage difference (MAPD) up to similar to 50%. A trapezoid model which requires derivation of theoretical limiting edges of the NDVI-T-rad space is proposed to constrain domain and resolution dependencies of triangle models. The theoretical warm edge can be derived by solving for temperatures of the driest bare surface and the fully vegetated surface with the largest water stress implicit in both radiation budget and energy balance equations. Areal average air temperature can be taken as the theoretical cold edge. The triangle model appears to perform well across large areas (similar to 10(4) km(2)) but fails to predict EF over small areas (similar to 10(2) km(2)). The trapezoid model can effectively reduce domain and resolution dependencies and constrain errors of the EF estimates with an MAPD of similar to 10%.

AB  - In the context of intensified climate change, approximately 70% of global cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) production is in arid or high temperature environments. Improving cultivation practices is an effective measure to promote the adaptation of cotton production to the climate. To comprehensively study the characteristics of the hydrothermal microclimate in cotton fields and their relationship with cotton biomass and yield formation, a grid sampling method based on sensors with high spatiotemporal resolution was used in this study to monitor the soil temperature and soil moisture under three cropping patterns (monoculture cotton (MC), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/delayed intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (WDC)). The cropping patterns substantially changed the cotton hydrothermal resource utilization. WDC was the pattern with low cotton yield and low hydrothermal resource use efficiency, while MC and WIC were the patterns with high cotton yield and high accumulated temperature production efficiency. Cotton yield exhibited a very significant positive correlation with the accumulated temperature production efficiency of air and soil, and these relationships were less affected by different planting patterns. The climate in 2016 was relatively humid, and the water consumption (WC) of MC was mainly concentrated within a soil depth of 70 cm, WIC was 50 cm, and WDC was 30 cm. The climate in 2017 was relatively dry, and the main soil depth ranges of WC in MC, WIC, and WDC were 50, 30, and 20 cm, respectively. WC was the most important factor affecting cotton biomass, especially reproductive organ biomass, followed by the effective accumulated air temperature. The WC of cotton was most affected by changes in soil moisture at a depth of 30 cm. This study strengthens the application of smart agricultural technology in sustainable cotton production and highlights the complexity of crop responses to cultivation practices and multiple environmental factors.

AB  - Soil moisture and pH levels directly affect urban tree performance. An accurate sensor to assess these soil conditions would allow arborists and urban foresters to make and evaluate management actions. These actions may then be used to improve tree species diversity and site quality. Toward this goal, twenty-one soil pH and moisture sensors were tested for their ability to accurately and precisely measure soil pH, volumetric soil moisture content (VMC), or both. This research was conducted on four different soil texture classes (loamy sand, sandy loam, clay loam, and clay) at three different moisture levels (air dry, approximate to 0.5 field capacity, and field capacity). Soil pH sensors using a glass-electrode in a 1:2 (soil:deionized water) solution were found to accurately and precisely measure soil pH (P = < 0.0001; rho(c) = > 0.95). However, sensors using metal electrodes inserted into the soil had no significant correlation to soil pH levels (P = > 0.1; rho(c) = < 0.2). When selecting a soil pH sensor, measurement method may be the most important consideration. Soil VMC sensors using time domain reflectometry and frequency domain reflectometry methods performed best (P = < 0.0001; rho(c) = > 0.76). Sensors using the electrical conductivity method were highly variable in cost, accuracy, and precision. Future work on these sensors may include field performance evaluations as well as management implications for urban sites.

AB  - Subsurface conditions can be non-intrusively mapped by observing and grouping patterns of similarity within ground-penetrating radar (GPR) profiles. We have observed that the intricate and often visually indiscernible textural variability found within a complex GPR image possesses important parameters that help delineate regions of similar subsurface characteristics. In this study, we therefore examined the feasibility of using textural features extracted from GPR data to automate subsurface characterization. The textural features were matched to a "fingerprint " database of previous subsurface classifications of GPR textural features and the corresponding physical probings of subsurface conditions. Four textural features (energy, contrast, entropy, and homogeneity) were selected as inputs into a neural-network classifier This classifier was tested and verified using GPR data obtained from two distinctly different field sites. The first data set contained features that indicate the presence or lack of sandstone bedrock in the upper 2 in of a shallow soil profile of fine sandy loam and loam. The second data set contained columnar patterns that correspond to the presence or the lack of vertical preferential flow paths within a deep loessial soil. The classifier automatically grouped each data set into one of the two categories. Comparing the results of classification using extracted textural features to the results obtained by visual interpretation found 93.6% of the sections that lack sandstone bedrock correctly classified in the first set of data, and 90% of the sections that contain pronounced columnar patterns correctly classified in the second set of data. The classified profile sections were mapped using integrated GPR and GPS data to show ground surface boundaries of different subsurface conditions. These results indicate that textural features extracted from GPR data can be utilized as inputs in a neural network classifier to rapidly characterize and map the subsurface into categories associated with known conditions with acceptable levels of accuracy. This approach of GPR imagery classification is to be considered as an alternative method to traditional human interpretation only in the classification of voluminous data sets, wherein the extensive time requirement would make the traditional human interpretation impractical.

AB  - There is a growing demand for innovation in the sugarcane production chain to increase crop productivity. The recent use of sugarcane plantlets to improve planting efficiency in the field is a viable option, and nurseries are seeking for enhanced irrigation systems to accelerate the production of high-quality plantlets and optimize water and fertilizer inputs. This research aimed to determine the adequate substrate volumetric water content (VWC) to produce pre-sprouted sugarcane plantlets using ebb-and-flow subirrigation automated by soil moisture sensors and the effects on plant growth in greenhouse on acclimation stages #1 and #2. We tested three thresholds to trigger subirrigation automatically when sensor readings dropped below the setpoints: VWC 45% (v/v), VWC 35%, and VWC 25%. Plantlets were cultivated in 54-cell flat trays with 130-cm(3) cone-shaped containers filled with commercial substrate in ebb-and-flow benches controlled by capacitive soil moisture sensors connected to a datalogger. The results indicated the automated subirrigation system worked properly, successfully irrigating the plantlets based on the target VWC. VWC 35% was the most efficient treatment, reducing fertilizer solution consumption in 44.78% (368.47 L and 2.41 mm d(-1)) in comparison with VWC 45% (667.28 L and 4.37 mm d(-1)) and increasing water use efficiency in 43.18% (7.62 g L-1) when compared to VWC 45% (4.33 g L-1), which produced less biomass with the same amount of water. VWC 45% treatment also resulted in the highest number of irrigation events, with the greatest electrical conductivity value in the substrate at the end of the experiment. All plant growth variables such as stem diameter, plant height, first ligule height, and shoot and root dry weight responded positively to the increase in VWC (P < 0.05). VWC 45% resulted in the highest biomass except root dry weight where VWC 35% was superior. VWC 35% was statistically the same to VWC 45% in all biometric responses (P < 0.05) and showed the best efficiency rate in fertilizer solution consumption and water use. Based on our results, we recommended VWC 35% as the setpoint for water management to produce pre-sprouted plantlets using automated ebb-and-flow subirrigation.

AB  - Methods available to measure salinity and moisture content in arid and semi-arid regions are limited because of the high salinities and very wide range of water contents (i.e. from saturation near the water table to air dry in the evaporation front). This paper is focused on the instrumentation employed in monitoring salt and moisture profiles in a column study which has wide applicability in salinity research. Experiments were conducted in a specially designed evaporation chamber which provided high evaporative demand as experienced in arid and semi-arid regions. Intensively instrumented soil columns with a constant shallow saline water table were used. Moisture content was measured by thermal conductivity and salinity by 4-electrode probe. In each case, insruments were manufactured specifically for the purpose in order to provide the desired degree of spatial resolution. Two soil types, sandy loam and clay loam, were used. Results indicated that thermal-conductivity probes measured water content over a wide range from saturation to 0.16 m(3)/m(3) for clay loam and to 0.09 m(3)/m(3) for sandy loam soil with great sensitivity (R-2 > 0.95) and were unaffected by salt accumulation. The 4-electrode probes provided reliable measurements (R-2 > 0.95) of the salinity of the soil solution for the range relevant to agricultural application. However, the accuracy of the probe decreased with the decreases in the water content after permanent wilting point.

AB  - Site-specific irrigation decisions require information about variations in soil moisture within the active rooting depth of the crop. Producers have been using soil moisture sensors to make irrigation decisions, and soil moisture sensors have been shown to help reduce water usage without reducing yields. There are still unanswered questions on improving efficiency with soil moisture sensors based on density and location of sensors within a field. This three-year study used sensors to evaluate the spatio-temporal variability of soil moisture across an 18 -ha production field in a corn/soybean rotation. A 55 m by 55 m grid was laid on the field, resulting in 44 sampling points that fell either underneath the center-pivot irrigation or the end gun. At each point location, two Watermark granular matrix sensors were installed at depths of 31 and 61 cm for 2018 and 2020 and an addi-tional 76 - cm sensor in 2019. Analysis of soil samples collected in year one revealed fairly homogeneous soils across the field with silty clay loam as the major soil type and only eight percent silt loam. Plant height and leaf area index (LAI) were measured weekly at each of the 44 sampling points. Inverse distance weighted (IDW) interpolation methods were used to predict soil water tension (SWT) values for locations between known points and aid in sensor density and placement within the field. Linear regression was used to model the relationship of LAI and plant height with soil matric potential to find surrogate methods for predicting SWT. The IDW results show that when uniform irrigation applications are made to the field, fewer sensors that are placed in better locations throughout the field can be as useful as a densely gridded array of sensors. Results showed that, while not strong, plant height had a better relationship to SWT than LAI.

AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) involves the management of agricultural fields including spatial information of soil properties derived from apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements. While this approach is gaining much attention in agricultural management, farmed podzolic soils are under-represented in the relevant literature. This study: (i) established the relationship between ECa and soil moisture content (SMC) measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR); and (ii) evaluated the estimated SMC with ECa measurements obtained with two electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors, i.e., multi-coil and multi-frequency, using TDR measured SMC. Measurements were taken on several plots at Pynn's Brook Research Station, Pasadena, Newfoundland, Canada. The means of ECa measurements were calculated for the same sampling location in each plot. The linear regression models generated for SMC using the CMD-MINIEXPLORER were statistically significant with the highest R-2 of 0.79 and the lowest RMSE (root mean square error) of 0.015 m(3) m(-3) but were not significant for GEM-2 with the lowest R-2 of 0.17 and RMSE of 0.045 m(3) m(-3); this was due to the difference in the depth of investigation between the two EMI sensors. The validation of the SMC regression models for the two EMI sensors produced the highest R-2 = 0.54 with the lowest RMSE prediction = 0.031 m(3) m(-3) given by CMD-MINIEXPLORER. The result demonstrated that the CMD-MINIEXPLORER based measurements better predicted shallow SMC, while deeper SMC was better predicted by GEM-2 measurements. In addition, the ECa measurements obtained through either multi-coil or multi-frequency sensors have the potential to be successfully employed for SMC mapping at the field scale.

AB  - Interest in electronic monitoring of soil water has grown as increased demand for water creates a greater need for effective water management. Relatively inexpensive commercial soil water sensors that use measured soil dielectric properties to calculate soil water content have been developed to address this need but have received little independent testing of critical calibration procedures and parameters. The WET sensor (Delta-T Devices, Cambridge, UK) is one such sensor. The two primary objectives in this study were to: (i) determine appropriate calibration parameters for a variety of inorganic soils and organic media; and (ii) determine how WET sensor readings are affected in media with strongly contrasting water contents. We found that the two-point calibrations suggested by the manufacturer yielded parameters that were not significantly different (alpha = 0.05) from those suggested by the manufacturer and yielded values consistent with well-established oven-dry values. For the organic media, we found that accurate, media-specific calibration could be obtained for all media tested and that the general form of the calibration equation used for soils applies to organic media. Experiments in a variety of layered media showed that, in contrast to time domain reflectometry results, the WET-measured dielectric value is the arithmetic average of the two contrasting layers. In soils, the linear correlation between measured and arithmetic average dielectric constants was very high (R-2 > 0.99) for all four soils tested. This indicates that the upward infiltration calibration technique is generally inappropriate for the WET sensor.

AB  - Methods to retrieve surface soil moisture were assessed at the global scale for one entire year by using simulated Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity brightness temperatures (T-B) and vegetation coverage information which can be derived from optical sensors. The global T-B database consists of half-degree continental pixels and accounts for within-pixel heterogeneity, based on 1-km resolution land cover maps. The retrievals were performed by using a three-parameter inversion method applied to the L-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere model. By using a Bayesian approach, vegetation data were injected as a priori information. Two options were investigated to profit from normalized difference vegetation index products: providing an a priori knowledge either on vegetation optical depth or on the vegetation cover fraction (f(cover)). The latter option allows for a better description of the surface heterogeneity by considering a bare soil fraction. When an error of 1 K is applied to the T-B, both synergistic schemes significantly improved the soil moisture accuracy compared with methods using microwave data only. Using the vegetation a priori information, about 80% of the pixels present soil moisture retrieval accuracy less than 0.04 m(3) . m(-3) in terms of root-mean-square error, whereas methods based only on the microwave data provide 63% of pixels of the studied area with this accuracy. If the error in T-B is larger (2 or 3 K), the soil moisture retrieval accuracy decreases significantly for both methods. The use of optical data to give a priori value of vegetation optical option is then the best for these cases.

AB  - This study aims to assess the effectiveness of PCB-based capacitive soil moisture sensors for local field conditions. The electrical scheme of designed sensors has been presented in this study. The PCB-based capacitive soil moisture sensors are calibrated using a linear equation developed between analog values of capacitive sensors and soil moisture content measured from the gravimetric method. The performance of the designed soil moisture sensors was assessed at five different locations at varying depths (i.e., 15 cm, 30 cm, and 45 cm). The calibration results indicated a positive correlation between the soil moisture content and measurement frequency of the sensor for wheat crop, with R2 values of 0.72, 0.83, and 0.83 for 15 cm, 30 cm, and 45 cm depths, respectively. Results reveal that 85% of the sensors accurately detected the patterns in soil moisture fluctuations during the cropping period. The designed capacitive sensors demonstrated a maximum relative error of 5.87% for 45 cm depth. However, the relative error remained below 5% for the 15 cm and 30 cm soil depths. For the sugarcane crop, R2 values vary from 0.66 to 0.82, with the highest relative error of 5.22% at a 15 cm depth. These sensors offer a highly cost-effective solution for farmers, with the entire wireless sensor network system including one sensor node, three soil moisture sensors, and one soil temperature sensor, which is priced at approximately $150, making it a practical and affordable option for widespread adoption.

AB  - The use of irrigation is essential to increase crop productivity; however, for efficient water management, it is necessary to more accurately estimate soil moisture. For this reason, the objective in this work was to calibrate FDR model 10HS frequency domain reflectometry sensors (Decagon Devices) for use in a Geric Xanthic Ferralsol type soil. For the calibration, non disturbed soil samples were collected in PVC pipes at two depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm), with four repetitions each and they were placed in trays with distilled water until saturation. Subsequently the sensors were introduced in the sample to obtain the moisture at the saturation point. Then, the samples were placed in an oven at 60 degrees C, until they reached approximately 10 % humidity. The results showed that the gross volumetric moisture data recorded before calibration did not coincide with the 1:1 line, presenting divergent behavior, thus demonstrating the need for calibration. According to the results, it is concluded that the equations generated with the data before the calibration overestimated the volumetric soil moisture, and the equations obtained after the calibration satisfactorily measure the moisture of the Geric Xanthic Ferralsol type soil.

AB  - The four-year trial was conducted in north-western Slavonia (main arable crop producing region in Croatia) to evaluate the effects of different tillage systems on the water content of silty loam soil (Albic Luvisol) and yields of maize (Zea mays L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The tillage systems compared were: conventional tillage; reduced conventional tillage; conservation tillage I; conservation tillage II (CM); no-tillage (NT). During the study period, there were one dry, two wet and one average season. Soil water content (SWC) was measured at 0-5, 15-20 and 30-35 cm depths on a monthly basis. Tillage systems had significant (P < 0.05) effects on SWC and yields. The highest average SWC in all seasons was measured under the NT system, followed by the CM system. In the second season, the highest yield was measured under the NT system while in all other seasons, it was under the CM system.

AB  - Accurate determination of soil water contents (SWC) is crucially important in many scientific fields, particularly in agriculture. In this study, the performance of conventional FDR MI2X and New WiTu Technology water sensors was statistically evaluated under the impact of changing vegetative cover type (corn and weeds). A three replicated randomized complete block design (RCBD) field experiment was conducted from late April to August, 2019. The spring corn Nongda- 1505 variety was planted and the field was left unsown to allow weeds to grow. To determine the SWC, six WiTu Technology sensors were installed in the middle of each plot. For FDR sensor measurements, PVC tubes were inserted at 30 cm distance from WiTu sensors and soil samples from the 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm depths were taken using soil sampling auger for measurement of gravimetric water content. Both FDR and new Technology of WiTu sensors showed varied performance as soil depth increased from the top layer to deep layer. FDR efficiency was significantly high at the topsoil layer (0-20 cm) with an average accuracy level of 98.01% and reduced in the middle soil layer to 91.78%, then increased to 95.13% in the deep soil layer. While, the average accuracy of the WiTu Technology sensor ranged 98.24%, 95.85% and 92.02% for top, middle and deep soil layers, respectively, these results demonstrate that the soil water detection ability of WiTu Technology is high at the soil depth of 0-40 cm, whereas FDR's ability to detect SWC changes is satisfactory in top to deep layers and low in the middle layer. Furthermore, the FDR showed good consistency with WiTu in all soil layers of the corn field, but there was a larger error for the weed field, which indicated a huge difference in the data measured by FDR and WiTu Technology. The SWC estimation of FDR and WiTu technology more fluctuated with changing vegetation cover type. Thus, the findings of this study provide an opportunity to further study on FDR MI2X and New WiTu Technology sensors for deep-rooted crops under the soil and climatic conditions of Zhengzhou, China.

AB  - A sequential model is developed to disaggregate microwave-derived soil moisture from 40 km to 4 km resolution using MODIS (Moderate Imaging Spectroradiometer) data and subsequently from 4 km to 500 m resolution using ASTER (Advanced Scanning Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data. The 1 km resolution airborne data collected during the three-week National Airborne Field Experiment 2006 (NAFE'06) are used to simulate the 40 km pixels, and a thermal-based disaggregation algorithm is applied using 1 km resolution MODIS and 100 m resolution ASTER data. The downscaled soil moisture data are subsequently evaluated using a combination of airborne and in situ soil moisture measurements. A key step in the procedure is to identify an optimal downscaling resolution in terms of disaggregation accuracy and sub-pixel soil moisture variability. Very consistent optimal downscaling resolutions are obtained for MODIS aboard Terra, MODIS aboard Aqua and ASTER, which are 4 to 5 times the thermal sensor resolution. The root mean square error between the 500 m resolution sequentially disaggregated and ground-measured soil moisture is 0.062 vol./vol. with a bias of -0.045 vol./vol. and values ranging from 0.08 to 0.40 vol./vol.

AB  - We analyse heat paths of a packaged Dual-Probe-Heat-Pulse (DPHP) soil-moisture sensor to improve the sensor's performance at higher levels of volumetric water content. A DPHP sensor consists of heater and temperature probes protruding out into the soil from a casing. The two probes help estimate the soil moisture content by assessing the heat conduction through the soil in the intervening space between them. At lower soil-moisture conditions, the heat conduction through soil dominates whereas at higher soil-moisture contents heat flow through soil decreases due to the increase in volumetric heat capacity and specific heat. Inappropriate placement of the heater element could lead to erroneous measurement due to the heat conduction to the temperature probe through the casing material and the epoxy adhesive inside the casing. To study the heat flow in DPHP sensors, and to develop an improved design, thermal paths in the DPHP sensors having different heater element positions were first analysed through Finite Element Analysis. A Lumped Element Model was also developed to further examine the heat paths in the DPHP sensor and suggest design modifications. The trend exhibited by the lumped model corroborates the results of Finite Element Analysis. Laboratory experiments were performed with DPHP sensors having different heater element positions, results of which validated the modeling outcomes. The insights gained in this study would serve as the design guidelines for manufacturing DPHP soil-moisture sensors with improved accuracy at minimal power consumption. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The existing study aimed to assess four soil moisture sensors' capacitive (WH51 and SKU: SEN0193) and resistive (Yl69 and IC Station) abilities, which are affordable and medium-priced for their accuracy in six common soil types in the central region of Iraq. The readings' calibration for the soil moisture sensor devices continued through two gravimetric methods. The first depended on the protocols' database, while the second was the traditional calibration method. The second method recorded the lowest analysis error compared with the first. The moderate -cost sensor WH51 showed the lowest standard error (SE), MAD, and RMSE and the highest R2 in both methods. The performance accuracy of WH51 was close to readings shown by the manufacturing company (1%), as the MAD amounted to 1.62%. Through both methods, the average MAD for sensors ranged from 4.76% to 7.36%, with this result considered acceptable, especially for low-cost sensors with insufficient available information for accuracy. In general, the average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) for all sensors was 25.54%, which means that the validity of the measurement for the low-cost sensors reached 75%. It encourages their use by plant breeders in irrigation, as the error rate was less than the specified depletion of 50% for available water in irrigation, where all study textures showed that the sensor reading reached the limits of 72 (+/- 2), adopting 3% MAD for all sensors. The study affirms that, except for the IC station sensor recommended for irrigation use only in sandy -sandy loam soils, low-cost sensors have suitable accuracy for irrigation management.

AB  - The basic need common to all living beings is water. Less than 1% of the water on earth is fresh water and water use is increasing daily. Agricultural practices alone require huge amounts of water. The drip technique improved the efficiency of water use in irrigation and initiated the introduction and development of fertigation, the integrated distribution of water and fertilizer. The past few decades have seen extensive research being carried out in the area of development and evaluation of different technologies available to estimate/measure soil moisture to aid in various applications and to facilitate the use of drip irrigation for users and farmers. In this technology, plant moisture and temperature are accurately monitored and controlled in real time over roots in the form of droplets, by developing smart monitoring system to save water and avoid water waste using drip irrigation technology. Water is delivered to the roots drop by drop, which saves water as well as prevents plants from being flooded and decaying due to excess water released by irrigation methods such as flood irrigation, border irrigation, furrow irrigation, and control basin irrigation. Drip irrigation with an embedded intelligent monitoring system is one of the most valuable techniques used to save water and farmers' time and energy. In this paper, we design an embedded monitoring system based in the integrated 65 nm CMOS technology in agricultural practices which would facilitate agriculture and enable farmers to monitor crops. Hence, to demonstrate the feasibility, a prototype was constructed and simulated with modelsim and validated with nclaunch the both tools from Cadence, as well as implementation on the FPGA board, was be performed.

AB  - Hydrological modeling has become a common approach for the design of stormwater management strategies, which increasingly rely on permeable and decentralized systems in order to mitigate the impacts of urbanization. In most applications, little attention is paid to the temporal variability of infiltration fluxes resulting from soil moisture redistribution between rain events. In this paper, a conceptual infiltration-redistribution model is introduced to investigate the importance of the description of infiltration fluxes for the modeling of sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS). The model was first verified against the numerical solution of the Richards equation. Performance indicators simulated with the model for a large range of infiltration scenarios were then compared to those obtained using simpler approaches commonly used in urban hydrology. The model was shown to replicate, at a low computational cost, numerical solutions of the Richards equation. Regarding SUDS modeling, the results indicated that a correct description of the temporal variability of infiltration fluxes (1) may be needed for some configurations in order to assess long-term volume-reduction efficiencies, and (2) is more generally required when examining frequency-based performance indicators.

AB  - Water-saving irrigation methods have been increasingly used for vegetable cultivation in greenhouse or plastic film house. However, there is limited information concerning the effect of water-saving irrigation methods on soil phosphorus (P) behavior. In this experiment, drip and subsurface irrigation methods were applied, with furrow irrigation method as control, in Mollic Gleysols. Soil P distribution throughout the depth was significantly affected by irrigation methods. Total, Olsen, organic and inorganic P contents were greater in the topsoil (0-10 and 10-20 cm) than in the subsoil (20-30, 30-40, 40-50 and 50-60 cm). The Olsen P content throughout 0-60 cm layer under drip and subsurface irrigation treatments was lower than that under the furrow irrigation treatment. However, the total, organic and inorganic P contents from 20 to 60 cm under drip irrigation treatment were higher than or close to those under furrow irrigation treatment, but were lower under subsurface irrigation treatment than under furrow irrigation treatment. Under subsurface irrigation treatment, the contents of total, organic and inorganic P at the 0-10 cm layer were 78.0%, 1.3% and 3.7% greater than those at the 10-20 cm layer, respectively. But Olsen P content at the 10-20 cm layer was 5.7% larger than that at the 0-10 cm layer. These suggested that soil P behavior could be manipulated by soil water management to some extent.

AB  - The yield of any crop depends on soil moisture. One of the moisture conservation technological methods is fallow in the form of soil mulch with a layer not exceeding a thickness of 5-6 cm. To create this, a harrow utilizing special working devices was designed. This paper presents the results obtained on the dynamics of changes in soil moisture in a fallow field treated with a new harrowing unit compared to a serial cultivator operating at a depth higher than 6 cm. It was observed that the soil moisture in the harrowed area of the fallow field was 1.4 times higher, while the moisture reserves were 2.2 times higher in contrast to the field with the agrotechnical environment, treated with the sweeps of a serial cultivator. The actual soil tillage depth uniformity reached with the new harrowing unit is higher in comparison to that of the basic cultivator unit because, according to the F-test, the dispersion of fluctuations in the field tillage depth by the former (0.64 cm(2)) is significantly less than that for the latter (3.24 cm(2)).

AB  - Restoration of diverse semi-natural grasslands is potentially limited by high availability of soil phosphorus (P). Successful targeting of restoration effort requires a knowledge of plant community tolerances to soil P availability. Many extraction methods for P availability have been developed but most are calibrated against the growth and P uptake of crop species grown in monoculture.
   To test which methods are most suitable for measuring available P in soils of mesotrophic grasslands, a bioassay experiment was undertaken to compare seven extraction methods with the growth and P uptake of grassland species. Five species were grown together on a soil treated to create a range of conditions of pH, mycorrhizal infection and P availability.
   Olsen P and Bray P were found to be significantly correlated with P uptake in plant growth across the range of soil treatments whilst ion exchange membrane P and resin P were significantly correlated with P uptake in plant growth in all but the calcareous soils. The acid extractions of Truog, acetic acid and EDTA-ammonium acetate were found to be less correlated with P uptake in plant growth. All extraction methods correlated more strongly with P uptake in the sterilised treatments than in those inoculated with mycorrhizal spores.
   The method of Olsen was therefore selected to analyse P availability in soils supporting a range of mesotrophic grassland communities from eleven sites across England. At each sampling location, the species composition of the vegetation was assessed and classified using the British National Vegetation Classification (NVC). Species-rich hay meadows across a range of alliances were found to occur on soils with low phosphorus availability. Species-poor communities, such as inundation grassland, were found to occur on soils with higher phosphorus availability. Pasture communities, of intermediate species richness, tended to occur on soils of intermediate phosphorus availability.
   Olsen's method of P extraction is recommended for analysing soils of areas identified for habitat creation; values of less than 10 mg kg(-1) will give the greatest potential for the restoration of species-rich mesotrophic grassland. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Cassava (Manihot esculentaCrantz) yield could be improved by drip irrigation if irrigation scheduling is correctly organized. Soil moisture content is an important factor for controlling irrigation. It can be directly monitored by soil moisture sensors or predicted by soil water balance (SWB) models. Field experiments were conducted to investigate cassava production under drip irrigation and to determine the relationship between soil moisture content predicted from SWB models and actual measurements from soil moisture sensors. Treatments were carried out in a randomized complete block design with four replications including: T-1: rainfed; T-2: drip irrigation controlled by soil moisture sensors; T-3: drip irrigation controlled by a SWB model. The results showed that cassava yield and water use efficiency in irrigated treatments were higher than in rainfed treatments but there were no significant differences between T(2)and T-3. The predicted soil moisture content (SMCp) was slightly higher than the measured soil moisture content (SMCm). The difference between SMCp and SMCm was consistently the same throughout the measuring period. The overall results confirmed that the SWB model can be accurately used to predict soil moisture content. Drip irrigation controlled by the SWB model achieved a high cassava yield and WUE values similar to those produced using drip irrigation controlled by a soil moisture sensor.

AB  - Soil moisture information is critically important for water management operations including flood forecasting, drought monitoring, and groundwater recharge estimation. While an accurate and continuous record of soil moisture is required for these applications, the available soil moisture data, in practice, is typically fraught with missing values. There are a wide range of methods available to infilling hydrologic variables, but a thorough inter-comparison between statistical methods and artificial neural networks has not been made. This study examines 5 statistical methods including monthly averages, weighted Pearson correlation coefficient, a method based on temporal stability of soil moisture, and a weighted merging of the three methods, together with a method based on the concept of rough sets. Additionally, 9 artificial neural networks are examined, broadly categorized into feedforward, dynamic, and radial basis networks. These 14 infilling methods were used to estimate missing soil moisture records and subsequently validated against known values for 13 soil moisture monitoring stations for three different soil layer depths in the Yanco region in southeast Australia. The evaluation results show that the top three highest performing methods are the nonlinear autoregressive neural network, rough sets method, and monthly replacement. A high estimation accuracy (root mean square error (RMSE) of about 0.03 m(3)/m(3)) was found in the nonlinear autoregressive network, due to its regression based dynamic network which allows feedback connections through discrete-time estimation. An equally high accuracy (0.05 m(3)/m(3) RMSE) in the rough sets procedure illustrates the important role of temporal persistence of soil moisture, with the capability to account for different soil moisture conditions.

AB  - Knowledge of the soil water content (SWC) is important for many aspects of agriculture and must be monitored to maximize crop yield, efficiently use limited supplies of irrigation water, and ensure optimal nutrient management with minimal environmental impact. Single-location sensors are often used to monitor SWC, but a limited number of point measurements is insufficient to measure SWC across most fields since SWC is typically very heterogeneous. To overcome this difficulty, several researchers have used data acquired from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to predict the SWC by using machine learning on a limited number of point measurements acquired across a field. While useful, these methods are limited by the relatively small number of SWC measurements that can be acquired with conventional measurement techniques. This study uses UAV-based data and thousands of SWC measurements acquired using geophysical methods at two different depths and before and after precipitation to predict the SWC using the random forest method across a vineyard in the central United States. Both multispectral data (five reflectance bands and eleven vegetation indices calculated from these bands) and thermal UAV-based data were acquired, and the importance of different reflectance data and vegetation indices in the prediction of SWC was analyzed. Results showed that when both thermal and multispectral data were used to estimate SWC, the thermal data contributed the most to prediction accuracy, although multispectral data were also important. Reflectance data contributed as much or more to prediction accuracy than most vegetation indices. SWC measurements that had a larger sample size and greater penetration depth (similar to 30 cm sampling depth) were more accurately predicted than smaller and shallower SWC estimates (similar to 18 cm sampling depth). The timing of SWC estimation was also important; higher accuracy predictions were achieved in wetter soils than in drier soils, and a light precipitation event also improved prediction accuracy.

AB  - Determining and predicting both the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture content is a critical factor in crop production in semi-arid agricultural systems. The objective of this research was to predict the spatial distribution of soil moisture content using ordinary kriging (OK), regression kriging (RK) and cokriging (CK) models. For that purpose, the soil moisture was monitored in the wet period (March, April and May) and dry period (August, September and October) in Kadinhani district of Konya Province, Turkey. In each monthly sampling period of the study, a total of 278 samples were collected from locations within an area of 29,608.6 ha. The coefficients of variation (CV) of the soil moisture in dry and wet soil conditions were 0.39 and 0.20, respectively. Soil texture, bulk density (BD) and land use were the most important factors influencing soil moisture. In addition, dry soil generally had a smaller nugget effect than wet soil. Overall, CK was able to better estimate the soil moisture content than OK and RK, as evidenced by the smaller mean absolute error (MAE) and mean square error (MSE). RK estimation is more vulnerable to error than CK and OK estimations because the low coefficients of determination in the regression equation lead to increased error and lower confidence in the estimates. The insights generated by the modeling utilized in this study can assist land use planners, land managers and farmers to more efficiently predict, manage and utilize soil moisture content and hence produce larger crops more sustainably.

AB  - The main objective of this study was to investigate soil-plant-water interactions based on field measurements of plant reflectance and soil water content (SWC) in different inter-row managed sloping vineyards. The following three different soil management applications were studied: tilled (T), cover crops (CC), and permanent grass (NT) inter-rows. We measured SWCs within the row and between rows of vines. Each investigated row utilized 7 to 10 measurement points along the slope. Topsoil SWC and temperature, leaf NDVI and chlorophyll concentrations and leaf area index (LAI) were measured every two weeks over the vegetation period (May to November) using handheld instruments. We found that management method and slope position can significantly affect the soil's physical and chemical properties, such as clay or soil organic carbon contents. Cover crops in the inter-row significantly reduced average SWC. The in-row average topsoil SWCs and temperatures were lower in all study sites compared to the values measured in between rows. Significantly higher SWCs were observed for the upper points compared to the lower ones for CC and T treatments (58.0 and 60.9%, respectively), while the opposite was noted for NT. Grassed inter-row grapevines had significantly lower leaf chlorophyll content than the other inter-row managed sites (p < 0.001). The highest average leaf chlorophyll contents were observed in the T vineyard (16.89 CCI). Based on slope positions, the most distinguishable difference was observed for the CC: 27.7% higher chlorophyll values were observed at the top of the slope compared to the grapevine leaves at the bottom of the slope (p < 0.01). The leaf NDVI values were not as profoundly influenced by slope position in the vineyard as the chlorophyll values were. For overall LAI values, the T treatment had significantly lower values compared to NT and CC (p < 0.001). Moderate correlations were observed between NDVI and LAI and soil nitrogen and carbon content. In general, we found that both inter-row management and slope position can significantly influence soil parameters and affect plant growth, and consequently can accelerate plant stress under sub-optimal environmental conditions such as prolonged drought.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the suitability of active infrared thermography and thermometry in combination with multivariate statistical partial least squares analysis as rapid soil water content detection techniques both in the laboratory and the field. Such techniques allow fast soil water content measurements helpful in both agricultural and environmental fields. These techniques, based on the theory of heat dissipation, were tested by directly measuring temperature dynamic variation of samples after heating. For the assessment of temperature dynamic variations data were collected during three intervals (3, 6 and 10 s). To account for the presence of specific heats differences between water and soil, the analyses were regulated using slopes to linearly describe their trends. For all analyses, the best model was achieved for a 10 s slope. Three different approaches were considered, two in the laboratory and one in the field. The first laboratory-based one was centred on active infrared thermography, considered measurement of temperature variation as independent variable and reported r = 0.74. The second laboratory-based one was focused on active infrared thermometry, added irradiation as independent variable and reported r = 0.76. The in-field experiment was performed by active infrared thermometry, heating bare soil by solar irradiance after exposure due to primary tillage. Some meteorological parameters were inserted as independent variables in the prediction model, which presented r = 0.61. In order to obtain more general and wide estimations in-field a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis on three classes of percentage of soil water content was performed obtaining a high correct classification in the test (88.89%). The prediction error values were lower in the field with respect to laboratory analyses. Both techniques could be used in conjunction with a Geographic Information System for obtaining detailed information on soil heterogeneity.

AB  - This paper compared two soil moisture downscaling methods using three scaling factors. Level 3 soil moisture product of advanced microwave scanning radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) is downscaled from 25 to 1 km. The downscaled results are compared with the soil moisture observations from polarimetric scanning radiometer (PSR) microwave radiometer and field sampling. The results show that (1) the scaling factor of normalized soil thermal inertia (NSTIs) and vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI) are better than soil evaporative efficiency in reflecting soil moisture; (2) for method 1, NSTIS is the best in the downscaling of soil moisture. For method 2, VTCI is the best; (3) no significant differences of the correlation coefficients (R-2) and the biases were found between the two methods for the same scaling factors. However, method 2 shows a better potential than method 1 in the time-series applications of the downscaling of soil moisture; (4) compared with the relationship between the area-averaged soil moisture of AMSR-E and that of PSR, R-2 of the 6 sets of the downscaled soil moisture almost do not decrease, which suggests the validity of the downscaling of soil moisture with the two downscaling methods using the three scaling factors.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key factor in energy and water cycles. Many satellite missions have been planned and implemented for retrieving soil moisture globally. Because the spatial representativeness of a point-scale soil moisture station is rather limited, a station network needs setting up for scale-matching validation of satellite-based soil moisture products. Even so, an upscaling procedure is needed to upscale these station soil moisture values into area-wide one. However, such a procedure itself introduces uncertainties into the upscaled soil moisture. In this study, four upscaling methods (simple average, block kriging, model-based, and apparent-thermal-inertia-based) are inter-compared according to their performance stability for evaluation of soil moisture estimated by assimilating microwave signals into a land surface model. It is found that the performance of the model-based upscaling approach is the most unstable because model simulations are full of uncertainties for representing spatial variability of soil moisture. The block kriging upscaling method performs not worse than the simple averaging approach; the former may generate more representative soil moisture if the range of the soil moisture semivariogram used in the block kriging is comparable to the extent of a satellite footprint. The apparent-thermal-inertia-based upscaling is the most stable one, which has been developed with the aid of high-resolution satellite thermal data. All analyses indicate that choosing a suitable upscaling approach is important for the effective evaluation of satellite-based soil moisture. Otherwise, uncertainties hiding in the upscaling method will be incorrectly attributed to errors in satellite products, undermining our confidence in implementing them into practice.

AB  - Six interpolation methods for infilling daily in situ soil moisture are evaluated at 36 Oklahoma Mesonet stations from 2000 to 2007. The performance of artificial neural network (ANN), coefficient of correlation weighting, inverse distance weighting, daily average replacement (DAR), ordinary kriging, and spatial regression are compared using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure. These six methods are evaluated based on their accuracy as well as their computational complexity and applicability to the North American Soil Moisture Database. We conclude that the ANN and DAR methods are the most accurate. Both methods were applied to infill soil moisture for cross-correlation analysis. The analysis was used to examine the relationship between near-surface and deeper soil moisture layers. Peak cross correlations between the 5 and 25cm layers varied between sites, ranging from 0.62 to 0.95 with an overall site average of 0.78. The lag at which the highest correlation between the 5 and 25cm layers occurred ranged from 1 to 4days. The relationship between the near-surface and deep soil layers is strongly modulated by spatial patterns of precipitation.

AB  - Due to limited in situ observations, prediction of large-scale soil moisture content (SMC) for deep soil layers via interpolation is usually very challenging. This is especially true for regions with high spatial variations of terrain features. For precise prediction at a regional scale, SMC data for the 0- to 500-cm soil profile across China's Loess Plateau (CLP) region were collected and interpolated using four different methods. The methods included inverse distance weighting (IDW), ordinary kriging (OK), multiple linear regression with residual kriging (MLR-RK), and radial basis function neural network with residual kriging (RBFNN-RK). The objective of the study was to determine the optimal interpolation method for predicting regional SMC at various soil layers. The study showed that the performances of IDW, OK, and RBFNN-RK in predicting SMC were generally much better than that of MLR-RK. Specifically, IDW performed best for soil depths of 200300 and 400500 cm. This was attributed to the more uniform distribution (smoother change of spatial clusters) of SMC in these two layers. The OK method performed best for the 10- to 40- and 40- to 100-cm soil layers, which was due to the strong spatial dependence of the two layers. The RBFNN-RK performed best for the 0- to 10-, 100- to 200-, and 300- to 400-cm soil layers, because RBFNN-RK captures nonlinear relations of SMC with environmental factors. Ordinary kriging, IDW, and RBFNN-RK interpolation can therefore be used to predict regional SMC for different soil layers in CLP region. The RBFNN-RK method was recommended for predicting regional SMC in complex topographic hilly-gully regions where there is nonlinear relation between SMC and environmental variables.

AB  - The application of methods of modern theory of Brownian motion to the calculation of fluctuations of soil moisture reserve is considered. Analytical dependences of the correlation time of soil moisture reserve fluctuations and its mean on the characteristics of external stochastic and deterministic impacts are obtained for a nonlinear hydrological model of moisture reserve formation based on Langevin equation and generalized Langevin relationships. Variations of the low-frequency part of the spectrum of fast synoptic variables (the difference between precipitation and evaporation) because of interaction with moisture reserve fluctuations is examined. A new effect-an increase in the spectrum in the intermediate domain of time intervals between characteristic times-is explained by the time of variations of synoptic fluctuations and the time of variations of fluctuations of soil moisture reserve. The problem of determining a non-steady response of the mean soil moisture reserve to fluctuation of moistening regime is used to demonstrate the potentialities of a new apparatus of statistical physics-fluctuation theorems.

AB  - To protect fragile groundwater-dependent environments of arid zones, it is important to monitor soil moisture and groundwater evaporation. Hence, it is important to assess new methods to quantify these environmental variables. In this work, we propose a new method to determine groundwater evaporation rates by combining the actively heated fiber-optic (AHFO) method with vadose zone modeling, assuming that the evaporation front remains at the soil surface. In our study, the AHFO method yielded estimates of the soil moisture (theta) profile with a spatial resolution of similar to 6.5 mm and with an error of 0.026 m(3) m(-3). The numerical model resulted in a slightly different theta profile than that measured, where the largest differences occurred at the soil surface. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses highlighted that a better precision is required when determining the soil hydraulic parameters. To improve the proposed method, the soil heat-vapor-water dynamics should be included and the assumption that the evaporation front remains at the soil surface must be relaxed. Additionally, if the AHFO calibration curve is enhanced, the errors of the estimated theta profile can be reduced and thus, successful estimation of the evaporation rates for a wider range of soil textures can be achieved. The spatial scales measured are an important advantage of the proposed method that should be further explored to improve the analysis presented here.

AB  - Root zone soil moisture (RZSM) controls vegetation transpiration and hydraulic distribution processes and plays a key role in energy and water exchange between land surface and atmosphere; hence, accurate estimation of RZSM is crucial for agricultural irrigation management practices. Traditional methods to measure soil moisture at stations are laborious and spatially uneven, making it difficult to obtain soil moisture data on a large scale. Remote sensing techniques can provide soil moisture in a large-scale range, but they can only provide surface soil moisture (SSM) with a depth of approximately 5-10 cm. In order to obtain a large range of soil moisture for deeper soil layers, especially the crop root zone with a depth of about 100-200 cm, numerous methods based on remote sensing inversion have been proposed. This paper analyzes and summarizes the research progress of remote sensing-based RZSM estimation methods in the past few decades and classifies these methods into four categories: empirical methods, semi-empirical methods, physics-based methods, and machine learning methods. Then, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods are outlined. Additionally an outlook on the future development of RZSM estimation methods is made and discussed.

AB  - In view of the low spatial resolution of passive microwave soil moisture (SM) data, statistical and physical models including random forest (RF), polynomial fitting and DISPATCH are utilized to disaggregate the FY3B microwave SM product from 25 km to 1 km with the synergistic application of Optical/Thermal infrared (TIR) observations and surface elevation parameters. Meanwhile, considering different overpass times of FY3B and other relevant input data source observations, four data combinations are separately used to derive the spatially downscaled SM with above three downscaling method, and the optimized data combination of FY-3B downscaling is proposed by comparison and analysis. Validation is performed from April 1, 2015 to December 31, 2016 with the in-situ measurements of REMEDHUS network and the precipitation time series of ECA&D meteorological site. Experimental results show that RF-based method can achieve the highest comprehensive downscaling accuracy and the best model fitting effect. In addition, the effect of applying FY-3B ascending data to downscale turns out to be better.

AB  - The development of high-yielding crops with drought tolerance is necessary to increase food, feed, fiber and fuel production. Methods that create similar environmental conditions for a large number of genotypes are essential to investigate plant responses to drought in gene discovery studies. Modern facilities that control water availability for each plant remain cost-prohibited to some sections of the research community. We present an alternative cost-effective automated irrigation system scalable for a high-throughput and controlled dry-down treatment of plants. This system was tested in sorghum using two experiments. First, four genotypes were subjected to ten days of dry-down to achieve three final Volumetric Water Content (VWC) levels: drought (0.10 and 0.20 m(3) m(-3)) and control (0.30 m(3) m(-3)). The final average VWC was 0.11, 0.22, and 0.31 m(3) m(-3), respectively, and significant differences in biomass accumulation were observed between control and drought treatments. Second, 42 diverse sorghum genotypes were subjected to a seven-day dry-down treatment for a final drought stress of 0.15 m(3) m(-3) VWC. The final average VWC was 0.17 m(3) m(-3) , and plants presented significant differences in photosynthetic rate during the drought period. These results demonstrate that cost-effective automation systems can successfully control substrate water content for each plant, to accurately compare their phenotypic responses to drought, and be scaled up for high-throughput phenotyping studies.

AB  - Soil moisture content (SMC) plays an important role in the hydrological functioning of wetlands. Remote sensing shows potential for the quantification and monitoring of the SMC of palustrine wetlands; however, this technique remains to be assessed across a wetland-terrestrial gradient in South Africa. The ability of the Sentinel Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical sensors, which are freely available from the European Space Agency, were evaluated to predict SMC for a palustrine wetland and surrounding terrestrial areas in the grassland biome of South Africa. The percentage of volumetric water content (%VWC) was measured across the wetland and terrestrial areas of the Colbyn Wetland Nature Reserve, located in the City of Tshwane Metropolitan Municipality of the Gauteng Province, using a handheld SMT-100 soil moisture meter at a depth of 5 cm during the peak and end of the hydroperiod in 2018. The %VWC was regressed against the Sentinel imagery, using random forest, simple linear and support vector machine regression models. Random forest yielded the highest prediction accuracies in comparison to the other models. The results indicate that the Sentinel images have the potential to be used to predict SMC with a high coefficient of determination (Sentinel-1 SAR = R-2>0.9; Sentinel-2 optical = R-2>0.9) and a relatively low root mean square error (Sentinel-1 RMSE = <17%; Sentinel-2 optical = RMSE <21%). Predicted maps show higher ranges of SMC for wetlands (> 50%VWC; p<0.05) compared to terrestrial areas, and therefore SMC monitoring may benefit the inventorying of wetlands, as well as monitoring of their extent and ecological condition.
   Significance:
   The freely available and space-borne Sentinel sensors show potential for the quantification of surface soil moisture across a wetland-terrestrial gradient.
   Significant differences between the surface soil moisture of palustrine wetlands and terrestrial areas, imply that inventorying and monitoring of the extent and hydroperiod of palustrine wetlands can potentially be done.

AB  - This study develops an indirect method for the estimation of surface soil moisture (SM) by means of monitoring in situ soil water potential. Field work was carried out in ten sampling units selected according to coverage, soil, and topographic factors. Relative humidity and soil temperature were hourly measured to assess the soil-water potential through Kelvin's Law for each sampling unit. Water potential was used as input in the soil moisture retention curve for field conditions to assess SM by fitting the Fredlund-Xing model. To verify the performance of our approach, we measured the surface volumetric SM by the gravimetric method for 2,211 soil samples collected in the same survey period. Results show a non-linear relationship between gravimetric SM and the indirect estimation displaying a determination coefficient of 68.4%. The proposed approach is a suitable exploratory alternative to support continuous SM monitoring studies. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper combines data from soil moisture capacitance probes and a cosmic-ray neutron probe in a fuzzy inference system to estimate spatially variable soil moisture in a similar to 28 ha circular area at an hourly interval in northeast Tasmania, Australia. The technique uses hourly counts of cosmic-ray neutrons, a network of 25 capacitance probes measuring soil moisture at half hourly intervals and at five depths (0-50 cm), and a multiple adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system. We quantified soil moisture in the top portion of the soil during wet and dry periods for training and testing periods. After training, the technique provided reliable estimates of temporal pattern of soil moisture at 10- and 20-cm depths during a wet period using input data only from the cosmic-ray neutron probe. There was over-prediction of soil moisture during a dry period, which suggests a longer training period representative of the full range of likely conditions might be required. Spatial maps of soil water content produced from the single cosmic-ray neutron probe were similar to those of the capacitance probe.

AB  - Per capita arable land is decreasing due to the rapidly increasing population, and fresh water is becoming scarce and more expensive. Therefore, farmers should continue to use technology and innovative solutions to improve efficiency, save input costs, and optimise environmental resources (such as water). In the case study presented in this paper, the Global Navigation Satellite System interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) technique was used to monitor soil moisture during 66 d, from 3 December 2018 to 6 February 2019, in the installations of the Cajamar Centre of Experiences, Paiporta, Valencia, Spain. Two main objectives were pursued. The first was the extension of the technique to a multi-constellation solution using GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO satellites, and the second was to test whether mass-market sensors could be used for this technique. Both objectives were achieved. At the same time that the GNSS observations were made, soil samples taken at 5 cm depth were used for soil moisture determination to establish a reference data set. Based on a comparison with that reference data set, all GNSS solutions, including the three constellations and the two sensors (geodetic and mass market), were highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient between 0.7 and 0.85.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess, under laboratory and field conditions, the performance of the Decagon 5TE and GS3 soil water sensors in estimating the soil water content of saline-alkali reclaimed land in South Korea. The error due to increased bulk soil EC was greater for the 5TE sensor than for the GS3 sensor and was greater in soil with higher bulk soil EC. Therefore, it is recommended that the soil electrical conductivity be considered in the calibration process for the 5TE. The calibration equations developed for the 5TE and GS3 sensors during laboratory experiments were highly accurate. Testing of the 5TE and GS3 sensors showed very good agreement between actual VWC and VWC calculations resulting from the field-derived calibration. These results suggest that either sensor can be used to acquire accurate soil water content data in the field.

AB  - The use of soil moisture sensors is a practice applied to improve irrigation water management. ECH2O-5TE sensors are increasingly being used to estimate the volumetric water content (VWC). In view of the importance of the efficient use of these devices, six main factors affecting the accuracy of sensor measurements were studied: soil moisture levels, soil salinity, temperature, organic matter, soil texture, and bulk density. The study showed that the electrical conductivity of the soil and the temperature independently affect the measurements, while the influence of other factors interferes with that of salinity. This study found that the sensor measurements of the VWC were closest to the actual VWC at the soil ECe and temperatures of 2.42 dS m(-1) and 25 ?, with root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.003 and 0.004 m(3) m(-3). Otherwise, the measured VWC values of these sensor readouts significantly overestimated the actual VWC, with an increasing soil ECe and/or producing temperatures higher than the stated values, and vice versa. Given the importance of these sensors for obtaining accurate measurements for water management, a simplified empirical equation was derived using the data collected from a wide range of measurements to correct the influences of electrical conductivity and temperature on the measurement accuracy of the sensors, while considering the influence of the soil's texture. Thus, the following equation was proposed: ?va = theta vsaECe2+bECe+c+dT2+eT+f-1. The results concerning the measurement of different VWC levels via these sensors and the proposed L & O correction equation were compared with the corresponding actual VWC values determined by gravimetric methods. It was found that this empirical equation reduced the differences in the RMSE between the sensor readings for the VWC and the actual VWC from 0.072 and 0.252 to 0.030 and 0.030 m(3) m(-3) for 1 and 5 dS m(-1), respectively, with respect to the EC's influence at 25? and reduced the RMSE from 0.053 and 0.098 to 0.007 and 0.011 at 3 and 50 ?, respectively, regarding the effect of the temperature at EC 2.42 dS m(-1) at different levels of the actual VWC values.

AB  - Although cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is probably the most promising noninvasive proximal soil moisture measurement technique at the field scale, its application for hydrological simulations remains underexplored in the literature so far. This study assessed the use of CRNS to inversely calibrate soil hydraulic parameters at the intermediate field scale to simulate the groundwater recharge rates at a daily timescale. The study was conducted for two contrasting hydrological years at the Guaraira experimental basin, Brazil, a 5.84-km(2), a tropical wet and rather flat landscape covered by secondary Atlantic forest. As a consequence of the low altitude and proximity to the equator low neutron count rates could be expected, reducing the precision of CRNS while constituting unexplored and challenging conditions for CRNS applications. Inverse calibration for groundwater recharge rates was used based on CRNS or point-scale soil moisture data. The CRNS-derived retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity were consistent with the literature and locally performed slug tests. Simulated groundwater recharge rates ranged from 60 to 470 mm yr(-1), corresponding to 5 and 29% of rainfall, and correlated well with estimates based on water table fluctuations. In contrast, the estimated results based on inversive point-scale datasets were not in alignment with measured water table fluctuations. The better performance of CRNS-based estimations of field-scale hydrological variables, especially groundwater recharge, demonstrated its clear advantages over traditional invasive point-scale techniques. Finally, the study proved the ability of CRNS as practicable in low altitude, tropical wet areas, thus encouraging its adoption for water resources monitoring and management.

AB  - Electromagnetic induction (EMI) measurements return an apparent electrical conductivity that represents a weighted average of the electrical conductivity distribution over a certain depth range. Different sensing depths are obtained for different orientations, different coil off sets, and different frequencies, which, in principle, can be used for a multi-layer inversion. However, instrumental shifts, which often occur in EMI data, prevent the use of quantitative multi-layer inversion. Recently, a new calibration method was developed that uses electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) inversion results and returns quantitative apparent conductivity values. Here, we introduce an inversion scheme that uses calibrated EMI data and inverts for a two-layer earth. The inversion minimizes the misfit between the measured and modeled magnetic field by a combined global and local search and does not use any smoothing parameter. Application of this new scheme to synthetic data demonstrates its efficacy in providing the required physical property information. Inversion of calibrated experimental EMI data using horizontal coplanar (HCP) and vertical coplanar (VCP) loop configurations, coil off sets of 1 and 1.22 m, and frequencies of 8 and 15 kHz provides lateral and vertical conductivity variations very similar to those observed in an elaborate ERT experiment. The inversion is verified using synthetic EMI data calculated from ERT data. Inverting quantitative EMI data using this two-layer inversion enables the quantitative mapping of lateral and vertical electrical conductivity variations over large areas.

AB  - Obtaining accurate soil moisture data from sensors in automated monitoring networks is critical as these data are increasingly used for research in soil hydrology, ecohydrology, and related disciplines. One of the earliest such networks is the Oklahoma Mesonet, which monitors soil matric potential using heat dissipation sensors. Various calibration equations have been proposed for those sensors, and there is a need to compare and validate the performance of those equations, especially for matric potentials < -150 kPa. A laboratory experiment was conducted in silt loam soil using a sand-kaolin box and a pressure plate apparatus with matric potentials ranging from 0 to -1500 kPa. The calibration equations included Starks' equation, Flint et al.'s equation, Schneider et al.'s equation, and a new logistic equation. The upper limit of the sensors was -9 kPa, and the sensors remained responsive at -1500 kPa matric potential. The logistic equation produced the lowest root mean squared error (34 kPa), followed by Flint et al.'s equation (192 kPa), Starks' equation (295 kPa), and Schneider et al.'s equation (463 kPa). After recalibration of the coefficients in the three preexisting equations, their performances improved, with all RMSE values <= 251 kPa; however, the logistic equation still provided superior accuracy. The logistic equation effectively removed an similar to 0.02 cm(3) cm(-3) positive bias in soil water content that resulted from use of the original parameterization of Schneider et al.'s equation. This logistic equation is recommended for use with past and future data from the Oklahoma Mesonet's heat dissipation sensors.

AB  - Acquiring soil moisture content (SMC) in a mobile way when opening furrows during planting can improve the timeliness of the information to help make planting decision. Common commercial TDR SMC probe sensors was used to discuss the feasibility of applying probe sensors on on-the-go SMC measurement. And a revolving test bench with regulated speed was used to repeatedly conduct dynamic test. The dynamic test results showed common probe sensors can be used for mobile SMC measurement. The optimal measuring attitude of the probe sensor was that the front side of the probe sensor was vertical to soil surface and the probes inclined from the side view (FVSI). When the travel speed was not over 4.8 km/h, the dynamic measured and the static measured after the dynamic test by FVSI owned good correlation. In addition, the movement of the rods of the sensor had relatively stable influence on soil density during the dynamic movement.

AB  - Among the diverse techniques for monitoring soil moisture, capacitance-type soil moisture sensors are popular because of their low cost, low maintenance requirements, and acceptable performance. However, although in laboratory conditions the accuracy of these sensors is good, when installed in the field they tend to show large sensor-to-sensor differences, especially under drip irrigation. It makes difficult to decide in which positions the sensors are installed and the interpretation of the recorded data. The aim of this paper is to study the variability involved in the measurement of soil moisture by capacitance sensors in a drip-irrigated orchard and, using this information, find ways to optimize their usage to manage irrigation. For this purpose, the study examines the uncertainties in the measurement process plus the natural variability in the actual soil water dynamics. Measurements were collected by 57 sensors, located at 10 combinations of depth and position relative to the dripper. Our results showed large sensor-to-sensor differences, even when installed at equivalent depth and coordinates relative to the drippers. In contrast, differences among virtual sensors simulated using a HYDRUS-3D model at those soil locations were one order of magnitude smaller. Our results highlight, as a possible cause for the sensor-to-sensor differences in the measurements by capacitance sensors, the natural variability in size, shape, and centering of the wet area below the drippers, combined with the sharply defined variation in water content at the soil scale perceived by the sensors.

AB  - Global soil moisture products retrieved from various remote sensing sensors are becoming readily available with a nearly daily temporal resolution. Active and passive microwave sensors are generally considered as the best technologies for retrieving soil moisture from space. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth observing system (AMSR-E) on-board the Aqua satellite and the Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) on-board the MetOp (Meteorological Operational) satellite are among the sensors most widely used for soil moisture retrieval in the last years. However, due to differences in the spatial resolution, observation depths and measurement uncertainties, validation of satellite data with in situ observations and/or modelled data is not straightforward. In this study, a comprehensive assessment of the reliability of soil moisture estimations from the ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors is carried out by using observed and modelled soil moisture data over 17 sites located in 4 countries across Europe (Italy, Spain, France and Luxembourg). As regards satellite data, products generated by implementing three different algorithms with AMSR-E data are considered: (i) the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, LPRM, (ii) the standard NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) algorithm, and (iii) the Polarization Ratio Index, PRI. For ASCAT the Vienna University of Technology, TUWIEN, change detection algorithm is employed. An exponential filter is applied to approach root-zone soil moisture. Moreover, two different scaling strategies, based respectively on linear regression correction and Cumulative Density Function (CDF) matching, are employed to remove systematic differences between satellite and site-specific soil moisture data. Results are shown in terms of both relative soil moisture values (i.e., between 0 and 1) and anomalies from the climatological expectation.
   Among the three soil moisture products derived from AMSR-E sensor data, for most sites the highest correlation with observed and modelled data is found using the LPRM algorithm. Considering relative soil moisture values for an similar to 5 cm soil layer, the TUWIEN ASCAT product outperforms AMSR-E over all sites in France and central Italy while similar results are obtained in all other regions. Specifically, the average correlation coefficient with observed (modelled) data equals to 0.71 (0.74) and 0.62 (0.72) for ASCAT and AMSR-E-LPRM, respectively. Correlation values increase up to 0.81 (0.81) and 0.69 (0.77) for the two satellite products when exponential filtering and CDF matching approaches are applied. On the other hand, considering the anomalies, correlation values decrease but, more significantly, in this case ASCAT outperforms all the other products for all sites except the Spanish ones. Overall, the reliability of all the satellite soil moisture products was found to decrease with increasing vegetation density and to be in good accordance with previous studies. The results provide an overview of the ASCAT and AMSR-E reliability and robustness over different regions in Europe, thereby highlighting advantages and shortcomings for the effective use of these data sets for operational applications such as flood forecasting and numerical weather prediction.

AB  - The heat pulse probe (HPP) method can be used to measure specific heat capacity (c), thermal conductivity (lambda), and water content of soil; however, many factors are believed to contribute to measurement errors in both lambda and c from the HPP method. The objective of this study was to examine if contact resistance, heat-driven flow, temperature-dependent thermal properties, or epoxy fillings affect the estimated soil thermal properties and water content from the HPP method. Heat pulse experiments were conducted on oven-dry sand, water-saturated sand, sand saturated with agar-stabilized water, and coarse snow (large grain size). The results showed that for the sand and coarse snow, the thermal contact resistance did not contribute to the overestimation of heat capacity. There was little difference in measured water contents between sand saturated with water and sand saturated with agar-stabilized water, suggesting no obvious heat-driven flow under saturated conditions. Compared with an 8-s hear pulse with a power strength (q) >80 W m(-1), a long heat pulse of duration 60 s and q' < 6 W m(-1) reduced the overestimation of soil c and water content (theta(w)) on oven-dry sands. Both temperature-dependent soil thermal properties and epoxy filling inside the heater needle contributed to the overestimation oft and theta(w),

AB  - Validation of soil moisture derived from space-borne passive microwave sensors remains a challenging task owing to the large variability in soil moisture within the coarse-resolution cell offered by passive sensors. In this article, nine spatial/temporal synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data sets from Radar Satellite-1 (Radarsat-1) and Environmental Satellite-1 (Envisat-1) Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar (ASAR) were used as an interface to upscale the field-level soil moisture to soil moisture at a 25 km x 25 km grid, the scale at which the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the EOS (Earth Observing System) (AMSR-E) level-3 soil moisture product is available, leading to a total of 68 such grids where there is a pair of SAR-derived and corresponding AMSR-E-derived values. Out of the these 68 grid cells, each of size 25 km x 25 km, pair data from nine dates, data corresponding to 51 grid cell pairs (from six dates) were used for the development of the approach and data corresponding to 17 grid cell pairs (from three dates) were used for validating the approach. It is observed that while the spatial variation in SAR-and AMSR-E-derived soil moisture is broadly similar, there exists a bias in the difference between AMSR-E and SAR-derived soil moisture. The root mean square (RMS) difference between AMSR-E soil moisture and SAR-derived soil moisture at 25 km over the model development sample of 51 grid cells, each of 25 km x 25 km, was observed to be 4.2 (% g cm(-3)). The study shows that the bias is significantly affected by the AMSR-E vegetation/roughness parameter, g, which is an indicator of the prevailing vegetation/surface roughness conditions. This dependence of the bias on g was exploited to arrive at modified soil moisture estimates at 25 km. The RMS difference between the modified AMSR-E soil moisture at 25 km and the SAR-derived soil moisture was observed to be 2.13 (% g cm(-3)) over a validation sample of 17 grid cells each of size 25 km x 25 km, comprising extreme, dry and wet, and soil moisture conditions. This demonstrative study provides the feasibility of calibrating and improving the soil moisture product from coarse-resolution space-borne passive sensors with the help of soil moisture derived using SAR. The approach is demonstrated for validating passive radiometer-derived soil moisture over bare/crop-covered conditions through an experiment involving 68 25 km x 25 km grid cells spread over nine temporal/spatial Radarsat and Envisat-1 satellite SAR data sets and synchronous ground soil moisture measurements over farmers' fields, covering a large range of soil/crop conditions prevailing during the nine months of SAR data acquisition. Hence the results reported in this manuscript are encouraging.

AB  - This study confirmed a utility of a 10HS sensor, a capacitance sensor, in converted paddy fields to exploit the practical influence volume from our results and the corrected FSC function. Converted paddy fields in Japan are typically used to cultivate lowland rice or upland crops, and many of them have a problem of poor drainage when upland crops are cultivated. One of the major causes of poor drainage is a presence of a hardpan layer due to soil puddling for lowland rice cultivation. To monitor soil moisture above the hardpan layer without the influence of the hardpan layer, we identified the spatial sensitivity around the sensor and determined the applicability of the sensor with the factory-supplied calibration (FSC) function, including under near-saturated conditions. As a result, regarding the spatial sensitivity, the influence volume of the sensor from our result is much smaller than that reported by Cobos (2008), and we suggested that the sensors should be installed at least 1.5 cm above the boundary between the hardpan and plowed layers. Moreover, regarding the calibrations of the sensors, a corrected FSC function that can account for the bulk density was proposed.

AB  - In this paper, we consider input-output model identification and zone model predictive control of agro-hydrological systems. Specifically, we consider an agro-hydrological system with homogeneous soil layers to illustrate the proposed model identification and predictive control methods. The primary control objective is to maintain the soil moisture at the center of the root zone within a target zone. A secondary control objective is to reduce the total amount of water used in irrigation. First, a linear parameter varying (LPV) model for controller design purpose is identified. Then, based on the LPV model, a zone model predictive control (MPC) is designed, which uses asymmetric zone tracking penalties to reduce irrigation amount under weather uncertainties while maintaining the soil moisture within the target zone. The simulation results show that the LPV model provides satisfactory approximation of the process dynamics, and the designed zone MPC is suitable for irrigation of the agro-hydrological system.

AB  - Soil phosphorus (P) utilization may be affected by agricultural complexity, in particular when combining annual crops and livestock grazing on the same land area and at overlapping times. Our objectives were to qualify and quantify soil organic and inorganic P compounds using sodium hydroxide-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (NaOH-EDTA) extraction and P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) in response to increasing complexity with integrated crop-livestock systems (ICLS) in subtropical Brazil. Soil at a depth of 0-5 cm was collected from three long-term (7 to 12 years) cropping studies with and without ruminant grazing of cover crops. All sites were managed under no tillage, and treatments with livestock were managed with moderate grazing intensity. In these agro-ecosystems, grazing compared with no-grazing had greater soil P content as total and bioavailable orthophosphate and lower soil organic P and fewer monoesters, including inositol phosphates. Grazing increased P bioavailability and reduced recalcitrant organic P concentration in soil; therefore, cropping systems that integrate livestock (ICLS) can be a sustainable alternative to improve P use in farming systems of subtropical Brazil.

AB  - Agricultural systems are increasingly challenged of achieving high yields while optimizing plant water consumption. Soil conservation practices are preponderant in rain-fed agriculture for increasing water infiltration, water storage in the soil, and for promoting root development. This study aimed to assess the spatial-temporal soil water content (theta) dynamics identified by the application of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys in an Oxisol under grain production systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. The utilized cropping systems were: soybean monoculture (SS); maize monoculture (MM); maize/soybean rotation (MS); maize/soybean rotation with intercropped brachiaria (MBSB); maize/soybean rotation with high fertilizer investment (MS-HI), and MBSB and high fertilizer investment (MBSB-HI). ERT measurements were performed at field conditions using different time-steps during the rainy (March, 2019) and dry seasons (July 2018 and 2019). Logarithmic and power models were tested for evaluating the relationships between theta and the electrical resistivity (rho). Results showed ERT was adequate for monitoring the spatial-temporal theta variation and for inferring soil-plant related processes (i.e., water uptake and macro-porosity due to roots development). The power model was more suitable in depicting the theta - rho relationship, and for imaging the water unavailability for plants during the dry periods. Intercropped brachiaria positively affected the theta dynamics due to its aggressive root systems. MBSB-HI showed the highest theta values in the rainy season, demonstrating that ecological intensified cropping systems can help overcome severe dry spells, in the Brazilian Cerrado.

AB  - The performance of the Irrometer 200SS Watermark granular matrix sensor (WM), John Deere Field Connect (JD-v2) probe, and Delta-T PR1-capacitance (PR1-C) probe were evaluated against a Troxler 4302 neutron gauge (NG) for in-season field volumetric water content (theta(v)) measurements at two soil depths in a Hastings silt loam soil at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln/Institute of Agriculture and Natural Resources South Central Agricultural Laboratory (SCAL) near Clay Center, Nebraska. The performances of the sensors were investigated over three years (2011-2013) under various water, nutrient, and crop management practices. The WM sensors performed best when using a field-calibrated soil water retention curve (SWRC) [root mean square difference (RMSD) = 0.024 m(3) m(-3)] as compared to a SWRC developed from a pedotransfer function (RMSD = 0.070 m(3) m(-3)). The WM sensors using a previously developed SWRC for the experimental field resulted in RMSD values less than 0.05 m(3) m(-3) when compared to the NG-measured theta(v) at all depths and years. The JD-v2 probes underestimated theta(v) in the dry range and overestimated theta(v) in the wet range, which resulted in regression slopes and intercepts for the 0.30 and 1.0 m soil depths that were significantly different from unity (i.e., 1.0) and zero (p(0.05) < 0.05), respectively. However, the performance of the JD-v2 probes improved in 2013 from RMSD values of 0.066, 0.068, and 0.067 m(3) m(-3) when using the manufacturer's calibration to 0.043, 0.033, and 0.038 m(3) m(-3) for the 0.30, 1.0 m, and pooled soil depths, respectively, after calibrating the JD-v2 probes using the 2012 regression responses. The PR1-C probe-estimated theta(v) regression coefficients were also significantly different from unity and zero (p(0.05) < 0.05), respectively, and the resulting RMSD values ranged from 0.077 to 1.133 m(3) m(-3). In general, the WM and JD-v2 sensors followed the NG total water (TW) trends at all irrigation levels; however, the PR1-C probe was inconsistent and at times estimated unrealistic TW amounts. While there are limitations and concerns for each sensor technology, the results suggest that the WM and JD-v2 sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture to enhance irrigation management following field calibrations. Furthermore, development of soil-specific field calibration curves for individual soil depths is strongly recommended to enhance the performance of each sensor type and improve the accuracy of in-season field. v measurements.

AB  - Accurate measurement of soil moisture (theta) is key to hydrology and agriculture research. Soil moisture sensor technology is the predominant method for measuring theta, and such measurements are used as a standard for evaluating results from remote sensing and data assimilation. Therefore, improving the theta measurement accuracy of soil moisture sensors is of great significance. This study used the capacitance-based soil moisture sensor (5TM, Decagon Devices, Inc.) as an example to illustrate the necessity of calibration. The 5TM soil moisture sensor calculates theta by measuring the dielectric constant (epsilon) of the soil medium, and epsilon is affected by soil properties (texture, salinity, soil organic matter, etc.). Consequently, a common calibration model (CCM) was developed to calibrate theta from the 5TM sensor by incorporating the soil properties using soil samples collected from 17 sites in 13 provinces in China at 4 different depths. First, the theta change experiments were conducted in the laboratory for each soil sample. Second, a linear calibration model (LCM) was applied to calibrate the 5TM measured soil moisture (theta(5TM)) based on "true " soil moisture (theta(true)) assessed through the gravimetric method. The results indicated (1) high correlation coefficient (R = 0.95) was found for theta(5TM) and theta(true), but with a high root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.051 m(3)m(-3), and a more significant underestimation with increasing theta; (2) LCM calibration results (theta(LCM)) showed a higher R (0.99) and a lower RMSE (0.017 m(3)m(-3)). Finally, the CCM was established through relating the LCM coefficients (a(LCM) and b(LCM)) and soil properties based on multiple regression, with RMSE of 0.126 m(3)m(-3) and 0.023 m(3)m(-3) for a(CCM) and b(CCM) respectively. The CCM calibrated result (theta(CCM)) showed an RMSE of 0.02 m(3)m(-3) and R of 0.98. CCM can almost replace LCM in terms of similar accuracy. In this study, a CCM for soil moisture sensors is proposed, which provides a new approach for soil moisture sensor calibration.

AB  - There is a significant interest in the detection and monitoring of nutrient levels in agriculture farms. In this article, we report the fabrication of Zinc oxide (ZnO) modified multi-walled Carbon nanotube (F-MWCNT) sensor specifically developed for soil nutrient sensing. A thin layer of Valinomycin membrane was grown on the top of the F-MWCNT/ZnO nanocomposite active layer. The resulting composite structure Al/F-MWCNT/ZnO/Valinomycin was found to have a proportional impedance change with soil Potassium (K+) levels. The performance of the sensor was investigated in the 1- 5 kHz range. The impedance magnitude was found to linearly decrease from 2.5 +/- 0.23 to 0.63 +/- 0.12 M Omega range for K+ concentrations from 5 to 25 mM displaying a sensitivity of similar to 3 M Omega/mM with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.95744.

AB  - This review provides a detailed synthesis of various in-situ, remote sensing, and machine learning approaches to estimate soil moisture. Bibliometric analysis of the published literature on soil moisture shows that Time-Domain Reflectometry (TDR) is the most widely used in-situ instrument, while remote sensing is the most preferred application, and random forest is the widely applied algorithm to simulate surface soil moisture. We have applied ten most widely used machine learning models on a publicly available dataset (in-situ soil moisture measurement and satellite images) to predict soil moisture and compared their results. We have briefly discussed the potential of using the upcoming NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) mission images to estimate soil moisture. Finally, this review discusses the capabilities of physics-informed and automated machine learning (AutoML) models to predict the surface soil moisture at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. This review will assist researchers in investigating the applications of soil moisture in the broad domain of earth sciences.

AB  - Relative to other geophysical variables, soil moisture (SM) estimates derived from land surface models (LSMs) and land data assimilation systems (LDAS) are difficult to transfer between platforms and applications. This difficulty stems from the highly model-dependent nature of LSM SM estimates and differences in the vertical support of discretized SM values. As a result, operational SM estimates generated by one LSM (or LDAS) cannot generally be directly applied to a hydrologic monitoring or forecast system designed around a second LSM. This lack of transferability is particularly problematic for LDAS applications, where the time, expertise, and computational resources required to generate an operational LDAS analysis cannot be practically duplicated for every LSM-specific application. Here, we develop a set of simple regression tools for translating SMestimates between LSMs andmultiple LDAS analyses. Results demonstrate that simple multivariate linear regression-utilizing independent variables based on multilayer and temporally lagged SM estimates-can significantly improve upon baseline transformation approaches using direct percentile matching. The proposed regression approaches are effective for both the LSM-to-LSM and LDAS-to-LDAS transformation of multilayer SM percentiles. Application of this approach will expand the utility of existing, high-quality (but LSM-specific) operational sources of SM information like the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 Soil Moisture product.

AB  - Soil water content and matric potential are central hydrological state variables. A large variety of automated probes and sensor systems for state monitoring exist and are frequently applied. Most applications solely rely on the calibration by the manufacturers. Until now, there has been no commonly agreed-upon calibration procedure. Moreover, several opinions about the capabilities and reliabilities of specific sensing methods or sensor systems exist and compete.
   A consortium of several institutions conducted a comparison study of currently available sensor systems for soil water content and matric potential under field conditions. All probes were installed at 0.2 m b.s. (metres below surface), following best-practice procedures. We present the set-up and the recorded data of 58 probes of 15 different systems measuring soil moisture and 50 further probes of 14 different systems for matric potential. We briefly discuss the limited coherence of the measurements in a cross-correlation analysis.
   The measuring campaign was conducted during the growing period of 2016. The monitoring data, results from pedophysical analyses of the soil and laboratory reference measurements for calibration are published in Jackisch et al.

AB  - Precision Viticulture requires very fine-scale spatial and temporal resolution to assess quite accurately variation in a vineyard. Many studies have used proximal sensing technology and spatial-temporal data analysis to characterize the local variation of plant vigour over time. The objective of this study was to present the potential of multivariate geostatistical techniques to fuse multi-temporal data from a multi-band radiometer and a geophysical sensor with different support for delineation of a vineyard into homogeneous zones, to be submitted to differential agricultural management. The study was conducted in a commercial table grape vineyard located in southern Greece during the years 2016 and 2017. Soil electrical conductivity was measured using an EM38 sensor, while Crop Circle canopy sensor, with the sensor located at 1.5 m height from the soil surface and 1.2 m horizontally from the vines, was used for scanning the side canopy area at different crop stages. The temporal multi-sensor data were analysed with the geostatistical data fusion techniques of block cokriging, to produce thematic maps, and factorial block cokriging to estimate synthetic scale-dependent regionalized factors. The factor maps at different scales are characterised by random variability with several micro-structures of different plant and soil properties, which leads to difficulties in delineating macro-areas with homogeneous features. In such conditions, high resolution VRA technology should be preferred to management by homogeneous zones for precision viticulture. The results have shown the potential of the proposed approach to deal with multi-source data in precision viticulture. However, further statistical research on data fusion of the outcomes from different sensors is still needed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The different conditions of soil vegetation cover combined with irrigation management and/or agricultural production systems can influence soil moisture content and crop yields. This study investigated the impact of agricultural production systems and center pivot irrigation management on soil moisture content during the cultivation of soybean and off-season corn crops. Two field experiments were conducted during the 2018-2019 growing season in tropical Cerrado soil conditions; one experiment consisted of the application of three irrigation water depths (0%, 50%, and 100% of the crop evapotranspiration) during soybean cultivation in a no-tillage system under ruzigrass (Urochloa ruziziensis) straw, and the second experiment consisted of the intercropped or nonintercropped cultivation of corn hybrids with ruzigrass in an agricultural area with and without the influence of eucalyptus reforestation. The volumetric soil moisture was measured using an electronic soil moisture meter (Hidrofarm), and the 1000-grain mass and yield of the soybean and corn were measured in the two trials. Irrigation and the no-till system did not influence soybean yields. The soybean cultivars NA 5909 RG and TMG 7067 IPRO presented TGM above 180 g, and this represented on average a 22% higher TGM than the BMX DESAFIO RR and CD 2737 RR. The presence of eucalyptus forest promoted a 1.5% increase in soil moisture in the corn crop. Soil management systems, such as irrigation, use cover crops, which may not increase the productivity of soybean and corn crops as expected.

AB  - Capacitance probes (CP) based on responses to electromagnetic properties in soil are widely used for monitoring soil volumetric water content (theta(v)), but proper calibration is necessary to obtain reliable results. The objectives of this study were to: (i) compare errors in evaluating theta(v) when using soil-spccific equations as opposed to the manufacturer's default equation; (ii) compare the CP calibration equations obtained in the laboratory and in the field; and (iii) evaluate the accuracy of CP under field conditions using soil-specific equations as opposed to the manufacturer's default equation. Laboratory and field calibrations were conducted by fitting statistical relationships between readings from CP and theta(v) measured from soil cores. The accuracies of the obtained calibration equations were evaluated under field conditions during, two irrigation cycles. In both calibration studies, the manufacturer's default equation consistently overcalculated theta(v) (RMSE > 0.044 m(3) m(-3)), whereas custom CP calibration equations provided accurate theta(v) determinations (RMSE < 0.028 m(3) m(-3)). Even when theta(v) was overestimated, the manufacturer's default equation was able to reproduce theta(v) dynamics during irrigation. Therefore, if users are interested in relative differences in theta(v), they may use the manufacturer's default equation. If absolute values are needed, however, soil-specific calibration is required. The accuracy of CP in monitoring theta(v) under field conditions was slightly better using the laboratory calibration equation (RMSE = 0.019 m(3) m(-3)) rather than the field calibration equation (RMSE = 0.023 m(3) m(-3)). The use of a laboratory calibration is recommended given that it is easily reproducible, facilitates work planning, and minimizes uncertainties.

TI  - Application methods influence biochar-fertilizer interactive effects on soil nitrogen dynamics
T2  - SOIL SCIENCE SOCIETY OF AMERICA JOURNAL
LA  - English
AB  - The potential nitrogen (N) losses from soils with fertilizer addition can be reduced when biochar is co-applied, but this effect is influenced by the methods of biochar and fertilizer application. In a 60-d laboratory incubation experiment, we investigated how two fertilizer application methods (surface placement and soil incorporation) affected N transformation in soils under the following treatments: control (soil with no biochar and urea [C]), biochar (150 mg N g(-1) soil [B]), urea (150 mg N g(-1) soil [U]), and the combination of B + U (75 mg N g(-1) soil each B and U). Our results showed that at Day 30, the concentrations of soil NH4+-N and NO3--N remained significantly higher for U but were relatively similar to control for biochar-included treatments, indicating that the presence of biochar slowed the mineralization of urea during that period. The concentration of soil NO3--N and cumulative N2O production under B + U treatment at 60 d was around two times higher for incorporation treatment compared with the surface treatment, indicative of a longer-term N regulatory effect of biochar with the surface application method. Additionally, we observed a higher number of amoA gene transcripts when B + U was incorporated in the soil compared with applied to the surface at the later stage of incubation, indicative of higher potential nitrification activity. These results suggest that the surface application of B + U can be used as a slow release N source that can provide long-term N supply to the crops, while the soil incorporation method could be used for crops that need low N at the beginning of the growth but require a substantial amount of it later. Surface co-application of B + U can also be a good strategy to reduce soil N losses by slowing down ammonification, nitrification, N2O emission, and ammonia oxidizing bacteria activity.

AB  - Soils contribute 15%-75% of total atmospheric nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions in agricultural regions during the growing season. However, the impacts of cropland fertilizer management on spatially heterogeneous, temporally episodic NOx emission patterns are highly uncertain. We examine the effects of liquid slurry dairy manure application practices on soil NOx emissions in rainfed, corn-soybean rotations during spring 2016 and 2017. Daily soil NOx emissions and weekly soil inorganic N measurements were performed in a randomized split-split plot design for 1-4 weeks following manure applications. NOx emissions and soil N with shallow-disk injection and chisel-disk manure incorporation methods were compared with unincorporated broadcast practices. Injected manure and chisel-disk incorporation exhibited two-four times larger mean NOx emissions than those with unincorporated broadcast manure. Larger soil NOx emissions with manure incorporation practices were driven by the predominance of nitrification in these treatments with evidence of soil nitrate production. Soil NOx emission differences between treatments were detectable across order of magnitude changes in daily NOx emissions during two growing seasons. Larger soil NOx emissions associated with manure incorporation practices compared with unincorporated broadcast practices occur alongside larger N2O and smaller NH3 emissions, highlighting important air quality and climate impact tradeoffs for cropland manure fertilizer management choices.
   Soil NOx emissions were characterized following rainfed liquid dairy manure applications in the northeastern United States. Soil NOx emissions with manure incorporation were two-four times larger than with unincorporated broadcast manure. Larger soil NOx emissions with manure incorporation were associated with the predominance of nitrification.

AB  - Studies were undertaken on native and sown perennial grass-based pastures as part of the Sustainable Grazing Systems National Experiment to estimate root depth and describe root distribution in these pastures. Samples from soil cores (0 - 210 cm maximum sampling depth) taken in 1997 (before grazing treatments were imposed) and 4 years later in spring 2001 were used to examine the effects of different grazing regimes on root length density (cm/cm(3)), root mass density ( mg/cm(3)), root volume density (cm(3)/cm(3)), and diameter ( mm) at each of 3 sites. In spring 1997, mean maximum root depth was 107 cm for a native perennial grass pasture near Barraba and 74 cm for a pasture sown with phalaris (Phalaris aquatica) and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) near Nundle, with values being lower for a native pasture near Manilla (65 cm for a Brown Vertosol and 97 cm for a Red Chromosol). For all pasture types, > 20% of root mass density, root length density or root volume density was in the 0 - 5 cm soil layer and > 60% was at a depth of 0 - 30 cm. At all sites, mean total root mass was around 1000 kg DM/ha. After 4 years of grazing (spring 2001) there were relatively fewsignificant effects of grazing treatment on root length density, root mass density, root volume density, or root diameter. Effects that were significant mostly occurred at 0 - 5 cm for the native pastures and 0 - 50 cm for the sown pasture. For the Barraba native pasture, root length, volume and mass densities (0 - 5 cm) were higher (P < 0.05) in the continuously grazed, low stocking rate treatment compared with all other treatments. Similarly, for the Manilla native pasture, root length density was higher (P < 0.05) in this treatment at soil depths of 0 - 5 and > 5 - 10 cm compared with all other treatments. In contrast, for the Nundle sown pasture, root length density (0 - 5 cm) was lowest (P < 0.05) in 2 continuously grazed treatments compared with those that were strategically grazed in autumn and spring.

AB  - Potassium (K) plays an important role in growth, yield, quality, osmotic regulation, ionic balance and stress resistance of crops. Fertilizer application in Indian agriculture has remained largely skewed towards nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), while K remained neglected for over last five decades. On this background, the present study evaluates the soil K fractions under two contrasting land use systems, viz. rice-fallow and forest under three soil depths (0-15, 15-30 and 30-60 cm) and categorisation of soils based on exchangeable K (Exch-K) and non-exchangeable K (NEK) with the strategy for proper K management. Results indicated that the soils of rice-fallow land use system were present in a category which is low in both Exch-K and NEK and as a result it requires adequate K fertilization. Both Exch-K and NEK were higher in the forest soils as compared to rice-fallow soils in the three soil depths. The ratio of NEK/Exch-K was higher in the forest than rice-fallow land use system. The ratio was increased with increase in depth in the forest land use system which indicates that it has more potential to supply subsoil K in long term. This categorisation of soils into different groups provides a comprehensive assessment of K availability for different land use systems and better recommendation of K fertilizer for efficient K management.

AB  - Although models have been developed previously, a mechanistic model is needed to estimate electrical conductivity (EC) using time domain reflectometry (TDR) with variable lengths of coaxial cable. The goals of this study are to: (i) derive a mechanistic model based on multisection transmission line theory to estimate EC using TDR readings; and (ii) test this new mechanistic model with laboratory experiments of variable EC solutions and coaxial cable length, and compare the results with four previous models. A new mechanistic model was derived from the zero-frequency response of the reflection scatter function of a multisection transmission line comprised of a TDR probe, coaxial cable and cable tester to describe the relationship between EC and the steady state reflection coefficient. The length, reference impedance, and complex dielectric permittivity describe the sections in the TDR probe. Five parameters (length, series resistance, series inductance, shunt conductance and shunt capacitance) describe the coaxial cable section. The cable tester includes a coaxial cable and 50-W source impedance. The new model requires an open and a short-circuit measurement to measure the shunt conductance and series resistance of coaxial cable, respectively. An implementation model was further derived to measure EC based on the steady state reflection coefficients when the TDR probe is in air, short circuit, and test media. Experimental results showed that the measured EC values of KCl solutions were very close to the values measured by a standard conductivity meter, and without calibration the new mechanistic model performed as well as the three best calibrated models.

AB  - Overfertilization with nitrogen fertilizers has damaged the environment and health of soil, but standard laboratory testing of soil to determine the levels of nitrogen (mainly NH4+ and NO3-) is not performed regularly. Here we demonstrate that point-of-use measurements of NH4+, combined with soil conductivity, pH, easily accessible weather and timing data, allow instantaneous prediction of levels of NO3- in soil (R-2 = 0.70) using a machine learning model. A long short-term memory recurrent neural network model can also be used to predict levels of NH4+ and NO3- up to 12 days into the future from a single measurement at day one, with R-NH4+(2) -0.60 and R-NO3-(2) -0.70, for unseen weather conditions. Our machine-learning-based approach eliminates the need for dedicated instruments to determine the levels of NO3- in soil. Nitrogenous soil nutrients can be determined and predicted with enough accuracy to forecast the impact of climate on fertilization planning and to tune timing for crop requirements, reducing overfertilization while improving crop yields.

AB  - A semi-distributed hydrological model has been developed in this study for determining runoff in an ungauged peri-urban catchment of north east India. In the absence of discharge data, the study has focused on how to improve the accuracy of runoff prediction based on imperviousness determination by spatial method. The imperviousness is defined in terms of total impervious area (TIA) and effective impervious area (EIA). The study highlights misclassification as one of the factors causing error in imperviousness determination. It is recommended that integrating GIS data with high resolution satellite imagery can be an effective solution to minimise misclassification. The predicted peak runoff was 33.4% larger when GIS based imperviousness is employed in the model. The peak runoff was 72.2% more in 2006 as compared to 1980 due to an increase in imperviousness, which is attributed to urbanisation.

AB  - Soil nitrogen content is one of the important growth nutrient parameters of crops. It is a prerequisite for scientific fertilization to accurately grasp soil nutrient information in precision agriculture. The information about nutrients such as nitrogen in the soil can be obtained quickly by using a near-infrared sensor. The data can be analyzed in the detection process, which is nondestructive and non-polluting. In order to investigate the effect of soil pretreatment on nitrogen content by near infrared sensor, 16 nitrogen concentrations were mixed with soil and the soil samples were divided into three groups with different pretreatment. The first group of soil samples with strict pretreatment were dried, ground, sieved and pressed. The second group of soil samples were dried and ground. The third group of soil samples were simply dried. Three linear different modeling methods are used to analyze the spectrum, including partial least squares (PLS), uninformative variable elimination (UVE), competitive adaptive reweighted algorithm (CARS). The model of nonlinear partial least squares which supports vector machine (LS-SVM) is also used to analyze the soil reflectance spectrum. The results show that the soil samples with strict pretreatment have the best accuracy in predicting nitrogen content by near-infrared sensor, and the pretreatment method is suitable for practical application.

AB  - Proper irrigation practice consists of applying the optimum amount of water to the soil at the right time. The porous characteristics of the soil determine the capacity of the soil to absorb, infiltrate, and store water. In irrigation, it is not sufficient to only determine the water content of the soil; it is also necessary to determine the availability of water for plants: water potential. In this paper, a comprehensive laboratory evaluation-accuracy and variability-of the world's leading commercial water potential sensors is carried out. No such comprehensive and exhaustive comparative evaluation of these devices has been carried out to date. Ten pairs of representative commercial sensors from four different families were selected according to their principle of operation (tensiometers, capacitive sensors, heat dissipation sensors, and resistance blocks). The accuracy of the readings (0 kPa-200 kPa) was determined in two soils of contrasting textures. The variability in the recordings-repeatability and reproducibility-was carried out in a homogeneous and inert material (sand) in the same suction range. The response in terms of accuracy and value dispersion of the different sensor families was different according to the suction range considered. In the suction range of agronomic interest (0-100 kPa), the heat dissipation sensor and the capacitive sensors were the most accurate. In both families, registrations could be extended up to 150-200 kPa. The scatter in the readings across the different sensors was due to approximately 80% of the repeatability or intrinsic variability in the sensor unit and 20% of the reproducibility. Some sensors would significantly improve their performance with ad hoc calibrations.

AB  - Understanding the current hydro-meteorological situation is critical to manage extreme events and water resources. The United Kingdom Water Resources Portal (UKWRP) has been developed to enable dynamic, interactive access to hydro-meteorological data across the United Kingdom, including catchment daily rainfall (near), real-time daily mean river flows, groundwater levels, real-time soil moisture data, and standardised climate indices. The UKWRP offers a way of exploring the full range of river flow and rainfall variability, including comparing current conditions to those in the past, from droughts to floods. A variety of different plotting capabilities mean users can view and explore data in different ways depending on their requirements. Here we discuss the mechanisms and the engagement undertaken to develop the UKWRP, in addition to the technical issues and solutions of bringing multiple data sources and types together, how the data are processed, stored and published to deliver an integrated tool for water resources management. The UKWRP enables all water users-from farmers, to water companies to members of the general public-to view and explore the data used by regulators to manage water supplies. We demonstrate how the UKWRP can be used to monitor the hydrological situation, using recent examples of both floods and droughts, and enables consistent messaging and universal access to data and information. Finally, we discuss the decisions the information provided in the UKWRP can support, and possible future developments. The UKWRP is aimed at the United Kingdom water research and management community, but we envisage that the Portal (and the development pathway and technical solutions reported here) could provide a useful exemplar for similar systems in other international settings.

AB  - Several studies have shown that physiological responses in plants, including fruit crops, are associated with changes in electrical potentials (EP), but it is often difficult to statistically quantify these responses. This study tested the effects of irrigation on EP in grapevines (Vitis vinifera), taking into account vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and position of electrodes along the stem by using multivariate analytical methods and a suite of statistical pretreatments. In two separate experiments, plants were exposed to one of two irrigation treatments in a greenhouse: (T1) irrigation once per day (Experiment 1), or no irrigation (Experiment 2); or (T2) irrigation three times or twice per day (Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). In each experiment, EP at three positions along the stem, soil (potting medium) water content, and VPD were continuously measured. In Experiment 2, stomatal conductance (gs) and stem water potential (SWP) were also measured for plants in each irrigation treatment as indicators of plant water status. Data were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to determine the effects of irrigation treatment on EP and difference in EP between pairs of electrodes (Delta EP) at various locations along the stem. Data were also analyzed by partial least squares (PLS) analysis to determine if EP or Delta EP could be used as predictors of changes in soil water content due to different irrigation treatments. Significant differences in soil water content due to irrigation treatments could be readily detected by difference in EP or Delta EP using PCA with Orthogonal Signal Correction pre-processing. Also, PLS showed that differences in soil moisture can be predicted by EP and/or Delta EP measurements at specific locations along the stem. Thus, the use of multivariate statistical methods was effective for relating EP and Delta EP measurements in grapevines to soil moisture due to differences in irrigation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To quantitatively analyze the spatial features of a cosmic-ray sensor (CRS) (i.e., the measurement support volume of the CRS and the weight of the in situ point-scale soil water content (SWC) in terms of the regionally averaged SWC derived from the CRS) in measuring the SWC, cooperative observations based on CRS, oven drying and frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) methods are performed at the point and regional scales in a desert steppe area of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This region is flat with sparse vegetation cover consisting of only grass, thereby minimizing the effects of terrain and vegetation. Considering the two possibilities of the measurement support volume of the CRS, the results of four weighting methods are compared with the SWC monitored by FDR within an appropriate measurement support volume. The weighted average calculated using the neutron intensity-based weighting method (Ni weighting method) best fits the regionally averaged SWC measured by the CRS. Therefore, we conclude that the gyroscopic support volume and the weights determined by the Ni weighting method are the closest to the actual spatial features of the CRS when measuring the SWC. Based on these findings, a scale transformation model of the SWC from the point scale to the scale of the CRS measurement support volume is established. In addition, the spatial features simulated using the Ni weighting method are visualized by developing a software system.

AB  - Irrigation refers to supplying water to soil through pipes, pumps, and spraying systems to ensure even distribution across the field. In traditional farming or gardening, the setup and usage of an agricultural irrigation system solely rely on the personal experience of farmers. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (UN) has projected that by 2030, developing countries will expand their irrigated areas by 34%, while water consumption will only be up 14%. This discrepancy highlights the importance of accurately monitoring water flow and volume rather than people's rough estimations. The smart irrigation systems, a key subsystem of smart agriculture known as the cyber-physical system (CPS) in the agriculture domain, automate the administration of water flow, volume, and timing via using cutting-edge technologies, especially the Internet of Things (IoT) technology, to solve the challenges. This study explores a comprehensive three-dimensional problem space to thoroughly analyze the IoT's applications in irrigation systems. Our framework encompasses several critical domains in smart irrigation systems. These domains include soil science, sensor technology, communication protocols, data analysis techniques, and the practical implementations of automated irrigation systems, such as remote monitoring, autonomous operation, and intelligent decision-making processes. Finally, we discuss a few challenges and outline future research directions in this promising field.

AB  - In the human diet, particularly for most of the vegetarian population, mungbean (Vigna radiata L. Wilczek) is an inexpensive and environmentally friendly source of protein. Being a short-duration crop, mungbean fits well into different cropping systems dominated by staple food crops such as rice and wheat. Hence, knowing the growth and production pattern of this important legume under various soil moisture conditions gains paramount significance. Toward that end, 24 elite mungbean genotypes were grown with and without water stress for 25 days in a controlled environment. Top view and side view (two) images of all genotypes captured by a high-resolution camera installed in the high-throughput phenomics were analyzed to extract the pertinent parameters associated with plant features. We tested eight different multivariate models employing machine learning algorithms to predict fresh biomass from different features extracted from the images of diverse genotypes in the presence and absence of soil moisture stress. Based on the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), and R squared (R-2) values, which are used to assess the precision of a model, the partial least square (PLS) method among the eight models was selected for the prediction of biomass. The predicted biomass was used to compute the plant growth rates and water-use indices, which were found to be highly promising surrogate traits as they could differentiate the response of genotypes to soil moisture stress more effectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is perhaps the first report stating the use of a phenomics method as a promising tool for assessing growth rates and also the productive use of water in mungbean crop.

AB  - Space-based radar sensors have transformed Earth observation since their first use by Seasat in 1978. Radar instruments are less affected by daylight or weather conditions than optical counterparts, suitable for continually monitoring the global biosphere. The current trends in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) platform design are distinct from traditional approaches in that miniaturized satellites carrying SAR are launched in multiples to form a SAR constellation. A systems engineering perspective is presented in this paper to track the transitioning of space-based SAR platforms from large satellites to small satellites. Technological advances therein are analyzed in terms of subsystem components, standalone satellites, and satellite constellations. The availability of commercial satellite constellations, ground stations, and launch services together enable real-time SAR observations with unprecedented details, which will help reveal the global biomass and their changes owing to anthropogenic drivers. The possible roles of small satellites in global biospheric monitoring and the subsequent research areas are also discussed.

AB  - Data disaggregation (or downscaling) is becoming a recognized modeling framework to improve the spatial resolution of available surface soil moisture satellite products. However, depending on the quality of the scale change modeling and on the uncertainty in its input data, disaggregation may improve or degrade soil moisture information at high resolution. Hence, defining a relevant metric for evaluating such methodologies is crucial before disaggregated data can be eventually used in fine-scale studies. In this paper, a new metric, named G(DOWN), is proposed to assess the potential gain provided by disaggregation relative to the non-disaggregation case. The performance metric is tested during a four-year period by comparing 1-km resolution disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DISPATCH) data with the soil moisture measurements collected by six stations in central Morocco. DISPATCH data are obtained every 2-3 days from 40-km resolution SMOS (Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity) and 1-km resolution optical MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) data. The correlation coefficient between G(DOWN) and the disaggregation gain in time series correlation, mean bias and bias in the slope of the linear fit ranges from 0.5 to 0.8. The new metric is found to be a good indicator of the overall performance of DISPATCH. Especially, the sign of G(DOWN) (positive in the case of effective disaggregation and negative in the opposite case) is independent of the uncertainties in SMOS data and of the representativeness of localized in situ measurements at the downscaling (1 km) resolution. In contrast, the traditional root mean square difference between disaggregation output and in situ measurements is poorly correlated (correlation coefficient of about 0.0) with the disaggregation gain in terms of both time series correlation and bias in the slope of the linear fit. The G(DOWN) approach is generic and thus could help test a range of downscaling methods dedicated to soil moisture and to other geophysical variables.

AB  - We discuss a simplifed, conceptual model for the dynamics of the soil-vegetation system in drylands. The model considers the different dynamical processes taking place in vegetated and non-vegetated soil and it distinguishes between the upper soil layer, where rapid evaporation dominates, and the deeper root layer where only plant transpiration takes place. We explore the role of rainfall intermittency and of different plant colonization strategies, and discuss in detail the effect of two different vegetation feedbacks: reduced evaporation due to plant shading and increased infiltration in vegetated areas. The results of the analysis indicate that both temporal rainfall intermittency and the shading/infiltration feedbacks have a beneficial effect on vegetation. However, it turns out that in this model rainfall intermittency and vegetation feedbacks have almost a mutually exclusive role: whenever one of these two components is present, the addition of the other does not further affect vegetation dynamics in a significant way.

AB  - Data assimilation is increasingly being used to merge remotely sensed land surface variables such as soil moisture, snow, and skin temperature with estimates from land models. Its success, however, depends on unbiased model predictions and unbiased observations. Here a suite of continental-scale, synthetic soil moisture assimilation experiments is used to compare two approaches that address typical biases in soil moisture prior to data assimilation: (1) parameter estimation to calibrate the land model to the climatology of the soil moisture observations and (2) scaling of the observations to the model's soil moisture climatology. To enable this research, an optimization infrastructure was added to the NASA Land Information System (LIS) that includes gradient-based optimization methods and global, heuristic search algorithms. The land model calibration eliminates the bias but does not necessarily result in more realistic model parameters. Nevertheless, the experiments confirm that model calibration yields assimilation estimates of surface and root zone soil moisture that are as skillful as those obtained through scaling of the observations to the model's climatology. Analysis of innovation diagnostics underlines the importance of addressing bias in soil moisture assimilation and confirms that both approaches adequately address the issue.

AB  - Soil moisture is vital for the crop growth and directly affects the crop yield. The conventional synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based soil moisture monitoring is often influenced by vegetation cover and surface roughness. The machine-learning methods are not constrained by physical parameters and have high nonlinear fitting capabilities. In this study, machine-learning methods were applied to estimate soil moisture over winter wheat fields during its growing season. RADARSAT-2 data with quad polarizations and 240 sample plots in the study area were acquired and collected, respectively. In addition to the four linear polarization channels, polarimetric decomposition parameters were extracted to expand the SAR feature space. Three advanced machine-learning models were selected and compared, which were support vector regression, random forests (RF), and gradient boosting regression tree. To improve the performances of the models, three feature-selection methods were compared, which were based on Pearson correlation, support vector machine recursive feature elimination, and RF, respectively. The coefficient of determination (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) were used to compare and assess the performances of those models. The results revealed that polarimetric decomposition parameters were effective in estimating soil moisture, and RF model obtained the highest prediction accuracy (training set: RMSE = 2.44 vol.% and R-2 = 0.94; and validation set: RMSE = 4.03 vol.%, and R-2 = 0.79). This study finally concluded that using polarimetric decomposition parameters combined with machine-learning and feature-selection methods could effectively estimate soil moisture at a high accuracy, which helps monitor soil moisture across the agricultural field during its growing season.

AB  - Time series modeling and forecasting play important roles in many practical fields. A good understanding of soil water content and salinity variability and the proper prediction of variations in these variables in response to changes in climate conditions are essential to properly plan water resources and appropriately manage irrigation and fertilization tasks. This paper provides a 48-h forecast of soil water content and salinity in the peculiar context of irrigation with reclaimed water in semi-arid environments. The forecasting was performed based on (i) soil water content and salinity data from 50 cm beneath the soil surface with a time resolution of 15 min, (ii) hourly atmospheric data and (iii) daily irrigation amounts. Exploratory data analysis and data pre-processing phases were performed and then statistical models were constructed for time series forecasting based on the set of available data. The obtained prediction models showed good forecasting accuracy and good interpretability of the results.

AB  - Soil moisture data can reflect valuable information on soil properties, terrain features, and drought condition. The current study compared and assessed the performance of different interpolation methods for estimating soil moisture in an area with complex topography in southwest China. The approaches were inverse distance weighting, multifarious forms of kriging, regularized spline with tension, and thin plate spline. The 5-day soil moisture observed at 167 stations and daily temperature recorded at 33 stations during the period of 2010-2014 were used in the current work. Model performance was tested with accuracy indicators of determination coefficient (R-2), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and modeling efficiency (ME). The results indicated that inverse distance weighting had the best performance with R2, MAPE, RMSE, RRMSE, and ME of 0.32, 14.37, 13.02%, 0.16, and 0.30, respectively. Based on the best method, a spatial database of soil moisture was developed and used to investigate drought condition over the study area. The results showed that the distribution of drought was characterized by evidently regional difference. Besides, drought mainly occurred in August and September in the 5 years and was prone to happening in the western and central parts rather than in the northeastern and southeastern areas.

AB  - Model parameters are a source of uncertainty that can easily cause systematic deviation and significantly affect the accuracy of soil moisture generation in assimilation systems. This study addresses the issue of retrieving model parameters related to soil moisture via the simultaneous estimation of states and parameters based on the Common Land Model (CoLM). The state-parameter estimation algorithms AEnKF (Augmented Ensemble Kalman Filter), DEnKF (Dual Ensemble Kalman Filter) and SODA (Simultaneous optimization and data assimilation) are entirely implemented within an EnKF framework to investigate how the three algorithms can correct model parameters and improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimation. The analysis is illustrated by assimilating the surface soil moisture levels from varying observation intervals using data from Mongolian plateau sites. Furthermore, a radiation transfer model is introduced as an observation operator to analyze the influence of brightness temperature assimilation on states and parameters that are estimated at different microwave signal frequencies. Three cases were analyzed for both soil moisture and brightness temperature assimilation, focusing on the progressive incorporation of parameter uncertainty, forcing data uncertainty and model uncertainty. It has been demonstrated that EnKF is outperformed by all other methods, as it consistently maintains a bias. State-parameter estimation algorithms can provide a more accurate estimation of soil moisture than EnKF. AEnKF is the most robust method, with the lowest RMSE values for retrieving states and parameters dealing only with parameter uncertainty, but it possesses disadvantages related to increasing sources of uncertainty and decreasing numbers of observations. SODA performs well under the complex situations in which DEnKF shows slight disadvantages in terms of statistical indicators: however, the former consumes far more memory and time than the latter.

AB  - Microwave remote sensing is able to retrieve soil moisture (SM) at an adequate level of accuracy. However, these microwave remotely sensed SM products usually have a spatial resolution of tens of kilometers which cannot satisfy the requirements of fine to medium scale applications such as agricultural irrigation and local water resource management. Several SM downscaling methods have been proposed to solve this mismatch by downscaling the coarse-scale SM to fine-scale (several kilometers or hundreds of meters). Although studies have been conducted over different climatic zones and from different data sets with good results, there is still a lack of a comprehensive comparison and evaluation between them to guide the production of high-resolution and high-accuracy SM data. Therefore, in this study we compared several SM downscaling methods (from 0.25 degrees to 0.01 degrees) based on polynormal fitting, physical model, machine learning and geostatistics over the Qinghai-Tibet plateau where there is a wide range of climate conditions from four aspects, that is, comparison with the original microwave product, comparison with in situ measurements, inter-comparison based on three-cornered hat (TCH) method, and a spatial feasibility analysis. The comparison results show that the method based on a physical model, in this case the Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) method, has the highest ability on preserving the coarse-scale feature of original microwave SM product, while to some extent, this ability could be a disadvantage for improving the accuracy of the downscaling results. In addition, soil evaporation efficiency (SEE) alone is not sufficient to represent SM spatial patterns over complex land surface. Geostatistics based area-to-area regression Kriging (ATARK) introduces the highest uncertainty caused by the overcorrection during the residual interpolation process while this process can also improve correlation (R) and correct the bias as well as provide more feasible spatial patterns and details. Two machine learning methods, the random forest (RF) and Gaussian process regression (GPR) show high stability on all comparison results but provide smoother spatial patterns. The multivariate statistical regression (MSR) method performs worst due to the fact that its simple linear regression model could not meet the requirement of SM fitting on complicated land surface. Moreover, all five downscaling methods show a declining accuracy after downscaling. This phenomenon may be caused by the spatial mismatch on fine-scale. In addition, this could also be caused by the tendency that downscaled results will usually provide more spatial details from downscaling predictors, while they cannot capture the temporal changes of the microwave SM product well. In general, this phenomenon tends to be more significant over heterogeneous land surface. All in all, five widely used soil moisture downscaling methods were compared based on a comprehensive comparison scheme to add to the body of knowledge in applicability of downcaling methods under different weather conditions.

AB  - Soil volumetric water content (VWC) is a vital parameter to understand several ecohydrological and environmental processes. Its cost-effective measurement can potentially drive various technological tools to promote data-driven sustainable agriculture through supplemental irrigation solutions, the lack of which has contributed to severe agricultural distress, particularly for smallholder farmers. The cost of commercially available VWC sensors varies over four orders of magnitude. A laboratory study characterizing and testing sensors from this wide range of cost categories, which is a prerequisite to explore their applicability for irrigation management, has not been conducted. Within this context, two low-cost capacitive sensors-SMEC300 and SM100-manufactured by Spectrum Technologies Inc. (Aurora, IL, USA), and two very low-cost resistive sensors-the Soil Hygrometer Detection Module Soil Moisture Sensor (YL100) by Electronicfans and the Generic Soil Moisture Sensor Module (YL69) by KitsGuru-were tested for performance in laboratory conditions. Each sensor was calibrated in different repacked soils, and tested to evaluate accuracy, precision and sensitivity to variations in temperature and salinity. The capacitive sensors were additionally tested for their performance in liquids of known dielectric constants, and a comparative analysis of the calibration equations developed in-house and provided by the manufacturer was carried out. The value for money of the sensors is reflected in their precision performance, i.e., the precision performance largely follows sensor costs. The other aspects of sensor performance do not necessarily follow sensor costs. The low-cost capacitive sensors were more accurate than manufacturer specifications, and could match the performance of the secondary standard sensor, after soil specific calibration. SMEC300 is accurate (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 2.12%, 2.88% and 0.28 respectively), precise, and performed well considering its price as well as multi-purpose sensing capabilities. The less-expensive SM100 sensor had a better accuracy (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 1.67%, 2.36% and 0.21 respectively) but poorer precision than the SMEC300. However, it was established as a robust, field ready, low-cost sensor due to its more consistent performance in soils (particularly the field soil) and superior performance in fluids. Both the capacitive sensors responded reasonably to variations in temperature and salinity conditions. Though the resistive sensors were less accurate and precise compared to the capacitive sensors, they performed well considering their cost category. The YL100 was more accurate (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 3.51%, 5.21% and 0.37 respectively) than YL69 (MAE, RMSE, and RAE of 4.13%, 5.54%, and 0.41, respectively). However, YL69 outperformed YL100 in terms of precision, and response to temperature and salinity variations, to emerge as a more robust resistive sensor. These very low-cost sensors may be used in combination with more accurate sensors to better characterize the spatiotemporal variability of field scale soil moisture. The laboratory characterization conducted in this study is a prerequisite to estimate the effect of low- and very low-cost sensor measurements on the efficiency of soil moisture based irrigation scheduling systems.

AB  - Soil moisture sensors can be effective and promising decision-making tools for diverse applications and audiences, including agricultural managers, irrigation practitioners, and researchers. Nevertheless, there exists immense adoption potential in the United States, with only 1.2 in 10 farms nationally using soil moisture sensors to decide when to irrigate. This number is much lower in the global scale. Increased adoption is likely hindered by lack of scientific support in need assessment, selection, suitability and use of these sensors. Here, through extensive field research, we address the operational feasibility of soil moisture sensors, an aspect which has been overlooked in the past, and integrate it with their performance accuracy, in order to develop a quantitative framework to guide users in the selection of best-suited sensors for varying applications. These evaluations were conducted for nine commercially available sensors under silt loam and loamy sand soils in irrigated cropland and rainfed grassland for two different installation orientations [sensing component parallel (horizontal) and perpendicular (vertical) to the ground surface] typically used. All the sensors were assessed for their aptness in terms of cost, ease of operation, convenience of telemetry, and performance accuracy. Best sensors under each soil condition, sensor orientation, and user applications (research versus agricultural production) were identified. The step-by-step guide presented here will serve as an unprecedented and holistic adoption-assisting resource and can be extended to other sensors as well.

AB  - Climate change and recurring mid-season dry spells have resulted in perennial droughts and poor yields in most smallholder farming areas located in marginal arid to semi-arid lands (ASAL) of Zimbabwe where they are dependent on rainwater for agricultural crop production. One approach that can be used to adapt to changing climatic pattern is in-field water harvesting. This study evaluated the soil profile water content and maize yields of 3 infield water harvesting technologies namely infiltration pits (IF), fanya juus (FJ) and contour ridges with cross ties (CRCT) in comparison to standard contour ridges (SC). The three systems are currently the focus of extension recommendations for water conservation in semi-arid regions of the country. Soil water content was measured on a regular basis using gravimetric methods at locations upslope and down slope of each structure. The average volumetric water content was signifcantly different between treatments, and it varied with increasing distance from the water harvesting structures. The average profile soil moisture content, over the three seasons were 8.3, 8.2, 8.1 and 7.8% for CRCT, FJ, IF and SC repectively. CRCT, FJ and IF retained more water for a greater distance from the harvesting structures compared to the SC. Maize yields were significantly higher in the water harvesting technologies compared to SC. Maize yields were 1196, 1164, 1250 and 749 kg ha(-1) for CRCT, FJ, IF and SC respectively. There as a good correlation between water content and maize yields (R-2 = 0.80). It was concluded that improved water harvesting structures when compared to SC have the potential to increase maize yields in areas with water shortages, hence they can be a useful strategy for climate change adaptation.

AB  - Automated software tools are required to undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation. A key issue in this topic is how to integrate sensors in the scheduling approach. The objectives of this research were to test, in the context of drip-irrigated orchards: (a) the suitability of FAOs water balance method, locally adjusted by sensors, as the basis for the scheduling algorithm, (b) the suitability of capacitance-type soil moisture sensors, and an approach for their automated interpretation, for providing feedback to the scheduling algorithm, and (c) the performance of these combined approaches in the autonomous scheduling of irrigation in an apple orchard with heterogeneous vigour. The trial consisted of applying for two years the proposed approaches using an experimental web application, IRRIX, which scheduled irrigation of two irrigation sectors, which differed in tree size. The automated system was compared with manual scheduling by a classical water balance and with the actual evapotranspiration determined by a weighing lysimeter located in the same orchard. Results show that the irrigation applied by the automated approach in the sector of larger trees agreed with the ET determined by the lysimeter and, overall, with the scheduling by an experienced irrigator using a classical water balance. Meanwhile, as a result of a different feedback from soil moisture sensors, the same system reduced irrigation in the sector of smaller trees by a similar amount to that expected from the differences between the two sectors in the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation. This study illustrates that the method of water balance complemented with capacitance-type soil moisture sensors provides a sound basis for automated irrigation scheduling in orchards.

AB  - Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate measurements of in situ soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling of geophysical processes, perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for societal benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable for real -time or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time -intensive procedures. In other words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not very feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number of in -situ observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the remote sensing-based products that require sampling in a narrow time window during satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that measure soil moisture instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil moisture sensors usually operate on the principle of dielectric characterization of the soil and water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture, these sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available in the scientific literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity of calibration, and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use in field studies. In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration protocols has been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration method based on the sensor type, soil type, and environmental conditions is highlighted in this review. We also examine various calibration methods, including traditional equations based on linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as the nonlinear approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for regular calibration and maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure accurate and reliable data is also emphasized. The review concludes by providing recommendations for selecting the appropriate calibration method/approach for dielectric soil moisture sensors to achieve the required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this review provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of dielectric sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management.

AB  - Remote sensing-based estimation of soil moisture is crucial in many aspects including basin scale water resource management, irrigation scheduling, regional scale drought monitoring and crop yield forecasting. In this study, we evaluate the potential of visible/thermal-infrared remote sensing in soil moisture estimation, by assessing the TVDI-based method and three categories of methods based on evaporative fraction/potential evaporation ratio (EFM1, EFM2 and EFM3). In combination with ASTER data set, soil moisture in middle reach of the Heihe River Basin is predicted by the above-mentioned four methods and validated by the ground-based measurements from eco-hydrological wireless sensor network and hydro meteorological observation network in the middle reach of Heihe river basin. Results indicate that uncertainties arise from the empiricism of the TVDI-based method in the process of determining dry and wet edges. On the other hand, the evaporation fraction/potential evaporation ratio methods can to some degree reduce the uncertainties, and among the three methods, EFM1 and EFM3 outperform EFM2. In addition, the thermal-infrared based methods require accurate soil parameters to reproduce the variation of soil moisture.

AB  - In this study, the feasibility of the resistivity method for the study of the spatial and temporal soil moisture variations in the Vallaccia catchment (central Italy), covering an area of about 56 km(2), was investigated. Correlation and regression analyses were performed over a 1 year data set of simultaneous soil electrical resistivity and soil moisture measurements, acquired in eight different sites with a Resistivimeter Syscal Junior and a portable Time Domain Reflectometer (TDR), respectively. Measurements acquired in-time by continuous Frequency Domain Reflectometer (FDR) sensors were also used and compared with simultaneous resistivity measurements. The statistical analyses were conducted not only for the whole data set, but also separately for each sampling day, for each sampling site and considering spatially averaged data. Results showed a good correlation between resistivity and soil moisture measurements, revealing the capability of resistivity measurements to infer soil moisture spatial and temporal variability with a root mean square error equal, on average, to 4.4% vol/vol. In comparison with TDR, the resistivity method gives information integrated on a greater volume of soil and the measurements are easier and quicker to be carried out. Therefore, this method can be considered as an alternative tool to be employed for qualitative and quantitative soil moisture monitoring in small to medium catchments. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Continuous time series of soil moisture data are important for water resource applications including streamflow predictions and weather forecasting. In practice, most soil moisture data have missing values which require infilling to generate complete datasets. This study investigates six methods for infilling missing values for high resolution soil moisture data. This includes multiple linear regression (MLR), weighted Pearson correlation coefficient (WPCC), station relative difference (SRD), soil layer relative difference (SLRD), monthly average replacement (MAR), and merged method. Hourly soil moisture and meteorological data at four different sites, each with nine soil moisture stations located in Halton and Hamilton conservation areas in southern Ontario, Canada were used to evaluate the accuracy levels of the six selected methods.
   The results showed that the merged method consistently provides the highest evaluation accuracy across all sites. An appealing property of the merged method is its capability to incorporate multiple estimates of missing soil moisture value from other methods. The decreasing order of performance for remaining methods is MAR, SLRD, SRD, MLR and WPCC. The MAR is a simple method but it performed better than complex methods such as MLR and WPCC. Both SRD and SLRD employ the concept of rank stability of soil moisture but SLRD is preferred to SRD - suggesting that similar soil layer at different spatial locations, opposed to temporal persistence of soil moisture in the vertical soil column, is a better predictor of missing soil moisture data. That means, it is more accurate to predict a missing soil moisture at a location using other locations' soil moisture at a similar depth, than to use soil moisture at a certain depth to predict deeper or shallower soil moisture at the same location.

AB  - Currently, many satellite data are used to invert soil moisture. However, there is no study about quantitative evaluation of observation capability of GF-1 wide field of view (WFV) sensors for soil moisture inversion. Therefore, we proposed a method to evaluate it. We used WFV, Landsat8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data to invert soil moistures in Wuhan from September 2013 to September 2014 based on the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI) and modified PDI (MPDI). From the estimated results, the R-2 values, and standard error, we found that both the PDI and MPDI had a significantly negative linear correlation with soil moisture (P < 0.01). Through the values of R, mean absolute error, mean relative error, and root mean square error, we found that a strong relativity existed between the estimated and observed soil moistures. It was evident from the results for the WFV, OLI, and MODIS that the performances of WFV and OLI were consistent and that WFV performed better than MODIS. All the results indicated that WFV sensors had a high observation capability for soil moisture inversion in Wuhan. The comprehensive evaluation results for the performance of the PDI and MPDI proved that the MPDI performed better for soil moisture inversion than did the PDI.

AB  - Rock moisture in the vadose zone, while recognized as important, is rarely monitored-in part because adequate instrumentation and installation techniques are lacking. The objectives of this work were (a) to test the applicability of a commercially available capacitance soil moisture sensor (EC-5, METER Group) for continuously monitoring the water content of weathered limestone; and (b) to contrast the water dynamics of rock matrix with that of rock fractures. At a site in the Edwards Plateau, Texas, we developed a protocol for installing sensors in limestone pits and tested its effectiveness in reducing erroneous readings caused by installation-induced preferential flow along pit walls. Our results show that rock moisture can be accurately measured with EC-5 sensors, provided some steps are taken to ensure the quality of the installation. These include protecting the sensors by installing them in horizontal shafts rather than on the exposed pit wall, and use of a sealant. Data gathered over 7 mo after installation showed that rock moisture increased significantly only after a 95-mm rainfall event. Because of preferential flow, fractures reached peak water content within 2-3 h after peak rainfall-a response that was one to two orders of magnitude faster than in rock matrix. Limestone stored 40-70% of the water after the 95-mm event, and its water content decreased significantly during summer months. Overall, our results attest to the importance of continuously measuring rock moisture in regions with shallow soils, where it serves as a critical reservoir for vegetation.

AB  - Soil organic C (SOC) and soil moisture (SM) affect the agricultural productivity of soils. For sustainable food production, knowledge of the horizontal as well as vertical variability of SOC and SM at field scale is crucial. Machine learning models using depth-related data from multiple electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensors and a gamma-ray spectrometer can provide insights into this variability of SOC and SM. In this work, we applied weighted conditioned Latin hypercube sampling to calculate 25 representative soil profile locations based on geophysical measurements on the surveyed agricultural field, for sampling and modeling. Ten additional random profiles were used for independent model validation. Soil samples were taken from four equal depth increments of 15 cm each. These were used to approximate polynomial and exponential functions to reproduce the vertical trends of SOC and SM as soil depth functions. We modeled the function coefficients of the soil depth functions spatially with Cubist and random forests with the geophysical measurements as environmental covariates. The spatial prediction of the depth functions provides three-dimensional (3D) maps of the field scale. The main findings are (a) the 3D models of SOC and SM had low errors; (b) the polynomial function provided better results than the exponential function, as the vertical trends of SOC and SM did not decrease uniformly; and (c) the spatial prediction of SOC and SM with Cubist provided slightly lower error than with random forests. Hence, we recommend modeling the second-degree polynomial with Cubist for 3D prediction of SOC and SM at field scale.

AB  - Commercial soil moisture sensors have been widely applied into the measurement of soil moisture content. However, the accuracy of such sensors varies due to the employed techniques and working conditions. In this study, the temperature impact on the soil moisture sensor reading was firstly analyzed. Next, a pioneer study on the data-driven calibration of soil moisture sensor was investigated considering the impacts of temperature. Different data-driven models including the multivariate adaptive regression splines and the Gaussian process regression were applied into the development of the calibration method. To verify the efficacy of the proposed methods, tests on four commercial soil moisture sensors were conducted; these sensors belong to the frequency domain reflection (FDR) type. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed methods can greatly improve the measurement accuracy for the investigated sensors.

AB  - Among the algorithms used for the retrieval of SMC from microwave sensors (both active, such as Synthetic Aperture Radar-SAR, and passive, radiometers), the artificial neural networks (ANN) represent the best compromise between accuracy and computation speed. ANN based algorithms have been developed at IFAC, and adapted to several radar and radiometric satellite-sensors, in order to generate SMC products at a resolution varying from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers according to the spatial scale of each sensor.
   These algorithms, which are based on the ANN techniques for inverting theoretical and semi-empirical models, have been adapted to the C- to Ka- band acquisitions from spaceborne radiometers (AMSR-E/AMSR-2), SAR (Envisat/ASAR, Cosmo-SkyMed) and real aperture radar (MetOP ASCAT).
   Large datasets of co-located satellite acquisitions and direct SMC measurements on several test sites worldwide have been used along with simulations derived from forward electromagnetic models for setting up, training and validating these algorithms. An overall quality assessment of the obtained results in terms of accuracy and computational cost was carried out, and the main advantages and limitations for an operational use of these algorithms were evaluated.
   This technique allowed the retrieval of SMC from both active and passive satellite systems, with accuracy values of about 0.05 m(3)/m(3) of SMC or better, thus making these applications compliant with the usual accuracy-requirements for SMC products from space.

AB  - Soils ranging in texture from sand to clay were used to compare permittivity measurements made using a Surface Capacitance Insertion Probe (SCIP) and time domain reflectometer (TDR). Measurements were made using the same electrodes embedded in each soil, making the measurements directly comparable. The objective of the work was to test a model describing the frequency response of the SCIP to both permittivity and electrode conductance, and to compare results with TDR and network analyzer measurements. The model was tested using liquids of known permittivity and in saline, dielectric solutions. Surface Capacitance Insertion Probe and TDR determined permittivity values are similar for sandy soils but diverge for loam and clay soils. Using Topp's values as a reference, the SCIP-determined permittivities for loams and clays lay close to the curve at water contents < 0.25 m(3) m(-3), then often rose above the curve with increasing water content. Surface Capacitance Insertion Probe permittivity correction, using electrical conductivity (EC) measured at 1 kHz, corrected the results in sands reasonably well but not enough in loams and clays for reliable calibration. We propose three possible reasons for the higher than expected permittivity values observed using the SCIP: (i) higher than expected real permittivity created by dielectric dispersion, (ii) a large contribution of the imaginary permittivity due to relaxation processes assumed to be negligible, and (iii) poor model prediction of permittivity due to excessive damping of the oscillator circuit with high EC and dielectric losses. Results from network analyzer measurements for one of the clay soils were used to aid data interpretation. The TDR measurements were much more consistent, producing apparent relative permittivity values below those of the Topp curve for the finer textured soils.

AB  - Information about the spatiotemporal variability of soil moisture is critical for many purposes, including monitoring of hydrologic extremes, irrigation scheduling, and prediction of agricultural yields. We evaluated the temporal dynamics of 18 state-of-the-art (quasi-)global near-surface soil moisture products, including six based on satellite retrievals, six based on models without satellite data assimilation (referred to hereafter as "open-loop" models), and six based on models that assimilate satellite soil moisture or brightness temperature data. Seven of the products are introduced for the first time in this study: one multi-sensor merged satellite product called MeMo (Merged soil Moisture) and six estimates from the HBV (Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning) model with three precipitation inputs (ERA5, IMERG, and MSWEP) with and without assimilation of SMAPL3E satellite retrievals, respectively. As reference, we used in situ soil moisture measurements between 2015 and 2019 at 5 cm depth from 826 sensors, located primarily in the USA and Europe. The 3-hourly Pearson correlation (R) was chosen as the primary performance metric. We found that application of the Soil Wetness Index (SWI) smoothing filter resulted in improved performance for all satellite products. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the four single-sensor satellite products was SMAPL3E(SWI), SMOSSWI, AMSR2(SWI), and ASCAT(SWI), with the L-band-based SMAPL3ESWI (median R of 0.72) outperforming the others at 50% of the sites. Among the two multi-sensor satellite products (MeMo and ESA-CCISWI), MeMo performed better on average (median R of 0.72 versus 0.67), probably due to the inclusion of SMAPL3ESWI. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the six openloop models was HBV-MSWEP, HBV-ERA5, ERA5-Land, HBV-IMERG, VIC-PGF, and GLDAS-Noah. This ranking largely reflects the quality of the precipitation forcing. HBV-MSWEP (median R of 0.78) performed best not just among the open-loop models but among all products. The calibration of HBV improved the median R by C0 :12 on average compared to random parameters, highlighting the importance of model calibration. The best-to-worst performance ranking of the six models with satellite data assimilation was HBV-MSWEP+SMAPL3E, HBV-ERA5+SMAPL3E, GLEAM, SMAPL4, HBV-IMERG+SMAPL3E, and ERA5. The assimilation of SMAPL3E retrievals into HBV-IMERG improved the median R by C0:06, suggesting that data assimilation yields significant benefits at the global scale.

AB  - Capacitance probes are soil water monitoring device that have the advantages of high accuracy, low cost and ease of automation of data acquisition. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of temperature and to evaluate soil water measurement capability of a newly developed capacitance probes (HydraSCOUT). Undisturbed soil core samples were de-aired and saturated in a vacuum chamber at a suction pressure of -70 kPa. At saturation, the probes were inserted into the soil core, thereafter it was left to drain. The results shows that the response of the sensors of the capacitance probes at constant water content to temperature can be classified into 3 different stages: Constant stage (between 15 degrees C and 38 degrees C), with no temperature effect on the readings; Falling stage (between 3 degrees C and <= 15 degrees C), where the readings declined with temperature; Erratic stage (2 degrees C to <= 3 degrees C), where the readings had no pattern. Volumetric water contents were plotted against the sensors readings to develop calibration equations. Results indicated that calibration functions developed for the soils were linear (Clay loam) and polynomial (Sandy loam). Volumetric water content was well predicted with the soil specific equation for clay loam (RMSE of 0.001 m(3) m(3) and D-index of 0.99) and Sandy loam (RMSE of 0.001 m(3) m(3) and D-index of 0.99) soil textural classes. It was recommended that the soil specific laboratory calibration equations developed during this study should be used especially, for the Sandy loam soil type, in a situation where many probes are in use.

AB  - Without fertilization, harvest of perennial bioenergy cropping systems diminishes soil nutrient stocks, yet the time course of nutrient drawdown has not often been investigated. We analyzed phosphorus (P) inputs (fertilization and atmospheric deposition) and outputs (harvest and leaching losses) over 7 years in three representative biomass crops-switchgrass (Panicum virgatum L.), miscanthus (Miscanthus x giganteus) and hybrid poplar trees (Populus nigra x P. maximowiczii)-as well as in no-till corn (maize; Zea mays L.) for comparison, all planted on former cropland in SW Michigan, USA. Only corn received P fertilizer. Corn (grain and stover), switchgrass, and miscanthus were harvested annually, while poplar was harvested after 6 years. Soil test P (STP; Bray-1 method) was measured in the upper 25 cm of soil annually. Harvest P removal was calculated from tissue P concentration and harvest yield (or annual woody biomass accrual in poplar). Leaching was estimated as total dissolved P concentration in soil solutions sampled beneath the rooting depth (1.25 m), combined with hydrological modeling. Fertilization and harvest were by far the dominant P budget terms for corn, and harvest P removal dominated the P budgets in switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar, while atmospheric deposition and leaching losses were comparatively insignificant. Because of significant P removal by harvest, the P balances of switchgrass, miscanthus, and poplar were negative and corresponded with decreasing STP, whereas P fertilization compensated for the harvest P removal in corn, resulting in a positive P balance. Results indicate that perennial crop harvest without P fertilization removed legacy P from soils, and continued harvest will soon draw P down to limiting levels, even in soils once heavily P-fertilized. Widespread cultivation of bioenergy crops may, therefore, alter P balances in agricultural landscapes, eventually requiring P fertilization, which could be supplied by P recovery from harvested biomass.

AB  - Purpose A long-term no-till study was conducted to determine whether offseason intercropping systems with maize as the cash crop increase crop straw inputs and the yield of soybean as the main crop and alter soil P dynamics compared with monocropped offseason maize. Methods The experiment was conducted between 2019 and 2021 in a randomized complete block design with four replications and four cropping systems in the offseason (fall-winter): maize alone; maize + palisade grass (U. brizantha); maize + sunn hemp (C. spectabilis); and maize + palisade grass + sunn hemp. Leaf P content, crop straw, and soybean and maize yields were analyzed, and chemical P fractionation was performed at soil depths of 0-0.05, 0.05-0.1, and 0.1-0.2 m. Results The intercropping systems affected the labile and moderately labile P pools at a depth of 0-0.05 m. On average, the intercropping systems decreased soil inorganic P (Pi) extracted by anion exchange resin (PiAER) by 26% compared with monocropped maize. In addition, the intercropping systems increased moderately labile organic P (Po) while simultaneously reducing the Pi pool. Intercropping palisade grass and/or sunn hemp with maize increased the depletion of labile and moderately labile Pi pools due to higher plant P demand driven by plant biomass. On the other hand, higher root exudates and root detritus enhanced the accumulation of moderately labile organic P under highly weathered soils. Intercropping palisade grass enhanced the yield of the main crop, i.e., soybean, but limited maize yield, presumably by creating an insufficient N supply for maize.

AB  - An understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of soil water extraction by trees in agroforestry systems has long been seen as an important step towards understanding their functioning. Traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring have been employed with some success but limitations in utilising them efficiently across both time and space have led to restrictions in their use. An electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique has been evaluated and used to study the patterns of soil water extraction from a Grey Vertosol in fallow or cropped fields alongside a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak near Warra, Qld (26.93 degrees S, 150.93 degrees E). This technique provides methods for minimising error caused by seasonal variations in temperature and the vertical distributions of both soil water and temperature. The calibration developed in this study was successful in describing the observed variations in total soil moisture in the surface 0.9m of the soil pro. le (R-2 = 0.93, s.e.= 15.3 mm). We conclude that EMI techniques can provide a quick and efficient means for monitoring soil moisture patterns in agroforestry systems when employed under suitable conditions. This paper describes the techniques developed and where they may be employed, the type of information available from the approach, and the likely methods for employing EMI approaches in a wider range of situations.

AB  - Competition for water among multiple tree rooting systems is investigated using a soil-plant model that accounts for soil moisture dynamics and root water uptake (RWU), whole plant transpiration, and leaf-level photosynthesis. The model is based on a numerical solution to the 3D Richards equation modified to account for a 3D RWU, trunk xylem, and stomatal conductances. The stomatal conductance is determined by combining a conventional biochemical demand formulation for photosynthesis with an optimization hypothesis that selects stomatal aperture so as to maximize carbon gain for a given water loss. Model results compare well with measurements of soil moisture throughout the rooting zone, of total sap flow in the trunk xylem, as well as of leaf water potential collected in a Loblolly pine forest. The model is then used to diagnose plant responses to water stress in the presence of competing rooting systems. Unsurprisingly, the overlap between rooting zones is shown to enhance soil drying. However, the 3D spatial model yielded transpiration-bulk root-zone soil moisture relations that do not deviate appreciably from their proto-typical form commonly assumed in lumped eco-hydrological models. The increased overlap among rooting systems primarily alters the timing at which the point of incipient soil moisture stress is reached by the entire soil-plant system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Spectroscopy has been applied in monitoring soil nutrient concentrations. Two types of soil samples, sandy loam and silty loam, were selected as the research objects. The UV-visible near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy data and total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), available potassium (FK), and slowly available potassium (SK) concentrations were measured. We compared the prediction results within and between two different types of soil with regard to the soil nutrient concentrations using four modeling methods, which were principal component regression (PCR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), least squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), and back propagation neural network (BPNN) models. In the prediction results within a given type of soil, LS-SVM and PLSR had better stability. In the prediction results of different types of soil, BPNN and LS-SVM had a high accuracy in most soil nutrient concentrations. By comparing different modeling methods, this study provides a basis for the subsequent selection of suitable models based on spectral technology to establish various soil nutrient models.

AB  - Irrigation is the only source of soil water in greenhouse cultivation. The objective of this study is to illustrate the differences in soil organic nitrogen mineralisation caused by irrigation volume and frequency, and provide theoretical bases for the process of nitrogen transformation and nitrogen fertiliser application under different irrigation methods. The soil nitrogen mineralisation process was studied by the long-term intermittent leaching aerobic incubation method which was used by Standford and Smith in 1972. Parameters of soil nitrogen mineralisation potential (N-0), the mineralisation rate constant (k) and half-life period (t(1/2)) in different soil layers were studied in greenhouse tomato cultivation for seven years, irrigated in three ways: subsurface irrigation (SI), drip irrigation (DI) and furrow irrigation (FI). The results showed that the first-order reaction kinetic model N-t = N-0[1 - exp(-kt)] can be used to predict the soil organic nitrogen mineralisation characteristics in a greenhouse. There were five soil layers (0-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-40 and 40-50 cm) in this study. In 0-20 cm soil layers, the N-0 value of DI was highest, then FI, and SI was lowest. Apart from 10 to 20 cm soil layer, the k values of SI and DI were higher than for FI in other soil layers, while the t(1/2) value of FI was highest, then DI, and t(1/2) of SI was the lowest. The main reasons were that large amounts of water in FI would lead to increased soil bulk density and reduced soil temperature. DI with property ratio of the temperature and moisture was beneficial to organic nitrogen mineralisation. For SI, due to the overall upward movement of water for many years, nitrate accumulated and the pH value decreased in 0-20 cm soil layers. DI could increase the proportion of N-0 value to the soil's total nitrogen. Therefore, according to the results of this study, DI gives the best effect on soil fertility, followed by SI and then by FI.

AB  - The volumetric water content (VWC) of soil is a critical parameter in agriculture, as VWC strongly influences crop yield, provides nutrients to plants, and maintains the microbes that are needed for the biological health of the soil. Measuring VWC is difficult, as it is spatially and temporally heterogeneous, and most agricultural producers use point measurements that cannot fully capture this parameter. Electrical conductivity (EC) is another soil parameter that is useful in agriculture, since it can be used to indicate soil salinity, soil texture, and plant nutrient availability. Soil EC is also very heterogeneous; measuring EC using conventional soil sampling techniques is very time consuming and often fails to capture the variability in EC at a site. In contrast to the point-based methods used to measure VWC and EC, multispectral data acquired with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) can cover large areas with high resolution. In agriculture, multispectral data are often used to calculate vegetation indices (VIs). In this research UAV-acquired VIs and raw multispectral data were used to predict soil VWC and EC. High-resolution geophysical methods were used to acquire more than 41,000 measurements of VWC and 8000 measurements of EC in 18 traverses across a field that contained 56 experimental plots. The plots varied by crop type (corn, soybeans, and alfalfa) and drainage (no drainage, moderate drainage, high drainage). Machine learning was performed using the random forest method to predict VWC and EC using VIs and multispectral data. Prediction accuracy was determined for several scenarios that assumed different levels of knowledge about crop type or drainage. Results showed that multispectral data improved prediction of VWC and EC, and the best predictions occurred when both the crop type and degree of drainage were known, but drainage was a more important input than crop type. Predictions were most accurate in drier soil, which may be due to the lower overall variability of VWC and EC under these conditions. An analysis of which multispectral data were most important showed that NDRE, VARI, and blue band data improved predictions the most. The final conclusions of this study are that inexpensive UAV-based multispectral data can be used to improve estimation of heterogenous soil properties, such as VWC and EC in active agricultural fields. In this study, the best estimates of these properties were obtained when the agriculture parameters in a field were fairly homogeneous (one crop type and the same type of drainage throughout the field), although improvements were observed even when these conditions were not met. The multispectral data that were most useful for prediction were those that penetrated deeper into the soil canopy or were sensitive to bare soil.

AB  - Plant breeders are increasing yields and improving agronomic traits in several perennial grain crops, the first of which is now being incorporated into commercial food products. Integration strategies and management guidelines are needed to optimize production of these new crops, which differ substantially from both annual grain crops and perennial forages. To offset relatively low grain yields, perennial grain cropping systems should be multifunctional. Growing perennial grains for several years to regenerate soil health before rotating to annual crops and growing perennial grains on sloped land and ecologically sensitive areas to reduce soil erosion and nutrient losses are two strategies that can provide ecosystem services and support multifunctionality. Several perennial cereals can be used to produce both grain and forage, and these dual-purpose crops can be intercropped with legumes for additional benefits. Highly diverse perennial grain polycultures can further enhance ecosystem services, but increased management complexity might limit their adoption.

AB  - This paper describes the development and evaluation of an innovative TDR distributed moisture sensor. This sensor features advantages of being responsive to the spatial variations of the soil moisture content. The geometry design of the sensor makes it rugged for field installation. Good linear calibration is obtained between the sensor measured dielectric constant and soil physical properties. Simulations by the finite element method (FEM) are conducted to assist the design of this sensor and to determine the effective sampling range. Compared with conventional types of moisture sensor, which only makes point measurement, this sensor possesses distributed moisture sensing capability. This new sensor is not only easy to install, but also measures moisture distribution with much lower cost. This new sensor holds promise to significantly improve the current field instruments. It will be a useful tool to help study the influence of a variety of moisture-related phenomena on infrastructure performance.

AB  - The dynamics of soil bulk density (BD) play an important role in soil water, heat, and gas transport, which is more complicated in Vertisols due to the shrinking and swelling process. Previous studies showed BD can be estimated from soil thermal conductivity (lambda) and water content (theta v) measurements. Thus we comprehensively evaluated the applicability of the commercial sensors (5TE/TP01) in determining soil BD dynamic affected by wetting and drying cycles in a Vertisol. The repacked and intact soil cores with various BD and theta v values were used to evaluate the accuracy of the two sensors for determining BD. We also assessed the potential of two thermal greases (MX-4 and TFX) in improving probe-soil contact and in determining BD dynamic of the Vertisol during wetting and drying (WD) cycle by different BD estimation models (Tian-de Vries model and Lu model). Results showed that the 5TE/TP01 combination gave accurate BD estimates with RMSEs of 0.0179-0.120 Mg m(- 3). For the WD cycle experiment, soil shrinkage led to a large bias in BD estimation. Thermal grease enhancing contact between the probes and soil matrix improved the accuracy of BD estimates, in which the TFX grease performed better (RMSE: 0.031-0.082 Mg m(-3)) than the MX-4 grease (RMSE: 0.067-0.204 Mg m(-3)). In regard to BD estimation models, the Lu model gave more accurate BD estimates (RMSE: 0.031-0.082 Mg m(-3)) than the Tian-de Vries model (RMSE: 0.057-0.187 Mg m(-3)). The high bias of BD estimation during WD cycles mainly occurred at the dry end side of soil shrinkage and at the beginning of wetting, which may result from soil cracking and the hysteresis of soil swelling. Our results demonstrate that the commercially available sensors in measuring soil water content and thermal property (e.g., 5TE/TP01) with the aid of thermal grease is a promising method to estimate the BD dynamics in Vertisols.

AB  - In situ approaches for determining lower limit (threshold, refill) values for irriation g management using continuously monitored data from volumetric soil water content (SWC) sensors were evaluated. Four indices were derived from SWC data: (i) apparent daily crop water up take p (ADCVTU), the reduction in SWC during daylight periods; (ii) daily soil water loss (DSWL) the reduction in SWC during 24 h periods; (iii) previous overnight redistribution (POR) overnight T reshold, drainage; and (iv) ADCWU normalised for reference evapotranspiration (ADCWU:ET) Indices.. were calculated for 0-20 and 20-40 cm soil depths in four drying cycles applied to melon and to autumn and spring tomato crops. In each drying cycle, there were well-watered and decay curve with three phases: (1) of rapid decline when drainage occurred; (2) of a much slowe and (3) of e constantly very low values not influenced by climate. The actual commencement of crop water stress was indicated by the first statistically significant difference in midday 11'1,,f between unwatered and well-watered plants. A protocol was developed to identif co y mmencement of crop water stress using ADCWU or DSWL in un-watered plants. POR was used to identify cessation of internal drainage. Then, the first reduction in ADCWU or DSWL while climatic variables (solar radiation, VPD) indicated a constant or increasing atmospheric evaporative demand was considered an "indication" of crop water stress, the second such reduction as 11 confirmation". In the four cycles studied "indications" of c, rop water stress using both ADCV,rU and DSWL for 0-20 cm soil were I (twice), 2 and 6 d after commencement f o water stress. When there was not appreciable climatic variation during phase 2, ADCVvrU and DSVIL detected crop water stress within 1-2 d Of'I'l-T. Generally, climate -mediated fluctuations i n ADCWU and DSWL during phase 2 delayed identification of the commencement of t wa er stress. Norm alising AD CVTU forET, reduced effects ofclimatic fluctuation. Using a 25% relative reduction in ADCWU:ET as a threshold, this parameter was more sensitive than ADCV U or V DSWL using the proposed protocols for detecting commencement of water stress. "Breaking " points in the rate of reduction of SWC, and variations in stem diameter were also compared for detecting commencement of crop water stress. This study suggested that reductions in SWC in drying soil can be used to identify lower limits for irrigation management usin SWC g sensors, and that stable climatic conditions are required to optimise these approaches.

AB  - A low power wireless sensor network based on LoRaWAN protocol was designed with a focus on the IoT low-cost Precision Agriculture applications, such as greenhouse sensing and actuation. All subsystems used in this research are designed by using commercial components and free or open-source software libraries. The whole system was implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of a modular system built with cheap off-the-shelf components, including sensors. The experimental outputs were collected and stored in a database managed by a virtual machine running in a cloud service. The collected data can be visualized in real time by the user with a graphical interface. The reliability of the whole system was proven during a continued experiment with two natural soils, Loamy Sand and Silty Loam. Regarding soil parameters, the system performance has been compared with that of a reference sensor from Sentek. Measurements highlighted a good agreement for the temperature within the supposed accuracy of the adopted sensors and a non-constant sensitivity for the low-cost volumetric water contents (VWC) sensor. Finally, for the low-cost VWC sensor we implemented a novel procedure to optimize the parameters of the non-linear fitting equation correlating its analog voltage output with the reference VWC.

AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising non-invasive technique to estimate snow water equivalent (SWE) over large areas. In contrast to preliminary studies focusing on shallow snow conditions (SWE <130 mm), more recently the method was shown experimentally to be sensitive also to deeper snowpacks providing the basis for its use at mountain experimental sites. However, hysteretic neutron response has been observed for complex snow cover including patchy snow-free areas. In the present study we aimed to understand and support the experimental findings using a comprehensive neutron modeling approach. Several simulations have been set up in order to disentangle the effect on the signal of different land surface characteristics and to reproduce multiple observations during periods of snow melt and accumulation. To represent the actual land surface heterogeneity and the complex snow cover, the model used data from terrestrial laser scanning. The results show that the model was able to accurately reproduce the CRNS signal and particularly the hysteresis effect during accumulation and melting periods. Moreover, the sensor footprint was found to be anisotropic and affected by the spatial distribution of liquid water and snow as well as by the topography of the nearby mountains. Under fully snow-covered conditions the CRNS is able to accurately estimate SWE without prior knowledge about snow density profiles or other spatial anomalies. These results provide new insights into the characteristics of the detected neutron signal in complex terrain and support the use of CRNS for long-term snow monitoring in high elevated mountain environments.

AB  - Each European country is using its own method for the determination of phosphorus availability to plants, together with an appropriate interpretation scheme of the P status and fertilizer recommendations. In order to compare systems, a soil exchange program was organized: 16 P methods were compared on 135 soils from 12 countries. The amount of extracted P decreased in the order P-total > P-oxal. > P-AL > P-Me3 > P-Bray > P-AAEDTA, P-DL, P-CAL > P-Olsen > P-paper (strip), P-AAAc, P-Morgan > P-H2O, P-CO2, P-CaCl2, Isotopically exchangeable P was also measured. A large variability was observed in the results obtained by laboratories using the same method, thus demonstrating the great importance of an identical lab procedure as a prerequisite to any comparison. The traditional correlation/regression approach revealed its limitations when applied to non-homogeneously distributed data and was replaced by more robust techniques that showed laboratory differential bias and confidence intervals of the log-transformed values. Even though all the methods reacted in the same way to increasing amounts of added P in several trials, there were wide differences between results obtained with different methods. The interpretation schemes for P status were also compared and revealed that about 50% of the tested soils were P-deficient. This observation appears not to be in line with a generally high P fertilization during the last decades in Europe and should lead to a better evaluation of the plant-available soil phosphorus.

AB  - A decline in rainfall as a source of agricultural water has affected and will continue to affect sustainable crop production globally including in Hungary. Conservation of the greatest water reservoir is important for the sustainable development of agriculture in Hungary. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the different tillage methods on soil moisture content, grain yield, and root weight of wheat (Triticum aestivum) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus) under rainfed conditions. A field study was conducted at the J & oacute;zsefmajor Experimental and Training Farm (JM) of the Hungarian University of Agriculture and Life Sciences near Hatvan. The experiment consisted of six tillage treatments: disking (D, 16 cm), shallow cultivation (SC, 20 cm), no-till (NT), deep cultivation (DC, 25 cm), loosening (L, 45 cm), and plowing (P, 30 cm). Soil moisture content (SMC) was measured monthly, and grain yield and root weight were measured at the end of the cropping period. Our results showed no significant difference in SMC between conservation and conventional tillage methods in 2018. However, in 2021, greater SMC was significantly conserved under NT compared to P. Regarding the sampling date, a significant increase in moisture with time was observed. A significantly lower SMC was observed on 3 June 2019 between L and D. while on the 9 September 2020, SMC significantly differed between P and all the other treatments (D, SC, NT, DC, and L). Interestingly in 2018, SMC was significantly lower at 10-20 cm depth between L and D. Notably the effect of depth on SMC was observed as moisture significantly increased with increasing depth in all tillage treatments. Root weight was greatest at DC (1.54 t ha-1) in 2018 and under L (3.89 t ha-1) in 2021. Similarly, wheat grain yield was greatest at DC (2.48 t ha-1) in 2018, while sunflower yield in 2021 was greatest at L (3.86 t ha-1). It is comprehensible that conservation tillage methods such as L and NT can increase SMC and grain yield.

AB  - Remote sensing of soil moisture has reached a level of maturity and accuracy for which the retrieved products can be used to improve hydrological and meteorological applications. In this study, the soil moisture product from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite is used for improving satellite rainfall estimates obtained from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission multisatellite precipitation analysis product (TMPA) using three different bottom up techniques: SM2RAIN, Soil Moisture Analysis Rainfall Tool, and Antecedent Precipitation Index Modification. The implementation of these techniques aims at improving the well-known top down rainfall estimate derived from TMPA products (version 7) available in near real time. Ground observations provided by the Australian Water Availability Project are considered as a separate validation data set. The three algorithms are calibrated against the gauge-corrected TMPA reanalysis product, 3B42, and used for adjusting the TMPA real-time product, 3B42RT, using SMOS soil moisture data. The study area covers the entire Australian continent, and the analysis period ranges from January 2010 to November 2013. Results show that all the SMOS-based rainfall products improve the performance of 3B42RT, even at daily time scale (differently from previous investigations). The major improvements are obtained in terms of estimation of accumulated rainfall with a reduction of the root-mean-square error of more than 25%. Also, in terms of temporal dynamic (correlation) and rainfall detection (categorical scores) the SMOS-based products provide slightly better results with respect to 3B42RT, even though the relative performance between the methods is not always the same. The strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm and the spatial variability of their performances are identified in order to indicate the ways forward for this promising research activity. Results show that the integration of bottom up and top down approaches has the potential to improve the quality of near-real-time rainfall estimates from remote sensing in the near future.

AB  - Cuttings are a common soil and water bioengineering technique used for slope stabilization and erosion control along rivers. Above- and belowground growth of cuttings, especially immediately after installation, have a strong impact on the protective performance. To assess the effects of diameter on the early growth performance of purple willow (Salix purpurea L.), freshly harvested (nondormant) cuttings of different diameters (5 to 24 mm) were planted as part of an outdoor raised-bed experiment from March to October of 2010. The aim of this study was to investigate the growth performance of purple willow cuttings and to gain deeper insight into the plant's development during the first growth stage (six months). After two months of growth, 99% of the cuttings sprouted, and the diameter had no statistically significant impact on the sprouting performance of the cuttings. During the first four months, aboveground biomass production (M-ag) was 5.7 and 4.4 (after two and four months, respectively) times higher than belowground biomass (M-bg). However, after six months, M-ag and M-bg were balanced. The diameter of the cuttings had a significant impact on biomass development at all of the time steps. The cuttings of the diameter class C (15 to 19 mm) produced the most M-ag and M-bg, with 33% and 34% of total M-ag and M-bg of all diameter classes after six months. Four months after planting, at least 80%, and after six months at least 90%, of the M-bg was allocated in the lowermost third of the cuttings. The observations showed high M-ag production for the entire period; M-bg production was relatively low during the first four months, which resulted in a diminished protective function of the roots until this specific point of development.

AB  - Dielectric soil moisture sensors have the potential for nondestructive and real- time monitoring of the stem water content (theta(st)) of living trees. This study was conducted to investigate the water use characteristics of trees in drylands through monitoring of qst using newly developed capacitance sensors (GS3). The plants used for data collection were Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (mesquite, invasive) in Sudan and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (tamarisk, invasive) and Prosopis pubescens Benth.(screwbean mesquite, native) in the United States. The GS3 probes were installed into the trunks of two trees for each species. Stem-specific calibration equations and temperature calibration equations were derived through laboratory experiments and analysis of field observation data. The temperature calibration equations reduced inappropriate variations of qst caused by daily fluctuations in stem temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data of qst in arid environments. The qst of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The qst of neither species in the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that they depend on shallow saline groundwater. The qst of the tamarisk decreased monotonically throughout the monitoring period, apparently in response to feeding damage caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diohabda sp.), which had been released for biological control of tamarisk.

AB  - Since 2008, a 5-year crop rotation experiment (winter wheat, pea, potato, barley undersown with red clover, and red clover) has been run in Tartu, Estonia, to evaluate the changes in soil chemical parameters under four fertilizer managements: (1) unfertilized conventional plots (conventional I), (2) conventional plots with addition of mineral fertilizers (conventional II), (3) organic plots with cover crops during the winter period (organic I), and (4) organic plots with the same cover crops plus a yearly amendment of 40tha(-1) of cattle manure (organic II). After the first rotation, results showed significant differences (P<0.05) in soil acidity dependent on the system with mean values ranging between 5.67 (conventional II) and 6.10 (organic II). In the organic II system, manure had a significant effect on the system, increasing the organic carbon (C) content by 0.34%, but in both organic systems, both cover crops and cattle manure were insufficient for maintaining a constant level of plant-available phosphorus (P) or potassium (K) in the soil. In the conventional II system, mineral fertilizers provided a sufficient amount of nitrogen (N) to the system and increased the concentration of P to 8.7mg per kg. The yearly mineral or organic amendments did not counteract the significant decrease in soil-available K after the first rotation. Lastly, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) availability, strongly influenced by the soil pH local conditions, decreased with time for all systems even though organic ones presented greater concentrations of both compounds. In conclusion, the four fertilization systems managed independently would not guarantee a constant soil nutrient concentration after the first rotation.

AB  - Accurately estimating of soil moisture content (SMC) is essential for effective irrigation water management and optimizing plant water productivity. Recent advancements in multi-sensor platforms and ensemble learning (EL) algorithms such as the use of UAV-based multispectral (MS) and thermal infrared (TIR) images, have enabled precise mapping of SMC at the field level. The purpose of this study is to optimize the multi-dimensional (n-D) index set and EL model to achieve accurate inversion mapping of SMC in the 0-60 cm root zone at a kiwifruit orchard during the fruit growth period (May-Sep 2022). The n-D index set was computed using kiwifruit canopy MS and TIR data from UAV along with in-field temperature data (air temperature [Ta], kiwifruit canopy temperature [Tc], soil temperature [Ts], and Ta-Tc, Ta-Ts, Tc-Ts). The primary findings of this study are as follows: (1) The Three-Dimensional Drought Index (TDDI), Temperature Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), and Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) demonstrated superior performance in capturing temporal variations of root zone SMC compared to Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Enhance Vegetation Index (EVI). (2) The optimal Categorical Boosting (Catboost) model with two optimal TDDIs (TDDI22: (Tc-Ts)-EVI10,6,2-CWSI space and TDDI7: Tc-NDVI7,3-CWSI space), exhibited exceptional performance for SMC estimation, with determination coefficient (R-2) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.966 +/- 0.010 and 0.046 +/- 0.003%, respectively. (3) The planted-by-planted mapping performed well in estimating root zone SMC at different growth stages and under different irrigation treatments, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.936 +/- 0.074 (p < 0.001). This study demonstrated that the integration of multi-sensor indicators and EL models can improve the accuracy of SMC estimation due to its robust adaptability to various field conditions. Furthermore, the planted-grid-based SMC mapping framework can be considered as a valuable approach for monitoring dynamic SMC, facilitating informed irrigation decisions at the individual planting grid.

AB  - Soilmoisture is a key part of Earth's climate systems, including agricultural and hydrological cycles. Soil moisture data from satellite and numerical models is typically provided at a global scale with coarse spatial resolution, which is not enough for local and regional applications. In this study, a soil moisture downscaling model was developed using satellite-derived variables targeting Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture as a reference dataset in East Asia based on the optimization of a modified regression tree. A total of six variables, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced SCATterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture products, Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) Digital Elevation Model (DEM), and MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, including Land Surface Temperature, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, and land cover, were used as input variables. The optimization was conducted through a pruning approach for operational use, and finally 59 rules were extracted based on root mean square errors (RMSEs) and correlation coefficients (r). The developed downscaling model showed a good modeling performance (r = 0.79, RMSE = 0.056 m(3)center dot m(3), and slope = 0.74). The 1 km downscaled soil moisture showed similar time series patterns with both GLDAS and ground soil moisture and good correlation with ground soil moisture (average r = 0.47, average RMSD = 0.038 m(3)center dot m(3)) at 14 ground stations. The spatial distribution of 1 km downscaled soil moisture reflected seasonal and regional characteristics well, although the model did not result in good performance over a few areas such as Southern China due to very high cloud cover rates. The results of this study are expected to be helpful in operational use to monitor soil moisture throughout East Asia since the downscaling model produces daily high resolution (1 km) real time soil moisture with a low computational demand. This study yielded a promising result to operationally produce daily high resolution soil moisture data from multiple satellite sources, although there are yet several limitations. In future research, more variables including Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation, Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture, and other vegetation indices will be integrated to improve the performance of the proposed soil moisture downscaling model.

AB  - Reliable and accurate monitoring of soil water content (theta) across the landscape is indispensable for many water resources applications. Capacitance-based in situ soil water content measuring devices are extensively used despite their sensitivity to soil properties besides water content, e.g., temperature and organic matter content. The main goals of this study were to: (i) examine the effects of temperature, hysteresis of the temperature response, and probe-to-probe variability on the performance of three (5TE, EC-5, and EC-TM) single capacitance sensors (SCS) in a Hawaiian Oxisol; and (ii) develop empirical calibration equations to correct for temperature and improve measurement accuracy. The SCS raw output and thermocouple temperature measurements were recorded at 1-min intervals during heating and cooling cycles between 1 and 45 degrees C. The three SCS and thermocouples were inserted in uniformly packed soils with theta varying from 0 to 0.55 m(3) m(-3). We used three probes for each SCS, and the entire experiment was replicated with two heating and cooling cycles. Temperature, hysteresis, and the probe-to-probe variability effects were highly significant (p < 0.05) for all three SCS. Estimated theta using soil-specific calibrations at 25 degrees C significantly increased with increasing temperature for all SCS. The 5TE sensor showed increasing temperature sensitivity with increasing water content. However, the EC-5 and EC-TM sensors exhibited a bidirectional response to temperature, with the highest sensitivity at similar to 0.10 m(3) m(-3) water content. An empirically derived temperature-dependent calibration equation substantially reduced the variability (>90% reduction in interquartile range) in measured water content due to changing soil temperature. Applying differing temperature corrections for heating and cooling did not improve the calibration any further.

AB  - Moisture content (Psi) of poultry manure or litter is an important property of the material. Relating manure or litter Psi to its ammonia (NH3) emission is conducive to assessing and/or controlling real-time ammonia emissions from the manure or litter. However; means to measure manure or litter on a real-time basis is lacking. This study was carried out to characterize the operational performance of a commercially available soil moisture sensor for measuring V of meat-bird (broiler and turkey) litters and laying-hen manure. The Psi tested ranged from 27.1% to 65.7% for broiler litter, 22.8% to 56.1% for turkey litter, and 11.0% to 75.0% for layer manure. Bulk density (rho) ranged from 318 to 468 kg m(-3) (20 to 29 lb ft(-3)) for the broiler and turkey litters and from 151 to 943 kg m(-3)(9 to 55 lb ft(-3)) for laying-hen manure. Linear regression equations were developed to relate the sensor output to Psi and rho for the meat-bird litters and to Psi for the laying-hen manure, all yielding good fit (R-2=0.95 -0.99). An uncertainty analysis performed on the developed calibration equations revealed average errors in the V estimation of +/- 7.1% estimated value for the poultry litters and +/- 6.7% estimated value for the laying-hen manure. Litter temperature was found to have a small impact on Psi measurement by the sensor, 0.31% of measured mV per degrees C (0.17% per degrees F) deviation from the mean operating temperature over the range of 4 degrees C to 24 degrees C (39 degrees F to 75 degrees F). Results of the study indicate that when properly calibrated, the soil moisture sensor offers a reasonable means for real-time measurement of poultry litter or manure moisture content.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key parameter of the hydrological process, which affects exchanges of water and heat at the land/atmosphere interface. The "trapezoid" (or "triangle") method has been widely applied to SM monitoring based on the pixel distribution within the thermal and optical remote sensing observations. However, the trapezoid method is a linear empirical model highly related to the retrieval accuracy of the surface temperature. In the article, the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were applied to retrieve SM through an improved method over the Tibetan Plateau. The improved method is integrated with the "trapezoid" model and multiple learning techniques, Random Forest (RF) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Meanwhile, RF and XGBoost were both trained with SM target data (the scale of SM and soil temperature) derived from the Tibetan Plateau observations, and the input variables were derived from MODIS observations. Compared with the SM measured, the results showed the root mean square error, the mean absolute error, and the correlation coefficient of the ensemble retrievals were 0.046-0.081 m(3)m(-3), 0.030-0.065 m(3)m(-3), and 0.60-0.87, respectively, which is better than that of the separate model. The ideas to implement the combination of traditional inversion algorithms and machine learning methods are helpful for researches in remote sensing fields.

AB  - Vegetable production systems are typically tillage- and input-intensive, though they may vary widely in production practices utilized. Improved understanding of soil water and nitrogen (N) processes with the use of agroecosystem models may aid in the optimization of crop yields and reduction of N losses. The objectives of this study were to (1) apply the RZ-SHAW model to diversified vegetable systems of varying production intensity, and (2) to elucidate soil N processes key loss pathways to inform opportunities for improving N cycling and sustainable intensification in these systems. The systems included conventional (CONV), low input organic (LI), and organic high tunnel (HT) vegetable systems. Soil water content and temperature were simulated well (rRMSE < 0.30) in all systems. Simulated soil NO3 over bar -N content was closer to measured values in the CONV than other systems. On average, the soil NO3 over bar -N content was underpredicted by 8 kg N ha(-1) in the 0-0.15 m, and 5 kg N ha(-1) in the 0.30-0.50 m soil layer in the LI system. In all systems, simulated daily N2O flux followed the trends in the measured values, but model predicted greater peaks than measured. Nitrate leaching was the greatest N loss pathway in all systems, though timing and driving factors varied by system. Asynchrony between N mineralization and crop uptake was observed throughout the LI rotation, indicating opportunities for targeted N and irrigation inputs to increase crop yields. Simulation results indicate the need for additional study of soil microbial and N processes in HT systems.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important indicator that is widely used in meteorology, hydrology, and agriculture. Two key problems must be addressed in the process of downscaling soil moisture: the selection of the downscaling method and the determination of the environmental variables, namely, the influencing factors of soil moisture. This study attempted to utilize machine learning and data mining algorithms to downscale the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km and compared the advantages and disadvantages of the random forest model and the Cubist algorithm to determine the more suitable soil moisture downscaling method for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB). At present, either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or a digital elevation model (DEM) is selected as the environmental variable for the downscaling models. In contrast, variables, such as albedo and evapotranspiration, are infrequently applied; nevertheless, this study selected these two environmental variables, which have a considerable impact on soil moisture. Thus, the selected environmental variables in the downscaling process included the longitude, latitude, elevation, slope, NDVI, daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST_D and LST_N, respectively), albedo, evapotranspiration (ET), land cover (LC) type, and aspect. This study achieved downscaling on a 16-day timescale based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A comparison of the random forest model with the Cubist algorithm revealed that the R-2 of the random forest-based downscaling method is higher than that of the Cubist algorithm-based method by 0.0161; moreover, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced by 0.0006 and the mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced by 0.0014. Testing the accuracies of these two downscaling methods showed that the random forest model is more suitable than the Cubist algorithm for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km in the MLRYRB, which provides a theoretical basis for obtaining high spatial resolution soil moisture data.

AB  - Velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti Medik.) is a troublesome broadleaf weed that competes with crops for resources such as soil moisture. Water stress can affect the ability of weed species to grow and produce seeds. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of degree of water stress on the growth and fecundity of A. threophrasti using soil moisture sensors under greenhouse conditions. Abutilon threophrasti seeds collected from a corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] field were grown in silty clay loam soil, and plants were maintained at 100%, 75%, 50%, and 25% soil field capacity (FC) corresponding to no, light, moderate, and high water-stress conditions, respectively. Water was added daily to pots based on soil moisture levels detected by a Meter Group 5TM sensor to maintain the desired water-stress level required by treatment. Plants maintained at 100% FC had the maximum number of leaves (28 leaves plant(-1)), followed by 21 and 15 leaves plant(-1) at 75% and 50% FC, respectively. Abutilon threophrasti at 100% and 75% FC achieved maximum plant height (108 to 123 cm) compared with 83 cm at 50% FC. Abutilon threophrasti maintained at 75% FC had the greatest growth index (79,907 cm(3)) followed by 72,197 cm(3) at 100% FC and 64,256 cm(3) at 50% FC. Seed production was similar at 100%, 75%, and 50% FC (288 to 453 seeds plant(-1)) compared with 2 seeds plant(-1) at 25% FC. This is because the majority of plants maintained at 25% FC did not survive more than 77 d after transplanting. Seed germination was 96% to 100% at 100%, 75%, and 50% FC compared with 20% germination at 25% FC. Abutilon threophrasti can survive >= 50% FC continuous water-stress conditions, although with reduced leaf number, plant height, and growth index compared with 75% and 100% FC.

TI  - Spatio-temporal soil moisture retrieval at the catchment scale using a dense network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA  - English
KW  - WATER CONTENT
AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a powerful technique for retrieving representative estimates of soil water content at a horizontal scale of hectometres (the "field scale") and depths of tens of centimetres ("the root zone"). This study demonstrates the potential of the CRNS technique to obtain spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture beyond the integrated volume from isolated CRNS footprints. We use data from an observational campaign carried out between May and July 2019 that featured a dense network of more than 20 neutron detectors with partly overlapping footprints in an area that exhibits pronounced soil moisture gradients within one square kilometre. The present study is the first to combine these observations in order to represent the heterogeneity of soil water content at the sub-footprint scale as well as between the CRNS stations. First, we apply a state-of-the-art procedure to correct the observed neutron count rates for static effects (heterogeneity in space, e.g. soil organic matter) and dynamic effects (heterogeneity in time, e.g. barometric pressure). Based on the homogenized neutron data, we investigate the robustness of a calibration approach that uses a single calibration parameter across all CRNS stations. Finally, we benchmark two different interpolation techniques for obtaining spatio-temporal representations of soil moisture: first, ordinary Kriging with a fixed range; second, spatial interpolation complemented by geophysical inversion ("constrained interpolation"). To that end, we optimize the parameters of a geostatistical interpolation model so that the error in the forward-simulated neutron count rates is minimized, and suggest a heuristic forward operator to make the optimization problem computationally feasible. Comparison with independent measurements from a cluster of soil moisture sensors (SoilNet) shows that the constrained interpolation approach is superior for representing horizontal soil moisture gradients at the hectometre scale. The study demonstrates how a CRNS network can be used to generate coherent, consistent, and continuous soil moisture patterns that could be used to validate hydrological models or remote sensing products.

AB  - Many spatial interpolation methods perform well for gentle terrains when producing spatially continuous surfaces based on ground point data. However, few interpolation methods perform satisfactorily for complex terrains. Our objective in the present study was to analyze the suitability of several popular interpolation methods for complex terrains and propose an optimal method. A data set of 153 soil water profiles (1 m) from the semiarid hilly gully Loess Plateau of China was used, generated under a wide range of land use types, vegetation types and topographic positions. Four spatial interpolation methods, including ordinary kriging, inverse distance weighting, linear regression and regression kriging were used for modeling, randomly partitioning the data set into 2/3 for model fit and 1/3 for independent testing. The performance of each method was assessed quantitatively in terms of mean-absolute-percentage-error, root-mean-square-error, and goodness-of-prediction statistic. The results showed that the prediction accuracy differed significantly between each method in complex terrain. The ordinary kriging and inverse distance weighted methods performed poorly due to the poor spatial autocorrelation of soil moisture at small catchment scale with complex terrain, where the environmental impact factors were discontinuous in space. The linear regression model was much more suitable to the complex terrain than the former two distance-based methods, but the predicted soil moisture changed too sharply near the boundary of the land use types and junction of the sunny (southern) and shady (northern) slopes, which was inconsistent with reality because soil moisture should change gradually in short distance due to its mobility in soil. The most optimal interpolation method in this study for the complex terrain was the hybrid regression kriging, which produced a detailed, reasonable prediction map with better accuracy and prediction effectiveness.

AB  - Gravel mulching is an ancient mulching system with a history of more than 300 years in China. To explore the changes of soil-water content (SWC) and heat transport in watermelon gravel-mulched fields under the drip irrigation, we simulated three irrigation quotas (W1, 180 m(3)/hm(2); W2, 270 m(3)/hm(2); and W3, 360 m(3)/hm(2)) and three irrigation frequencies (F1, three times; F2, six times; and F3, nine times) based on HYDRUS-2D. The results indicated that peak SWC increased with irrigation quota. The range of fluctuation of SWC decreased as irrigation frequency increased. The temperature of the 0-40 cm soil layer varied with air temperature, but the range of fluctuation decreased with depth. Irrigation affected the distribution of soil water, increased soil heat capacity, and reduced the impact of air temperature on soil temperature, thus delaying the impact of air temperature on soil temperature. High-frequency drip irrigation could therefore effectively improve SWC, reduce water stress during the period of watermelon growth, and effectively delay the effect of air temperature on soil temperature, providing a theoretical basis for developing reasonable irrigation strategies and regulating soil water and heat in gravel-mulched fields.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in the water, energy cycle between atmosphere and land surface but existing passive microwave soil moisture products typically have spatial resolutions of tens of kilometers, which fails to meet the requirements of regional applications. Even though numerous machine/deep learning methods have been applied to downscale SM, few studies have investigated the performance differences of diverse approaches and attempted to integrate various methods to improve downscaling accuracy. Therefore, this study firstly evaluated and inter-compared the downscaling performances of six machine/deep learning approaches and further proposed a hybrid downscaling method based on Bayesian three-cornered hat merging (MATCH). The daily 1 km seamless soil moisture product during 2015-2019 over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau was then obtained. Evaluation and inter-comparison results revealed that there was obvious performance discrepancy among different downscaling approaches and the gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and random forest (RF) were the best two methods, which performed best in the southern and eastern of the plateau, respectively. While the artificial neural network (ANN) outperformed other approaches in the northwestern areas. Validation against in-situ measurements showed that compared with SMAP SM, the MATCH SM exhibited comparable accuracy and lower error with mean R and ubRMSE values of 0.55 and 0.047 m3/m3. The mean R and ubRMSE values for SMAP SM were 0.67 and 0.056 m3/m3, respectively. In addition, the MATCH SM presented great improvement compared with any single downscaled SM data, having the highest correlation and the lowest ubRMSE scores. While, among different methods, the highest R was 0.50 (GBDT) and the lowest ubRMSE was 0.052 m3/m3 (residual network (ResNet)). Besides, the downscaled SM could accurately reflect the temporal variations of soil moisture and precipitation, and effectively represent the spatial patterns of soil moisture. Satisfactory downscaling results were achieved in arid and semi-arid areas whereas a certain degree of overestimation still existed in the eastern and southeastern regions with dense vegetation and high moisture conditions. Such overestimation was inherent from original SMAP SM but was mitigated after downscaling. In conclusion, performance differences existed among diverse downscaling approaches and the developed MATCH method could maximize the potentials of each method and show encouraging downscaling performances.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to determine and evaluate the calibration curve for low-cost electronic sensors in soils from a reclaimed and degraded area in the Brazilian semiarid region. Design/methodology/approach The probes were made, programmed and inserted in soil previously conditioned in polyethylene cylinders. The sets "cylinder + probe + soil" were subjected to saturation for a period of 24 h and, subsequently, gravitational drainage at room temperature and daily weighings were performed. When the set reached constant weight, the samples were taken to dry in an oven at 105 degrees C to determine the dry mass and later, determine the gravimetric moisture and convert it into volumetric. The volumetric moistures obtained were related to measured frequency variations and the adjustments were analyzed by regression, which was subjected to analysis of variance (p = 0.05), and related by a third-degree polynomial equation whose quality of the fit was verified with coefficient of determination (R-2). Findings The obtained moistures were related to the estimated moistures and evaluated by the root-mean-square error and straight 1:1. The results demonstrate that the sensors are not accurate for moistures in saturation, but representative and statistically acceptable results for moistures up to field capacity. Originality/value This paper has not been published before in its current, or similar form.

To reduce the basis risk of index insurance, the integration of satellite data is of growing interest in research. The objective of this study is to obtain preliminary evidence regarding farmers' perceived usefulness (PU) of satellite-based index insurance.Design/methodology/approachBy modifying the transtheoretical model of change to a transtheoretical model of PU, German farmers' gradual PU of satellite-based index insurance was investigated.FindingsThe results show that the average farmer perceives satellite-based index insurance as useful. It can be particularly seen that a higher level of education in an agricultural context as well as higher trust in index insurance products increases farmers' gradual PU. Moreover, higher relative weather-related income losses increase farmers' gradual PU.Research limitations/implicationsIt is recommended to apply latent variables when conducting future investigations regarding farmers' PU.Originality/valueTo the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to explore farmers' PU of upcoming satellite-based index insurance by modifying and applying the transtheoretical model in a new way.

AB  - Soil moisture sensors are increasingly deployed in sensor networks for both agronomic research and precision agriculture. Soil-specific calibration improves the accuracy of soil water content sensors, but laboratory calibration of individual sensors is not practical for networks installed across heterogeneous settings. Using daily water content readings collected from a sensor network (42 locations x 5 depths = 210 sensors) installed at the Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) near Pullman, Washington, we developed an automated calibration approach that can be applied to individual sensors after installation. As a first step, we converted sensor-based estimates of apparent dielectric permittivity to volumetric water content using three different calibration equations (Topp equation, CAF laboratory calibration, and the complex refractive index model, or CRIM). In a second, "re-calibration" step, we used two pedotransfer functions based upon particle size fractions and/or bulk density to estimate water content at wilting point, field capacity, and saturation at each sensor insertion point. Using an automated routine, we extracted the same three reference points, when present, from each sensor's record, and then bias corrected and re-scaled the sensor data to match the estimated reference points. Based on validation with field-collected cores, the Topp equation provided the most accurate calibration with an RMSE of 0.074 m(3) m(-3), but automated re-calibration with a local pedotransfer function outperformed any of the calibrations alone, yielding a network-wide RMSE of 0.055 m(3) m(-3). The initial calibration equation used in the first step was irrelevant when the re-calibration was applied. After correcting for the reference core measurement error of 0.026 m(3) m(-3) used for calibration and validation, the error of the sensors alone (RMSEadj) was computed as 0.049 m(3) m(-3). Sixty-five percent of individual sensors exhibited re calibration errors less than or equal to the network RMSEadj. The incorporation of soil physical information at sensor installation sites, applied retroactively via an automated routine to in situ soil water content sensors, substantially improved network sensor accuracy.

AB  - Soil moisture and salinity are two crucial coastal saline soil variables, which influence the soil quality and agricultural productivity in the reclaimed coastal region. Accurately characterizing the spatial variability of these soil parameters is critical for the rational development and utilization of tideland resources. In the present study, the spatial variability of soil moisture and salinity in the reclaimed area of Hangzhou gulf, Shangyu City, Zhejiang Province, China, was detected using the data acquired from radar image and the proximal sensor EM38. Soil moisture closely correlates radar scattering coefficient, and a simplified inversion model was built based on a backscattering coefficient extracted from multi-polarization data of ALOS/PALSAR and in situ soil moisture measured by a time domain reflectometer to detect soil moisture variations. The result indicated a higher accuracy of soil moisture inversion by the HH polarization mode than those by the HV mode. Soil salinity is reflected by soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). Further, ECa can be rapidly detected by EM38 equipment in situ linked with GPS for characterizing the spatial variability of soil salinity. Based on the strong spatial variability and interactions of soil moisture and salinity, a cokriging interpolation method with auxiliary variable of backscattering coefficient was adopted to map the spatial variability of ECa. When compared with a map of ECa interpolated by the ordinary kriging method, detail was revealed and the accuracy was increased by 15.3%. The results conclude that the integrating active remote sensing and proximal sensors EM38 are effective and acceptable approaches for rapidly and accurately detecting soil moisture and salinity variability in coastal areas, especially in the subtropical coastal zones of China with frequent heavy cloud cover.

AB  - In a field study, soils of four conventional free-range and organic broiler runs were analyzed for N and P concentrations in the years 2000 and 2001. Zones of different use intensity by broilers were identified on the free runs and mean zonal nutrient contents were compared with each other. Intensity of use by birds and spatial distribution of soil nutrient concentrations were found to be related to each other. Fecal N input by broilers resulted in accumulation of soil mineral nitrogen (N-min) contents down to a 90-cm sampling depth. In highly frequented "hot spots," plant requirement as defined by the German "N-Basis-Sollwert" (110 kg/ha N-min) for grassland was exceeded in all four cases. This implies an increased environmental risk of ammonia volatilization and nitrate leaching. Fecal P input by broilers resulted in accumulation of plant-available and thus mobile soil P (phosphorus extracted with calcium-acetate-lactate [P-CAL] and phosphorus extracted with water [P-w]) in the most intensely used zones. In these areas, soil P contents exceeded 90 mg/kg P-CAL (upper limit of soil test P defined in Germany for optimum plant yield) by as much as 217 mg/kg, which indicates an enhanced risk of P loss from the soil via runoff or leaching. The conclusion might be drawn that, with regard to nutrient loss from free-run soils, intensive indoor production in a closed system may be more environmentally neutral than conventional free-range or organic production. However, to put this into perspective, the scope of the environmental risk connected with spatially limited point accumulation of nutrients should be considered. Furthermore, an environmental evaluation must also account for the fate and environmental effects of the broiler litter produced inside the broiler house.

AB  - The rice-wheat annual double cropping system occupies some 0.5 million ha in the Himalayan foothills of Nepal. Alternating soil drying and wetting cycles characterize the 6-10 weeks long dry-to-wet season transition period (DWT) after wheat harvesting and before wetland rice transplanting. Mineral fertilizer use in the predominant smallholder agriculture is low and crops rely largely on native soil N for their nutrition. Changes in soil aeration status during DWT are likely to stimulate soil N losses. The effect of management options that avoid the nitrate buildup in soils during DWT by N immobilization in plant or microbial biomass was studied under controlled conditions in a greenhouse (2001/2002) and validated under field conditions in Nepal in 2002. In potted soil in the greenhouse, the gradual increase in soil moisture resulted in a nitrate N peak of 20 mg (kg soil)(-1) that rapidly declined as soil moisture levels exceeded 40% water-filled pore space (equiv. 75% field capacity). Similarly, the maximum soil nitrate build-up of 40 kg N ha(-1) under field conditions was followed by its near complete disappearance with soil moisture levels exceeding 46% water-filled pore space at the onset of the monsoon rains. Incorporation of wheat straw and/or N uptake by green manure crops reduced nitrate accumulation in the soil to < 5 mg N kg(-1) in pots and < 30 kg N ha(-1) in the field (temporary N immobilization), thus reducing the risk for N losses to occur. This "saved" N benefited the subsequent crop of lowland rice with increases in N accumulation from 130 mg pot(-1) (bare soil) to 185 mg pot(-1) (green manure plus wheat straw) and corresponding grain yield increases from 1.7 Mg ha(-1) to 3.6 Mg ha(-1) in the field. While benefits from improved soil N management on lowland rice are obvious, possible carry-over effects on wheat and the feasibility of proposed options at the farm level require further studies.

AB  - Increased concern about potential losses of phosphorus (P) from agricultural fields receiving animal waste has resulted in the implementation of new state and federal regulations related to nutrient management. In response to strengthened nutrient management standards that require consideration of P, North Carolina has developed a site-specific P indexing system called the Phosphorus Loss Assessment Tool (PLAT) to predict relative amounts of potential P loss from agricultural fields. The purpose of this study was to apply the PLAT index on farms throughout North Carolina in an attempt to predict the percentage and types of farms that will be forced to change management practices due to implementation of new regulations. Sites from all 100 counties were sampled, with the number of samples taken from each county depending on the proportion of the state's agricultural land that occurs in that county. Results showed that approximately 8% of producers in the state will be required to apply animal waste or inorganic fertilizer on a P rather than nitrogen basis, with the percentage increasing for farmers who apply animal waste (approximately 27%). The PLAT index predicted the greatest amounts of P loss from sites in the Coastal Plain region of North Carolina and from sites receiving poultry waste. Loss of dissolved P through surface runoff tended to be greater than other loss pathways and presents an area of concern as no best management practices (BMPs) currently exist for the reduction of in-field dissolved P. The PLAT index predicted the areas in the state that are known to be disproportionately vulnerable to P loss due to histories of high P applications, high densities of animal units, or soil type and landscapes that are most susceptible to P loss.

AB  - Surface soil moisture (M-SS) is a key factor governing environmental interactions in any catchment. Energy flux between soil and atmosphere, soil temperature, and heat diffusion in soil are examples of impressible interactions. Consequently, the agriculture sector and its many dependent industries are influenced by this element. Hence, investigating new optimized preprocessing and input selection methods for processing, interpretation, modeling, and prediction of M-SS is necessary to ensure sustainable agriculture. To this end, satellite products were studied for the province of Quebec, Canada. Two overall deep learning (DL) approaches are proposed in this study. The first and most efficient one is extracting meaningful modeling parameters by the time-series structural-analysis-based method, and the second one is using the combination of optimization algorithms and the DL method. The structure of the extracted time series from satellite data was assessed by several tests and an intense periodic pattern was detected. Therefore, additive Holt-Winter's (S-HW), seasonal standardization (S-std), and spectral analysis (S-A) were chosen as preprocessing methods for the structural analysis preprocessing. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model was utilized for short-term forecasting of un-preprocessed and preprocessed M-SS datasets. Along with structural-analysis-based methodology, genetic and teacher-learner-based algorithms (GA and T(L)A) were coupled with LSTM to assess the coupled models' performance for M-SS forecasting for the first time. Based on the structural analysis of data, limited hidden states (h(t)) were selected for modeling {1, 2, 7, 9, 52}: network training and forecasts were undertaken according to these hidden states. Since the long-term characteristics of the time series like trend and level are not significant in short-term modeling, the LSTM (S-std, 9), correlation coefficient (R) = 0.970, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 1.339 outperformed other models, followed closely by LSTM (S-HW, 1), R = 0.922, RMSE = 1.958. Conversely, for long-term forecast, as these attributes impact the structure, LSTM (S-HW, 2), R = 0.922, RMSE = 0.1961 was more successful in the prediction of patterns and fluctuations, followed by LSTM (S-std, 52), R = 0.920, RMSE = 2.064, which was more complicated than the model developed for short-term modeling. GA-LSTM (h(t) = 32, R = 0.930, RMSE = 1.852) and T(L)A-LSTM (h(t) = 37, R = 0.934, RMSE = 1.781) also enhanced the long-term forecasting results. Integration of these two optimization methods had two benefits. First, due to the stochastic nature of optimization algorithms and DL methods, the search space for the optimized parameter (h(t)) was greatly increased and many possibilities were investigated. Second, the LSTM could perform a long-term forecast of the M-SS without preprocessing, which was not possible by structural analysis. On the other hand, these methods were much computationally expensive and the combination of their controlling parameters with other controlling parameters of LSTM created numerous possibilities. However, as TLA is parameter free and much less sophisticated than GA, it is a more computational-effective method, and subsequently a better option than GA.

AB  - The infiltration and distribution of water through unsaturated soil determine its mechanical and hydrological properties. However, there are few methods that can accurately capture the spatial distribution of moisture inside soil. This study aims to demonstrate the use of actively heated fiber optic (AHFO) and Brillouin optical time domain analysis (BOTDA) technologies for monitoring soil moisture distribution as well as strain distribution. In addition to a laboratory model test, finite element analyses were conducted to interpret the measurements. During the experiment, the fine particle migration was also measured to understand its influence on soil hydraulic conductivity. The results of the experiment indicate that (i) for a soil that has never experienced a watering-dewatering cycle, water infiltration can be accurately calculated using the Richards' equation; (ii) migration of fine soil particles caused by the watering-dewatering cycle significantly increases the hydraulic conductivity; and (iii) two critical zones (drainage and erosion) play significant roles in determining the overall hydraulic conductivity of the entire soil. This study provides a new method for monitoring the changes in soil moisture, soil strain, and hydraulic conductivity. The observations suggest that the effect of fine particles migration should be considered while evaluating soil moisture distribution and water movement.

AB  - Thresholds of soil matric potential (SMP) and available soil water content (AWC) required to prevent water limitations between irrigations were determined for bell pepper, melon, and spring and winter tomato grown in Mediterranean-type greenhouses on the south-eastern coast of Spain. Thresholds were identified by measuring the divergence of leaf water potential of un-watered plants from that of well-watered plants. Soil matric potential thresholds were -58 kPa for pepper, -35 kPa for melon, and -38 to -58 kPa for tomato. In general, SMP thresholds were more negative under lower evaporative demand conditions such as during autumn and winter months. Available soil water content thresholds, for a given crop and drying cycle, differed appreciably depending on soil depth and the method used to calculate the values. For the four crops studied, AWC thresholds calculated at 0-40 cm were 13-15% higher than those calculated at 0-20 cm. Each AWC threshold for 0-20 cm depth was 21-29% lower when AWC was based on laboratory rather than field determinations of field capacity and permanent wilting point. For a given method of calculating AWC, AWC threshold values were similar for different crops and drying cycles, suggesting limited sensitivity of the AWC approach. Using the manufacturer's calibration, the capacitance sensor used for SWC measurements overestimated SWC by an average of 36%. An in situ calibration provided generally good agreement with the actual SWC between 0.15 and 0.22 cm(3) cm(-3); however, for higher SWC values, the in situ calibration underestimated SWC. The results of this study demonstrated the uncertainty of using recommended fixed AWC threshold values for irrigation management, using SWC sensors, because of issues related to the definition of rooting depth, measurement of FC and PWP, sensor calibration, and sensor accuracy across the relevant range of water contents. These data suggest that SMP thresholds are much more reliable than AWC thresholds for scheduling irrigations in greenhouse-grown vegetable crops. Technical issues regarding on-farm measurement of SMP and SWC are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI  - Temperature-stable heat pulse driver circuit for low-voltage single supply soil moisture sensors based on junction transistors
T2  - ELECTRONICS LETTERS
LA  - English
AB  - A temperature-stable heat pulse driver for low-voltage single supply soil moisture sensors based on junction transistors is presented. The temperature drift of the heat pulse, caused by the variations dVBE/dT in the transistors placed in the feedback loop, is fully compensated for. A circuit measures the variations dVBE/dT of the transistors in the feedback loop and generates a current which is proportional to the -(1/R0) dV(BE)/dT that, when passed through another resistor inside the feedback loop (R-1 = R-0), provides full temperature compensation. The topology of the circuit also provides an output voltage (the voltage used to define the heat pulse) which does not need to be calibrated, since it depends only on a reference voltage external to the feedback loop.

AB  - To achieve higher production with minimal environmental impact in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), it is crucial to make technical transitions from low-input to nutrient-use-efficient production systems. P-dipping, a localized phosphorus (P) application on seedling roots, is a potential approach to enable such a transition for lowland rice production. However, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of this approach in smallholders' heterogeneous field conditions is lacking. Therefore, 18 on-farm trials were implemented by applying three P application treatments (zero P; P broadcasting at 13.1 kg P ha 1; P-dipping at 13.1 kg P ha 1) with and without N top dressing (60 kg N ha 1) under a range of topographic, edaphic, and climatic conditions in the highlands of Madagascar. The P-dipping had consistently greater yields vs. zero P, with an average increase of 1.1 & PLUSMN; 0.7 t ha- 1 and 1.8 & PLUSMN; 0.7 t ha- 1 under non-N-applied and N-applied conditions, respectively. These yield gains by P-dipping corresponded to substantially high agronomic P-use efficiency (AEP: kg yield gain per kg P applied) of 82 & PLUSMN; 52 kg kg-1 in the non-N-applied plots and 136 & PLUSMN; 51 kg kg- 1 in the N-applied plots that were both twice as large as those obtained from P broadcasting. The effect was particularly prominent in fields at high elevation and late transplanted fields at the low elevation site where P-dipping alleviated not only P deficiency but also late season low-temperature stress by shortening days to heading. The P-dipping effect was also increased when the fields had erratic water levels after transplanting, which was associated with vigorous initial growth and avoidance of submergence stress. No significant correlations were detected between AEP values and any of the soil properties except for P availability. This study revealed that the effect of P-dipping is consistent in various P deficient soils and is enhanced by combining with N topdressing and when fields are prone to late-season cold stress or early season submergence stress. The finding of this study provides a practical insight for smallholder rice farmers how and where P fertilizer is effectively applied toward sustainable intensification and resilience to weather-induced stress in SSA.

AB  - Despite subtle variations in soil moisture (SM) across a paddock, irrigation scheduling in New Zealand dairy farms is solely based on the SM monitored at a single location, primarily using an Aquaflex soil moisture sensor at a specified root depth. This study aimed to address this issue by assessing the "effective" root depth of a pasture, calibrating the Aquaflex soil moisture sensor and evaluating the spatial and temporal variability of SM. Twenty non-weighing lysimeters and 1 Aquaflex with 2 sensors installed 125-m away from the lysimeters on the same paddock were utilized for the study. TDR probes with 200-, 500- and 900-mm lengths were installed vertically adjacent to the Aquaflex and the lysimeters for monitoring spatio-temporal variability in SM, and calibrating the Aquaflex. A dry down experiment was performed for investigating the root depth of the pasture. All TDR probes responded to wetting and drying events, with varying SM measurements both vertically and horizontally, due to variations in soil type at different locations, indicating a need of SM monitoring at different locations in the paddock for irrigation scheduling. There was a strong linear relationship between the Aquaflex and TDR probes readings, which can be used to calibrate the Aquflex and improve its reliability for measuring soil moisture and in turn irrigation needs. Over the dry down period, out of the total moisture change in the 0-900-mm soil profile, 96% was contributed by 0-500 mm, indicating that the significant root depth of the pasture lies on the top 500-mm soil profile. Findings of the study can contribute to better irrigation scheduling and to conserve water.

AB  - Determining potassium supply of soil plays an important role in intensive crop production, since it is the basis for balancing nutrients and issuing fertilizer recommendations for achieving high and stable yields within economic feasibility. The aim of this study was to compare the different extraction methods of soil potassium from arable horizon of different types of soils with ammonium lactate method (K-AL), which is frequently used as analytical method for determining the accessibility of nutrients and it is a common method used for issuing fertilizer recommendations in many Europe countries. In addition to the ammonium lactate method (K-AL, pH 3.75), potassium was extracted with ammonium acetate (K-AA, pH 7), ammonium acetate ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (K-AAEDTA, pH 4.6), Bray (K-BRAY, pH 2.6) and with barium chloride (, pH 8.1). The analyzed soils were extremely heterogeneous with a wide range of determined values. Soil pH reaction ranged from 4.77 to 8.75, organic matter content ranged from 1.87 to 4.94% and clay content from 8.03 to 37.07%. In relation to K-AL method as the standard method, method extracts 12.9% more on average of soil potassium, while in relation to standard method, on average K-AA extracts 5.3%, K-AAEDTA 10.3%, and K-BRAY 27.5% less of potassium. Comparison of analyzed extraction methods of potassium from the soil is of high precision, and most reliable comparison was K-AL method with K-AAEDTA, followed by a: K-AA, and K-BRAY method. Extremely significant statistical correlation between different extractive methods for determining potassium in the soil indicates that any of the methods can be used to accurately predict the concentration of potassium in the soil, and that carried out research can be used to create prediction model for concentration of potassium based on different methods of extraction.

AB  - Accurate prediction and mapping of soil nutrient levels are essential for implementing variable rate technology. For the prediction of soil potassium (K), we evaluated the performance of the inverse distance weight of powers 1, 2, and 3, ordinary kriging, cokriging, multiple linear regression assuming independent error, and multiple linear regression with autocorrelated error structure. Two forms of ordinary kriging were evaluated: kriging the residuals from a trend surface regression (geographic locations only as predictors) and kriging the residuals from a regression of K on geographic location and other soil property predictors (soil pH and apparent electrical conductivity, ECa). The autocorrelated error model as implemented in the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) mixed linear model was employed to adjust for autocorrelated error structure in the regression models used for prediction. For cokriging, either soil ECa or soil pH was used as a secondary soil property to predict K. The root mean square error (RMSE) and mean error (ME) calculated from an independent validation data set (n = 68) were used as comparison criteria. The best result was obtained with the methods that incorporated geographic locations, other soil property predictors, and the correlated error structure. This investigation demonstrated the flexibility of the regression-based autocorrelated error model for spatial prediction compared with other methods. Further, the results of this study have important implications for screening economically acceptable soil and site characteristics that can be used to improve prediction of soil nutrients at unsampled locations within a field.

AB  - Priestley and Taylor's (1972) equation to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) stands for its simple form and data requirement. Although the original equation was developed for saturated surfaces, it has been widely extended to unsaturated surfaces. In this paper, different hypotheses to modify Priestley and Taylor's equation for unsaturated surfaces are compared. In general, ET models for unsaturated surfaces assume that the process is ruled by the available radiant energy and surface moisture or the atmospheric conditions or both surface and air states. The results presented here suggest that both atmospheric and surface variables should be jointly parameterized in order to obtain estimates with errors lower than 20%, which are common in ground observations. While surface condition parameterizations alone, such as those proposed by Barton (1979) and Jiang and Islam (2001), show errors slightly larger than 20%, unaided atmospheric parameterization results in errors of about 50% of the mean ET. Our recently proposed model, with atmospheric and surface parameters, keeps the simple form of Priestley and Taylor's original equation while benefiting from remotely sensed data. Estimates with our model would have errors lower than 20%.

AB  - A zero-dimension hydrological model has been developed to simulate the discharge (Q) from watershed groundwater storage(S). The model is a modified version of the original model developed by Kirchner in 2009 which uses a unique sensitivity function, g(Q) to represent the relation between rate of flow recession and the instantaneous flow rate. The modified dynamic model instead uses a normalized sensitivity function g(Q or,) which provides the model the flexibility to encompass the hysteretic effect of initial water storage on flow during recession periods. The sensitivity function is normalized based on a correlation function F(Q) which implicitly quantifies the influence of initial storage conditions on recession flow dynamics. For periods of either positive or negative net recharge to groundwater the model applies a term similar in form to an analytical solution based on solution to the linearized Boussinesq equation. The combination of these two streamflow components, the recession component and the net recharge response, provides the model with the flexibility to realistically mimic the hysteresis in the Q vs. S relations for a watershed. The model is applied to the Sagehen Creek watershed, a hilly watershed located in the Sierra Mountains of California. The results show that the modified model has an improved performance to simulate the discharge dynamic encompassing a wide range of water storage (degree of wetness) representing an almost ten-fold variation in annual streamflow.

AB  - Irrigation practices change the soil moisture in agricultural fields and influence emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). A 2 yr field study was conducted to assess carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from surface and subsurface drip irrigated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) fields on a loamy sand in southern Ontario. Surface and subsurface drip irrigation are common irrigation practices used by tomato growers in southern Ontario. The N2O fluxes were generally <= 50 mu g N2O-N m(-2)h(-1), with mean cumulative emissions ranging between 352 +/- 83 and 486 +/- 138 mg N2O-N m(-2). No significant difference in N2O emissions between the two drip irrigation practices was found in either study year. Mean CO2 fluxes ranged from 22 to 160 mg CO2-C m(2) h(-1) with cumulative fluxes between 188 +/- 42 and 306 +/- 31 g CO2-C m(-2). Seasonal CO2 emissions from surface drip irrigation were significantly greater than subsurface drip irrigation in both years, likely attributed to sampling time temperature differences. We conclude that these irrigation methods did not have a direct effect on the GHG emissions from tomato fields in this study. Therefore, both irrigation methods are expected to have similar environmental impacts and are recommended to growers.

AB  - Presently, rice-fallows are targeted for cropping intensification in South Asia. Rice-fallows a rainfed mono-cropping system remain fallow after rice due to lack of irrigation facilities and poor socio-economic condition of the farmers. Nevertheless, there is the scope of including ecologically adaptable winter crops in water-limited rice-fallow conditions with effective moisture conservation practices. The study aimed to identify the winter-crops that are adaptable and productive in rice-fallow conditions and to evaluate the different tillage-based crop establishment practices for soil moisture conservation, grain yield, economics, and sustainability parameters. Six different crop establishment and residue management (CERM) practices viz., zero-tillage direct seeded rice (ZTDSR), zero-tillage transplanted rice (ZTTPR), puddled transplanted rice (PTR), ZTDSR with rice residue retention (ZTDSR(R+)), ZTTPR with rice residue retention (ZTTPR(R+)), PTR with rice residue retention (PTRR+) as main-plot treatment and five winter crops (chickpea, lentil, safflower, linseed, and mustard) as sub-plot treatment were evaluated in a split-plot design. The productivity of grain legumes (chickpea and lentil) was higher over oilseed crops in rice-fallow conditions with an order of chickpea>lentil>safflower>mustard>linseed. Among the CERM practices, ZTDSR(R+) and ZTDSR treatments increased the grain yield of all the winter crops over PTR treatment, which was primarily attributed to higher soil moisture retention for an extended period. Grain yield increment with conservation tillage practices was highly prominent in safflower (190%) followed by lentil (93%) and chickpea (70%). Rice grain yield was higher (7-35%) under PTR treatment followed by ZTDSR treatment. Conservation tillage practices (ZTDSR, ZTTPR) reduced energy use (11-20%) and increased the energy ratio over conventional tillage practice (PTR), higher in rice-safflower, rice-lentil and rice-chickpea rotations. Higher net return was attained in rice-safflower and rice-chickpea rotations with ZTDSR(R+) treatment. Predicted emission of greenhouse gases was markedly reduced in ZTDSR treatment (30%) compared to ZTTPR and PTR treatments. Hence, the study suggests that cropping intensification of rice-fallows with the inclusion of winter crops like chickpea, lentil, and safflower following conservation tillage practices (ZTDSR(R+) in particular) could be the strategic options for achieving the higher system productivity, economic returns, and energy use efficiency with the reduced emission of greenhouse gases.

AB  - The use of no tillage (NT) integrated with cover cropping is a management practice that is becoming more popular with commercial 'jack-o-lantern' pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) growers in the eastern and midwestern United States, although little is known about nitrogen (N) fertilizer requirements for this production system. A field study was established at the Southern Illinois University Horticulture Research Center in Carbondale to evaluate the yield response of pumpkin and associated revenues to N fertilization in a NT production system after wheat (Triticum aestivum) harvest. Nitrogen application rate affected pumpkin leaf chlorophyll content, and resulting yields and revenues. At all sampling dates, pumpkin fertilized with 224 kg.ha(-1) N had the greatest leaf chlorophyll content. Quadratic relationships best described pumpkin fruit size and diameter increase with N rates from 0 to 224 kg.ha(-1). Furthermore, pumpkin fruit number and weight per hectare also increased in a quadratic manner, as N application rates increased from 0 to 224 kg.ha(-1). The application of 168 kg.ha(-1) N also provided high yields and large fruit sizes, although quadratic models indicated that maximum net revenues for NT pumpkins were achieved with 224 kg.ha(-1) N. Growers applying 224 kg.ha(-1) N would increase net revenues by '54%, 52%, and 51% at pumpkin fruit price points of $0.33, $0.44, $0.55 per kg, respectively, compared with 0 kg.ha(-1) N fertilization. An additional 123 kg.ha(-1) N from fertilizer was required for NT pumpkin production after wheat harvest in fields with high amounts of cereal straw residues on the soil surface compared with the 101 kg.ha(-1) N recommended for conventional tillage systems with no cover crop residues. This study suggests that N fertilizer investments will provide significant monetary returns in NT pumpkin systems. However, the 168 kg.ha(-1) N rate provided the highest return on fertilizer investment at all pumpkin pricing points compared with all other N rates evaluated. Additionally, pumpkins grown in NT systems using a winter grain crop that is ended at flowering should require similar N amounts, because little N is used during heading and grain ripening. Although growers often look for ways to reduce input costs in vegetable production systems, N fertilization is clearly an important investment that provides increased yields and revenues in NT pumpkins. The results of this study should provide additional information to establish N fertilizer recommendations for NT pumpkin production.

AB  - The need to develop and provide integrated observation systems to better understand and manage global and regional environmental change is one of the major challenges facing Earth system science today. In 2008, the German Helmholtz Association took up this challenge and launched the German research infrastructure TERrestrial ENvironmental Observatories (TERENO). The aim of TERENO is the establishment and maintenance of a network of observatories as a basis for an interdisciplinary and long-term research program to investigate the effects of global environmental change on terrestrial ecosystems and their socio-economic consequences. State-of-the-art methods from the field of environmental monitoring, geophysics, remote sensing, and modeling are used to record and analyze states and fluxes in different environmental disciplines from groundwater through the vadose zone, surface water, and biosphere, up to the lower atmosphere. Over the past 15 years we have collectively gained experience in operating a long-term observing network, thereby overcoming unexpected operational and institutional challenges, exceeding expectations, and facilitating new research. Today, the TERENO network is a key pillar for environmental modeling and forecasting in Germany, an information hub for practitioners and policy stakeholders in agriculture, forestry, and water management at regional to national levels, a nucleus for international collaboration, academic training and scientific outreach, an important anchor for large-scale experiments, and a trigger for methodological innovation and technological progress. This article describes TERENO's key services and functions, presents the main lessons learned from this 15-year effort, and emphasizes the need to continue long-term integrated environmental monitoring programmes in the future.
   This paper discusses the importance of creating comprehensive environmental observation systems to better understand and address global and regional environmental changes. In 2008, a German research infrastructure named Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) was established to build and maintain a network of observatories. The goal is to conduct interdisciplinary, long-term research on the impacts of global environmental changes on terrestrial ecosystems and their socio-economic effects. The TERENO network employs advanced methods from environmental monitoring, geophysics, remote sensing, and modeling to study various environmental aspects. Over the past 15 years, four observatories have been part of this network, contributing to valuable experience in overcoming challenges and exceeding expectations. Today, TERENO is a crucial component for environmental modeling and forecasting in Germany, serving as an information hub for practitioners and policymakers.

AB  - Alley cropping systems may prevent soil and water erosion. The objective of this paper was to assess the effects of antecedent soil moisture on runoff and soil loss in alley cropping systems. Five land use treatments with three replications were included in this study. The treatments were mono peanut cropping (P), younger trees (T-1), older trees (T-2), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) intercropped with younger trees (T1P), and peanut intercropped with older trees (T2P). The trees used were deciduous Choerospondias axillaris. Runoff and soil loss from the experimental plots were monitored and related to rainfall and antecedent soil water potential. Results showed that T-1 and T-2 produced the highest runoff and lowest soil loss while P produced the greatest soil loss. Soil loss was 25.3% less in T1P and 32.0% in T2P than in P. Runoff was 62.6% less in T1P than in T-1 and 56.1% less in T2P than in T-2. Regardless of land use, soil loss was more closely correlated to runoff than to rainfall (R > 0.95 versus R < 0.40). Runoff and soil loss varied with season and antecedent soil moisture. The largest amounts of runoff and soil loss were recorded in the soil water surplus phase (rainy season). In spite of less rainfall in the soil water deficit phase, soil loss was greater than that in the soil water recovery phase. The runoff coefficient was exponentially correlated to the inverse of antecedent soil water potential in the rainy season, while the runoff coefficient was negatively and linearly correlated to antecedent soil water potential in the dry season. These results suggest that saturation excess runoff may be dominant in the rainy season and infiltration excess runoff may become dominant in the dry season. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Crop rotation, cover crops introduction and no tillage adoption have improved tropical agriculture sustainability through improvements on soil conservation and water use efficiency. Soil fertility and topsoil phosphorus (P) accumulation is also altered by management, affecting P dynamics and its use for subsequent cash crops. Changes in soil P fractions promoted by no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) in soybean/cotton crop systems with different cover crop rotations (fallow, maize as second crop, brachiaria and millet) were investigated in two long-term trials in Brazilian Oxisols (Ox-1 and Ox-2), and compared to soils under native Cerrado vegetation. Hedley's P fractionation was performed in soil samples taken from 0 to 5, 5 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depth layers and P fractions grouped by their predicted lability. Long-term cultivation generated large amounts of legacy P in the soil (184-341 mg kg(-1)) but only a small portion remained in labile fractions (11-16 %), with a slight increase in non-labile P (< 5 %) and organic P (10-20 %) concentrations under NT when compared to CT. Although the soil P remained mostly in less available fractions, the legacy P obtained by the difference between the soil P data from the agricultural land and the native area provided a useful approach for P accumulation estimative over the time, very close to the predicted P inputs/outputs accounting. Brachiaria recycled more P than other cover crops, increasing the labile P (5-20 %) and all the organic P fractions (10-25 %) over the time.

AB  - Many rainfed wheat production systems are reliant on stored soil water for some or all of their water inputs. Selection and breeding for root traits could result in a yield benefit; however, breeding for root traits has traditionally been avoided due to the difficulty of phenotyping mature root systems, limited understanding of root system development and function, and the strong influence of environmental conditions on the phenotype of the mature root system. This paper outlines an international field selection program for beneficial root traits at maturity using soil coring in India and Australia. In the rainfed areas of India, wheat is sown at the end of the monsoon into hot soils with a quickly receding soil water profile; in season water inputs are minimal. We hypothesised that wheat selected and bred for high yield under these conditions would have deep, vigorous root systems, allowing them to access and utilise the stored soil water at depth around anthesis and grain-filling when surface layers were dry. The Indian trials resulted in 49 lines being sent to Australia for phenotyping. These lines were ranked against 41 high yielding Australian lines. Variation was observed for deep root traits e.g. in eastern Australia in 2012, maximum depth ranged from 118.8 to 146.3 cm. There was significant variation for root traits between sites and years, however, several Indian genotypes were identified that consistently ranked highly across sites and years for deep rooting traits.

AB  - Contour hedgerow intercropping systems have been proposed as an alternative to traditional agricultural practice with a single crop, as they are effective in reducing run-off and soil erosion. However, competition for water and nutrients between crops and associated hedgerows may reduce the overall performance of these systems. To get a more detailed understanding of the competition for water, spatially resolved monitoring of soil water contents in the soil-plant-atmosphere system is necessary. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is potentially a valuable technique to monitor changes in soil moisture in space andtime. In this study, the performance of different ERT electrode arrays to detect the soil moisture dynamics in a mono-and an intercropping system was tested. Their performance was analyzed based on a synthetic study using geophysical measures, such as data recovery and resolution, and using spatial statistics of retrieved water content, such as an adjusted coefficient of variation and semivariances. The synthetic ERT measurements detected differences between the cropping systems and retrieved spatial structure of the soil moisture distribution, but the variance and semivariance were underestimated. Sharp water content contrasts between horizons or in the neighborhood of a root water uptake bulb were smoothened. The addition of electrodes deeper in the soil improved the performance, but sometimes only marginally. ERT is therefore a valuable tool for soil moisture monitoring in the field under different cropping systems if an electrode array is used which can resolve the patterns expected to be present in the medium. The use of spatial statistics allowed to not only identify the overall model recovery, but also to quantify the recovery of spatial structures.

AB  - The importance of soil phosphorus (P) is likely to increase in coming decades due to the growing atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition originated by industrial and agricultural activities. We currently lack a proper understanding of the main drivers of soil P pools in coastal dunes, which rank among the most valued priority conservation areas worldwide. Here, we evaluated the joint effects of biotic (i.e. microbial abundance and richness, vegetation and cryptogams cover) and abiotic (i.e. pH and aridity) factors on labile, medium-lability and recalcitrant soil P pools across a wide aridity gradient in the Atlantic coast of the Iberian Peninsula. Climate determined the availability of medium-lability, recalcitrant and total P, but had a minor net effect on labile P, which was positively and significantly related to the presence of plants, mosses and lichens. Medium-lability P was significantly influenced by soil bacterial richness and abundance (positively and negatively, respectively). Our results suggest that micro-organisms transfer P from medium-lability pool to more labile one. At the same time, increases in bacterial richness associated to biofilms might be involved in the thickening of the medium-lability P pool in our climosequence. These bacterial-mediated transfers would confer resistance to the labile P pool under future climate change and uncover an important role of soil micro-organisms as modulators of the geochemical P cycle.

AB  - Shifts in precipitation regimes are an inherent component of climate change, but in low-energy systems are often assumed to be less important than changes in temperature. Because soil moisture is the hydrological variable most proximally linked to plant performance during the growing season in arctic-alpine habitats, it may offer the most useful perspective on the influence of changes in precipitation on vegetation. Here we quantify the influence of soil moisture for multiple vegetation properties at fine spatial scales, to determine the potential importance of soil moisture under changing climatic conditions. A fine-scale data set, comprising vascular species cover and field-quantified ecologically relevant environmental parameters, was analysed to determine the influence of soil moisture relative to other key abiotic predictors. Soil moisture was strongly related to community composition, species richness and the occurrence patterns of individual species, having a similar or greater influence than soil temperature, pH and solar radiation. Soil moisture varied considerably over short distances, and this fine-scale heterogeneity may contribute to offsetting the ecological impacts of changes in precipitation for species not limited to extreme soil moisture conditions. In conclusion, soil moisture is a key driver of vegetation properties, both at the species and community level, even in this low-energy system. Soil moisture conditions represent an important mechanism through which changing climatic conditions impact vegetation, and advancing our predictive capability will therefore require a better understanding of how soil moisture mediates the effects of climate change on biota.

AB  - Mid-infrared spectroscopy has been proposed as a cheap yet accurate alternative to a number of laboratory methods for measuring soil properties. While accurate predictions of a number of basic soil constituents have been reported, properties associated with soil structure have received far less attention. In this study, we looked at the efficacy of mid-infrared reflectance spectroscopy in predicting moisture retention and whether better predictions can be achieved using pedotransfer functions using spectroscopic predictions of basic soil constituents as inputs. Three methods were used to predict volumetric moisture retention: (i) mid-infrared (MIR) spectra and partial least squares regression, (ii) a neural network pedotransfer function (PTF) using laboratory particle-size distribution and bulk density data, and (iii) a pedotransfer function with MIR-predicted particle-size distribution and bulk density as inputs. We used Lin's concordance correlation coefficient as a goodness-of-fir measure. Predictions of volumetric moisture retention on intact structured soils were generally poor, particularly at the wet end. Improved predictions were observed at dry-end matric potentials, where moisture retention was more correlated with particle-size distribution than soil structure. The neural network PTF was found to have better goodness of fit for all matric potentials; however, predictions at larger matric potentials (wet end) were still poor due to poor bulk density predictions. In light of this work, we propose that while MIR spectroscopy may be a valuable predictor of fundamental soil constituents such as particle-size fractions and organic C, predictions of soil properties dependant on soil structure, such as volumetric moisture retention, may prove difficult. Mid-infrared spectroscopy in combination with PTFs should provide improvements to moisture retention predictions through improved representation of the influential processes, namely soil structure and adsorptive forces.

AB  - Path analysis applied to sequential chemical fractionation of Hedley may improve our understanding on the linkage between P forms and its availability in soils. In this work, we assessed the role of Hedley-P fractions in buffering Resin-P (a plant-available soil P index) in a very clayey Oxisol (720 g kg(-1) clay) and the validity of the postulated causal models for two long-term (23-yr) tillage systems (conventional-CT and no-till-NT) by path analysis. The model that accounted for the path from the less labile organic and inorganic P fractions to more labile ones, and from these fractions to the Resin-P showed the highest p value in NT (p = 0.36) and CT (p = 0.05), showing that the proposed models are a plausible representation of the tested causal relationships. These models explained 75 and 93% of Resin-P (U = 0.25 and 0.07) in CT and NT systems, respectively. The buffering flux of organic fractions was more pronounced in NT. However, the organic P pool has a higher direct contribution to buffer Resin-P in CT (94%) than in NT (35%), due to higher mineralization of organic P forms with moderate lability caused by soil disturbance. On the other hand, in the long-term NT, moderate inorganic P showed a high contribution to directly buffer Resin-P (40%). Although inorganic P associated with Ca is a very small fraction of P in strongly weathered soils, the path analysis showed that this fraction was a direct source of P in both soil tillage systems, but it was more important source to buffer Resin-P in NT (16.7%) than in CT (1.9%) due to the higher P content and path coefficient of this fraction in NT. Residual organic and inorganic P fraction were not related to any fraction of P, indicating that these fractions were neither a sink nor a source of P in both tillage systems, or that they become a temporary source and sink at the same time in the long-term experiment. The path analysis showed to be an important tool to interpret the results obtained in sequential chemical fractionation of P, improving our understanding of the soil P dynamics in contrasting tillage systems.

AB  - The suitability of different exchange protocols for soil nutrient analysis by means of ion chromatography was compared. In contrast to photometric methods, ion chromatography provides the possibility to quantify several ions out of the same exchange solution in one analytic step. A new developed lithium acetate exchange protocol provided the best results as none of the main nutrient ions is precipitated and neither lithium nor acetate are of interest in general surveys and the exchange characteristics are expected to be similar to those of plant ion exchange.

AB  - The combination of wireless sensor networks and radio technology can form a new type of communication network. The emergence of wireless sensor networks has effectively solved the problems existing in radio technology, but traditional wireless sensor networks and radio technology networks cannot be directly applied to wireless sensors. On this basis, this paper studies the remote sensing of soil nutrient variability in agricultural land using wireless sensors. Due to traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil nutrient variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess nutrients, reducing the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting high-quality farmland. Traditional farming methods can no longer meet the requirements, and modern technology must be used to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients during plant growth. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, speed, economy, and regular monitoring. It provides new ideas and technical guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land development and consolidation projects. This paper also studies the use of statistical quantitative evaluation technology to carry out multidimensional statistical quantification of soil protection function evaluation at a given location. Finally, wireless sensor networks are used to analyze the relationship between several natural factors and quantitative estimation of soil protection. Based on wireless sensor technology, this paper studies the variability of farmland soil nutrients and statistical quantitative evaluation, hoping to lay a foundation for the development of agriculture and statistics.

AB  - A number of geophysical methods, such as ground-penetrating radar (GPR), have the potential to provide valuable information on hydrological properties in the unsaturated zone. In particular, the stochastic inversion of such data within a coupled geophysical-hydrological framework may allow for the effective estimation of vadose zone hydraulic parameters and their corresponding uncertainties. A critical issue in stochastic inversion is choosing prior parameter probability distributions from which potential model configurations are drawn and tested against observed data. A well chosen prior should reflect as honestly as possible the initial state of knowledge regarding the parameters and be neither overly specific nor too conservative. In a Bayesian context, combining the prior with available data yields a posterior state of knowledge about the parameters, which can then be used statistically for predictions and risk assessment. Here we investigate the influence of prior information regarding the van Genuchten-Mualem (VGM) parameters, which describe vadose zone hydraulic properties, on the stochastic inversion of crosshole GPR data collected under steady state, natural-loading conditions. We do this using a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) inversion approach, considering first noninformative uniform prior distributions and then more informative priors derived from soil property databases. For the informative priors, we further explore the effect of including information regarding parameter correlation. Analysis of both synthetic and field data indicates that the geophysical data alone contain valuable information regarding the VGM parameters. However, significantly better results are obtained when we combine these data with a realistic, informative prior.

AB  - It is challenging to integrate porous graphene foam (GF) and GF-based nanocomposites into microfluidic channels and even create microfluidic structures within these materials. This is because their irregular interior pore shape and geometry, rough exterior surface, and relatively large material thickness make it difficult to perform conventional photolithography and etching. This challenge has largely hindered the potential of using GF-based materials in microfluidics-based sensors. Here we present a simple approach to create well-defined flow-through channels within or across the GF-based materials, using a liquid-phase photopolymerization method. This method allows embedding of a nanocomposite-based scaffold of GF and titanium nitride nanofibers (GF-TiN NFs) into a channel structure, to realize flow-through microfluidic electrochemical sensors for detecting nitrate ions in agricultural soils. The unique GF-TiN nanocomposite provides high electrochemical reactivity, high electron transfer rate, improved loading capacity of receptor biomolecules, and large surface area, serving as an efficient electrochemical sensing interface with the help of immobilized specific enzyme molecules. The microfluidic sensor provides an ultralow limit of detection of 0.01 mg L-1, a wide dynamic range from 0.01 to 442 mg L-1, and a high sensitivity of 683.3 mu A mg(-1) L cm(-2) for nitrate ions in real soil solution samples. The advantageous features of the GF-TiN nanocomposite, in conjunction with the in situ integration approach, will enable a promising microfluidic sensor platform to monitor soil ions for nutrient management towards sustainable agriculture.

AB  - Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) hyperspectral data can provide accurate and detailed spectral information on the surface of features, leading to a better understanding of the physiological characteristics and optical properties of objects. Compared to satellite hyperspectral, UAV hyperspectral has a greater image spatial resolution, but it also collects more impurity information along with more image detail information. The nitrogen (N) content in shallow soils is of great significance for crop growth, and most of its remote sensing inversions are currently based on satellite images, whereas relatively few studies have used hyperspectral UAV images in the near-infrared band for inversions. Based on this, we propose a high-accuracy inversion model based on UAV hyper-spectral imagery using an elastic net (EN) dimensionality reduction algorithm combined with a decision tree (DT) model. In this study, a hyperspectral imager carried by a drone was used to acquire the surface soil spectral data of winter wheat in the study area after sowing and fertilizing, and the measured N content of the sampled soil was determined by chemical analysis methods. We used various pre-processing methods to denoise and reduce the dimensionality of the original hyperspectral images and utilized a DT regression model to construct an inversion model of N content with different preprocessing results. Then we compared the accuracy of the models and used the optimal model to obtain the spatial distribution map of soil N content in the study area. The results show that (1) the dimensionality reduction of hyperspectral data can effectively remove redundant information and prevent data overfitting. Among them, the successive projections algorithm and correlation analysis method are more suitable for analyzing pre-processed spectral data, whereas the Lasso and EN algorithms are more suitable for processing original spectral data. (2) For the original spectral images, the EN dimensionality reduction algorithm (R2 of the EN-Unt-DT inversion model is 0.930, RMSE is 0.045) performed better than the other three algorithms. For the pre-processed spectral images, the successive projections algorithm (R2 of the SPA-Pre-DT inversion model is 0.906, RMSE is 0.055) performed better than the other three algorithms. The constructed EN-Unt-DT inversion model had the highest fitting accuracy. The research results provide a corre-sponding technical reference for the inversion of soil N content using UAV NIR hyperspectral data.

AB  - Appropriate use of N fertilizer for irrigated corn increases the yield and the economic return, and it also reduces the risk of water pollution. The objective of this study was to determine corn response to nitrogen. The field experiment was carried out on a clayey typic Haplustox, using a complete split-plot randomized block design with four replications. Nitrogen rates (0, 60, 120,180 and 240 kg ha(-1)N as urea, in dress application split through the season) were the main plots and the rotation cropping systems, corn-corn-corn and corn-soybean-corn, were the split-plots. Nitrogen fertilization increases the corn yield in 28% in relation to control. Greatest grain yield, 11,203 kg ha(-1), was obtained with the highest N rate (240 kg ha(-1)). There was no effect of cropping system in grain yield, but N content in shoot dry matter and in corn grains were larger in corn-soybean-corn system.

AB  - Estimation of overland precipitation using observations from the radar and passive microwave radiometer sensors onboard the current Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) and predecessor Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellites is constrained by the underlying surface variability. The factors controlling the multichannel microwave surface emissivity and radar surface backscatter are related to surface properties such as soil type and vegetation properties that vary with location and time. Variability due to slowly varying seasonal changes can be considered when simulating radar reflectivities and radiometer equivalent blackbody brightness temperatures for use with precipitation retrieval algorithms. However, over certain surfaces, a more transient, dynamic surface change is manifested upon the onset of intermittent rain events. In these situations, a timely update of the surface state prior to each satellite overpass, together with knowledge of the associated variability in the emissivity and radar surface backscatter, may be useful to improve the performance of the overland precipitation retrieval algorithms. In this study, the potential for wide-swath surface backscatter observations from the Ku-band, dual-beam OceanSat-2 scatterometer (OSCAT) is examined as a surface reference for tracking previous-time precipitation. Over certain surfaces, it is shown that a time-change detection approach is useful to isolate the change in radar backscatter owing to previous 3-h rainfall accumulations from the more slowly varying background state. A practical use of this method would be the production of an ancillary previous-time precipitation map, which could be consulted by retrieval algorithms to select (or adjust the weighting of) candidate solutions that represent the most current surface conditions.

AB  - Rainfall infiltration into hillslopes on the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP) undergoes noticeable changes during the growing season following long-term revegetation. However, infiltration patterns during the non-growing season have been understudied. In this study, we monitored soil moisture over three years (May 2016-December 2018) at 10-minute intervals, spanning five soil depths (10, 20, 40, 60, and 100 cm). Monitoring was conducted in both a forestland catchment and an adjacent grassland catchment on the CLP, with two monitoring sites per catchment: one downhill in the gully, and the other uphill on the slope. Our findings reveal pronounced seasonal variations in meteorological conditions and vegetation index. We observed divergent rainfall infiltration patterns and their governing factors between the growing (May to October) and non-growing seasons (November to April). During the growing season, rainfall facilitated a quicker response with shorter lag time (23.34 h vs. 56.84 h in the non-growing season) and noticeable soil moisture increments (up to 35.7 % cm3/cm3 vs. only up to 6.4 % cm3/cm3). The wetting depth often extended to 40-100 cm (compared to 10-40 cm in the non-growing season), with a higher wetting front velocity (17.44 mm/h vs. 6.24 mm/h) and an increased occurrence frequency of preferential flow (19.77% vs. 9.72 %). The impact of rainfall amount and peak intensity on infiltration was more pronounced during the non-growing season, whereas, in the growing season, infiltration was additionally influenced by antecedent moisture conditions and vegetation type. Notably, in the growing season, the enhanced soil moisture recharge due to rainfall infiltration exceeded the rise in evapotranspiration, resulting in higher soil water storage. The findings of this study shed new light on seasonal infiltration dynamics on the greening CLP, contributing valuable insights into hillslope hydropedological processes post-revegetation.

AB  - Land-surface topographic attributes can be useful for estimating stable spatial patterns of crop yield caused by spatial variability in soils and water availability. We present spatial analyses of grain yield for three fields of dryland winter wheat in northeastern Colorado using topographic attributes as explanatory variables. Topographic attributes including elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, specific contributing area, and wetness index were computed from a 10-m digital elevation model. A Spatial Analysis Neural Network (SANN) algorithm was used for joint spatial interpolation and yield prediction from the topographic attributes. SANN prediction errors were compared with the results of Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). SANN and MLR were assessed in terms of bias and relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) using validation data. SANN out-performed MLR in multivariate estimation, but not for the univariate cases. The greatest advantage of SANN was seen using four or more topographic attributes, whereas MLR showed diminishing efficiency with more than three explanatory variables. Prediction/interpolation errors within a given field were reduced substantially by using the spatial coordinates (latitude and longitude) in tandem with topographic attributes. The rRMSE value reached a minimum of 0.44 (model efficiency, E=0.80) for interpolation with SANN on the West field. Using only topographic attributes as input, the minimum rRMSE values were 0.59 (E=0.65) for SANN with 5 variables and 0.72 (E=0.48) for MLR with 4 or 5 explanatory variables. Thus, this study demonstrated the utility of SANN with topographic attributes that contain implicit soil and water information for estimating spatial patterns of dryland crop yield.

AB  - Ammonium fixation and the effects of soil moisture and application methods on fertilizer N recovery were investigated in two soils of Shaanxi Province, China, a Luvisol and an Entisol, through two experiments performed in the laboratory and in a glass shelter, respectively, by using ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3). The laboratory closed incubation box experiment was conducted using the Luvisol to study NH4+ fixation rate at soil moisture levels of 10.1%, 22.7% and 35.3% water filled pore space (WFPS). The fixed NH4+-N increased dramatically to 51% and 66%, 67% and 74%, and 82% and 85% 1, 2 and 36 h after fertilizer incorporation at moisture levels of 10.1% and 22.7% WFPS and 35.3% WFPS, respectively. The rapid NH4+ fixation rates at all moisture levels could help prevent NH4+ losses from ammonia volatilization. In the glass shelter pot experiment, N fertilizer was applied by either banding (in a concentrated strip) or incorporating (thoroughly mixing) with the Entisol and the Luvisol. An average of 74.2% of the added N fertilizer was recovered 26 days after application to the Luvisol, while only 61.4% could be recovered from the Entisol, due to higher NH4+ fixation capacity of the Luvisol. The amount of fixed NH4+ decreased with increasing WFPS. The amount of fixed NH4+ in the incorporated fertilizer treatment was, on average, 10% higher than that in the banded treatment. Higher NH4+ fixation rates could prevent N loss and thus increase N recovery. The results from the Luvisol showed lower nitrogen recovery as soil moisture level increased, which could be explained by the fact that most of the fixed NH4+ was still not released when the soil moisture level was low. When the fertilizer was incorporated into the soil, the recovery of N increased, compared with the banded treatment, by an average of 26.2% in the Luvisol and 11.2% in the Entisol, which implied that when farmers applied fertilizer, it would be best to mix it well with the soil.

AB  - Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech farm supervision cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing are anticipated to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artificial intelligence in farming. Such ground-breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also presenting a range of challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications of wireless sensors in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology with conventional farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers during crop periods from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also investigated.

AB  - The most significant biotic and abiotic stress agents of water extremity, salinity, and infection lead to wood decay and modifications of moisture and ion content, and density. This strongly influences the (di-)electrical and mechanical properties and justifies the application of geophysical imaging techniques. These are less invasive and have high resolution in contrast to classical methods of destructive, single-point measurements for inspecting stresses in trees and soils. This review presents some in situ and in vivo applications of electric, radar, and seismic methods for studying water status and movement in soils, roots, and tree trunks. The electrical properties of a root-zone are a consequence of their moisture content. Electrical imaging discriminates resistive, woody roots from conductive, soft roots. Both types are recognized by low radar velocities and high attenuation. Single roots can generate diffraction hyperbolas in radargrams. Pedophysical relationships of water content to electrical resistivity and radar velocity are established by diverse infiltration experiments in the field, laboratory, and in the full-scale 'GeoModel' at Kiel University. Subsurface moisture distributions are derived from geophysical attribute models. The ring electrode technique around trunks images the growth ring structure of concentric resistivity, which is inversely proportional to the fluid content. Healthy trees show a central high resistivity within the dry heartwood that strongly decreases towards the peripheral wet sapwood. Observed structural deviations are caused by infection, decay, shooting, or predominant light and/or wind directions. Seismic trunk tomography also differentiates between decayed and healthy woods.

AB  - Globally, the proportion of total rainfall occurring as extreme events is increasing, which may have consequences for agriculture. In the US Midwest, we conducted a 234-d manipulative experiment in 16 paired plots where we increased the proportion of rain falling in extreme events on tilled and no-till cropping systems. We compared the effects of larger, less frequent rain events ("intensified" rainfall) vs. smaller, more frequent rain events ("normal" rainfall) on soil water content and deep percolation. The effect of intensified rainfall on the volumetric water content (VWC) of soil at the 10-cm depth during the experiment varied seasonally: in spring, intensified rainfall decreased the average VWC at the 10-cm depth by 0.05 +/- 0.01 cm(3) cm(-3) compared with normal rainfall, but in summer and fall, it had no effect. In soil at the 100-cm depth, VWC declined during the summer in normal but not intensified plots. A surface-added Br- tracer was detected and peaked earlier in soil water at 120 cm under intensified rainfall vs. normal rainfall (by 6 +/- 3 and 74 +/- 33 d, respectively) regardless of tillage, although it was detected sooner in no-till than tilled systems (by 9 +/- 3 d). Also, less Br- was recovered in soil under intensified (8 +/- 8% of total Br- added) vs. normal rainfall (21 +/- 3%). Our results suggest that rainfall intensification will increase deep percolation and deep soil water content in cropping systems regardless of tillage. Such changes to soil water dynamics may alter plant water and nutrient availability.

AB  - Nine pasture treatments differing in species composition were monitored for changes in soil water content at a depth of 0.10-1.70 m, at 2 sites (Kamarah and Junee), in the wheatbelt of eastern Australia. Treatments containing perennial species, viz. lucerne (Medicago sativa L.), phalaris (Phalaris aquatica L.), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L.), mixture (lucerne + phalaris + cocksfoot), wallaby grass (Austrodanthonia richardsonii Cashmore.), and lovegrass (Eragrostis curvula (Schrader) Nees.), were sown with subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.). In addition, 3 treatments based solely on annual species were examined: subterranean clover (sown by itself and kept weed-free with herbicides), annual (sown to subterranean clover but weed invasion not controlled), and serradella (Ornithopus compressus L.). The experiment was conducted from 1994-97 at the Junee site (annual average rainfall 550 mm/year) and from 1995-97 at the Kamarah site (annual average rainfall 450 mm per year).
   At the higher rainfall site (Junee), there were few differences among pasture types in soil water content to 0.70 m. Below 0.70 m the soil pro. le was drier under all the perennial swards than under the annual pasture treatments by the end of the 4-year pasture phase. At the drier Kamarah site, where the pasture phase was shorter due to an initial sowing failure, all the perennials, except cocksfoot, dried the pro. le below 1.05 m. At both sites, lucerne dried the 1.05-1.70 m section of the soil pro. le more rapidly than the other perennials, which apparently took longer to reach this depth.
   At the Junee site, the soilwater deficit in May (SWD(MAY), defined as field capacity (mm) - stored soilwater (mm) at the beginning of May) was largest in the phalaris, mixture, lucerne, and cocksfoot treatments (155 - 162 mm), whereas as under a pasture of subterranean clover alone, SWD(MAY) was only 89 mm. At the drier Kamarah site, the largest SWD(MAY) was created by the lovegrass (114 mm) and lucerne (107 mm) treatments. The cocksfoot and subterranean clover treatments created the smallest SWD(MAY) at this site, at 79 and 72 mm, respectively.
   The study showed that currently available C-3 and C-4 perennial grasses can be as effective as lucerne in drying the soil pro. le to 1.70 m in the 450-600 mm rainfall areas of the southern NSW wheatbelt, creating a dry soil buffer to reduce the risk of deep drainage during subsequent cropping phases. As the rate at which grasses dried the pro. le was slower than lucerne, pastures based on perennial grasses may have to be retained longer to achieve the same level of dewatering.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of various root- zone construction methods and irrigation systems on soil moisture distribution and retention in sports field soils under greenhouse conditions. The goal was to identify how these factors can be harmonized to enhance irrigation efficiency and develop sustainable, environmentally resilient turf- grass areas. The experiment involved 2- and 3-layered root- zones, irrigated using both sprinkler and subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems. Eighteen plots were set up in a greenhouse, each receiving 10 L m-2-2 h-1-1 of water for 1 or 2 hours via SDI or sprinkler. Soil moisture was monitored at different depths and times to assess the distribution and retention patterns. Results showed that both the rootzone construction and irrigation system significantly influenced soil moisture behavior. Sprinkler irrigation led to a quick moisture increase followed by a sharp decline due to high percolation and low retention. In contrast, SDI caused minimal changes, especially in near-surface areas, due to insufficient upward water movement. The 2-layered SDI setup, even with doubled irrigation, did not enhance capillary rise or humidification in the main rooting zone up to 12 cm depth. However, the 3-layered SDI variant demonstrated a more effective capillary rise, resulting in even moisture distribution and better water retention. At 12 cm depth, the 3-layered SDI setup maintained higher residual moisture than other variants. This suggests that the benefits of SDI are most pronounced in 3-layer constructions or other setups that adequately account for capillary rise in the root zone. The findings indicate that a hybrid approach combining SDI and sprinkler systems could effectively meet the dual requirements of sports fields: sufficient near-surface humidification for turfgrass establishment and efficient water resource utilization.

AB  - Soil moisture is an important state variable in the terrestrial system because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the land surface and the atmosphere. In this study, we review recent advances in noninvasive techniques that allow continuous noninvasive and contactless measurements of soil moisture dynamics at the field to basin scale. In particular, we report on (1) cosmic-ray neutron probes, (2) Global Navigation Satellite System reflectometry, (3) ground-based microwave radiometry, (4) gamma-ray monitoring, (5) terrestrial gravimetry, and (6) low-frequency electromagnetic surface waves. Each method is described in terms of its basic principle, measurement scales, calibration issues, measurement accuracy, and applications. We hope that this review will further stimulate the community to invest in the continued development of novel soil moisture sensing methods that address the need for large-scale soil water content measurements with sufficiently high temporal resolution.

AB  - Resource availability may influence invertebrate communities, with important consequences for ecosystem function, such as biomass production. We assessed: (1) the effects of experimental soil nutrient additions on invertebrate abundances and feeding rates and (2) the resultant changes in the effects of invertebrates on aboveground plant biomass at three grassland sites spanning the North American Central Plains, across which plant tissue chemistry and biomass vary. Invertebrate communities and rates of herbivory were sampled within a long-term nutrient-addition experiment established at each site along the broad Central Plains precipitation gradient. Additionally, the effects of invertebrates on aboveground plant biomass were determined under ambient and elevated nutrient conditions. At the more mesic sites, invertebrate herbivore abundances increased and their per capita rate of herbivory decreased with nutrient additions. In contrast, at the semi-arid site where plant biomass is low and plant nutrient concentrations are high, invertebrate herbivore abundances did not vary and per capita rates of herbivory increased with nutrient additions. No change in the effect of invertebrate herbivores on aboveground plant biomass was observed at any of the sites. In sum, nutrient additions induced shifts in both plant biomass and leaf nutrient content, which altered invertebrate abundances and feeding rate. However, due to the inverse relationship between changes in herbivore abundance and per capita rates of herbivory, nutrient additions did not alter the effect of invertebrates on aboveground biomass. Overall, we suggest that this inverse response of herbivore abundance and per capita feeding rate may buffer ecosystems against changes in invertebrate damage in response to fluctuations in nutrient levels.

AB  - Understanding the effects of vegetation on soil moisture is vital to the ecosystem restoration in water-restricted areas. For this study, the effects of introduced revegetation and natural revegetation on soil water (0-1.8 m) were investigated in the Chinese Loess Plateau, which was based on an in situ vegetation removal experiment and two years of soil moisture monitoring. The results indicated that under introduced revegetation, pasture grassland had lower soil moisture but higher temporal variations over the growing season. Compared with abandoned farmlands and native grasslands under natural revegetation, pasture grasslands revealed greater negative effects on deep soil moisture (1-1.8 m), which was difficult to recover following soil desiccation. In contrast, for abandoned farmlands and native grasslands, the surface soil moisture (0-0.4 m) was mainly impacted, which was easily replenished through rainfall events. These outcomes implied that natural revegetation, rather than introduced revegetation, should be the first choice in water-limited regions toward the rehabilitation of degraded ecosystems.

AB  - Physical processes that impact soil moisture are typically expressed as nonlinear functions, but most previous research on the estimation of soil moisture has relied on linear techniques. In the present work, two machine learning techniques, a spatial artificial neural network (SANN) and a mixture model (MM), that can infer nonlinear relationships are compared to multiple linear regression (MLR) for estimating soil moisture patterns using topographic attributes as predictor variables. The methods are applied to time-domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture data collected at three catchments with varying characteristics (Tarrawarra, Satellite Station and Cache la Poudre) under different wetness conditions. The methods' performances with respect to the number of predictor attributes, the quantity of training data and the attributes employed are compared using the Nash Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (NSCE) as the performance measure. The performances of the methods are dependent on the site studied, the average soil moisture and the quantity of training data provided. Although the methods often perform similarly, the best performing method overall is the SANN, which incorporates additional predictor variables more effectively than the other methods.

AB  - Satellite-based precipitation products have been widely used in a variety of fields. However, near real time products still contain substantial biases compared with the ground data. Recent studies showed that surface soil moisture can be utilized in improving rainfall estimation as it reflects recent precipitation. In this study, soil moisture data from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite and observation-based fitting are used to correct near real time satellite-based precipitation product Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) in mainland China. The particle filter is adopted to assimilate the SMAP soil moisture into a simple hydrological model, the antecedent precipitation index (API) model; three fitting methods-i.e., linear, nonlinear, and cumulative distribution function (CDF) fitting corrections-both separately and in combination with the SMAP soil moisture data, are then used to correct GPM. The results show that the soil moisture-based correction significantly reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute errors (BIAS) of the original GPM product in most areas of China. The median RMSE value for daily precipitation over China is decreased by approximately 18% from 5.25 mm/day for the GPM estimates to 4.32 mm/day for the soil moisture corrected estimates, and the median BIAS value is decreased by approximately 13% from 2.03 mm/day to 1.76 mm/day. The fitting correction method alone also improves GPM, although to a lesser extent. The best performance is found when the SMAP soil moisture assimilation is combined with the linear fitting of observed precipitation, with a median RMSE of 4.00 mm/day and a BIAS of 1.69 mm/day. Despite significant reductions to the biases of the satellite precipitation product, none of these methods is effective in improving the correlation between the satellite product and observational reference. Leaf area index and the frequency of the SMAP overpasses are among the potential factors influencing the correction effect. This study highlights that combining soil moisture and historical precipitation information can effectively improve satellite-based precipitation products in near real time.

AB  - Recent technological advances have made possible automated irrigation scheduling using decision-support tools. These tools help farmers to make better decisions in the management of their irrigation system, thus increasing yields while preserving water resources. The aim of this study is to evaluate in a commercial plot an automated irrigation system combined with remote-sensing techniques and soil mapping that allows the establishment of regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategies. The study was carried out over 3 years (2015-2017) in a commercial hedgerow olive orchard of the variety 'Arbequina' located in Alvarado (Extremadura, Spain). An apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) map and a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map were generated to characterize the spatial variability of the plot and classify the zones in homogeneous areas. Then, reference points were selected to monitor the different irrigation sectors. In 2015, the plot was irrigated according to the farmer's technical criteria throughout the plot. In 2016 and 2017, two different areas of the plot were irrigated applying an RDI strategy, one under expert supervision and the other automatically. The results show that in a heterogeneous plot the use of new technologies can be useful to establish the ideal location for an automatic irrigation system. Furthermore, automatic irrigation scheduling made it possible to establish an RDI strategy recommended by an expert, resulting in the homogenization of production throughout the plot without the need for human intervention.

AB  - The understanding of land surface-atmosphere energy exchange is extremely important for predicting climate change and weather impacts, particularly the influence of soil moisture content (SMC) on hydrometeorological and ecological processes, which are also linked to human activities. Unfortunately, traditional measurement methods are expensive and cumbersome over large areas, whereas measurements from satellite active and passive microwave sensors have shown advantages for SMC monitoring. Since the launch of the first passive microwave satellite in 1978, more and more progresses have been made in monitoring SMC from satellites, e.g., the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions in the last decade. Recently, new methods using signals of opportunity have been emerging, highlighting the Global Navigation Satellite Systems-Reflectometry (GNSS-R), which has wide applications in Earth's surface remote sensing due to its numerous advantages (e.g., revisiting time, global coverage, low cost, all-weather measurements, and near real-time) when compared to the conventional observations. In this paper, a detailed review on the current SMC measurement techniques, retrieval approaches, products, and applications is presented, particularly the new and promising GNSS-R technique. Recent advances, future prospects and challenges are given and discussed.

AB  - Different methods for the soil water content measurement (neutron probe, capacitance sensors, etc.) can provide actual data for the state of soil moisture (Kordik and Lichner, 1996). Based on this data different levels of sufficient water can be described (field capacity, availability, and wilting point). In order to compare data of various soil moisture measurement instruments it is mandatory to evaluate the accuracy of each method. In practice neutron probe is applied as the most accurate instrument, however due to its radiation work safety rules question the long-term applicability of such instruments. This article reports the comparison of three methods: neutron probe, capacity method and a so-called I-sensor. Since soil moisture measurement methods differ on the Hungarian and Slovakian side of the Danube, data comparison can lead to disagreements on soil moisture level. For the above-mentioned reason introduction of a new measurement method could be justified.

AB  - Soil moisture content was measured by TDR sensors Aqua-Tel-TDR (Automata, Inc., today McCrometer CONNECT) in a loamy Chernozem on carbonate-rich loess substrate. The sensors, wrapped in slurry made of local soil and water, were installed horizontally into pre-made holes. The bias caused by imperfectly filled gaps between the wall of the hole and the sensor surface was reduced by field calibration. The same gaps made it possible to detect the preferential flow in soil macropores, due to which the reflectometric readings were perceivably higher than analogous readings before percolation events and sometimes higher than the native soil porosity. One typical event is presented. It is envisaged that sensors of this type can be used for semi-quantitative estimation of the preferential flux density, e.g. with the help of dual or multiple porous medium models or the momentum dissipation theory.

AB  - The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), a publicly accessible spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) data, provides a new alternative opportunity for large-scale soil moisture (SM) retrieval, but with interference from complex environmental conditions (i.e., vegetation cover and ground roughness). This study aims to develop a high-accuracy model for CYGNSS SM retrieval. The normalized surface reflectivity calculated by CYGNSS is fused with variables that are highly related to the SM obtained from optical/microwave remote sensing to solve the problem of the influence of complicated environmental conditions. The Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) model aided by land-type data is then used to construct a multi-variables SM retrieval model with six different land types of multiple models. The methodology is tested in southeastern China, and the results correlate very well with the existing satellite remote sensing products and in situ SM data (R = 0.765, ubRMSE = 0.054 m3m-3 vs. SMAP; R = 0.653, ubRMSE = 0.057 m3 m-3 vs. ERA5 SM; R = 0.691, ubRMSE = 0.057 m3m-3 vs. in situ SM). This study makes contributions from two aspects: (1) improves the accuracy of the CYGNSS retrieval of SM based on fusion with other auxiliary data; (2) constructs the SM retrieval model with multi-layer multiple models, which is suitable for different land properties.

AB  - Different combinations of organic mulch were applied in smallholder coffee farming systems to assess their effects on soil nutrient contents and coffee yield at three sites in different agro-ecological zones in Rwanda. Mulching systems consisted of Cymbopogon spp. (T1), Panicum spp. (T2), Cymbopogon spp. and Panicum spp. (T3), Eucalyptus spp. and Cymbopogon spp. (T4), mixed residues (T5) and un-mulched coffee used as control (T6). Mulch had significant and specific effects at each site (p < 0.001). T3 reduced soil pH value and exchangeable acidity at Kibirizi, while at Karongi and Ruli, these effects were observed with T4 and T5. T4 and T5 significantly increased the content of soil carbon (C), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg). The amount of nutrients released was regulated by the amount and type of mulch applied, the agro-ecological conditions and the soil properties at each site. The increased soil nutrient levels led to improved soil fertility conditions and increased coffee yields. The coffee yields were significantly increased with T1 at Karongi (p < 0.05) by up to 1.9 t ha(-1). T2 and T3 had significantly higher yields at Kibirizi. Yields at Kibirizi were 48% lower compared to yields at Karongi; at this site, T1, T2, T3, T4 and T5 increased yields by 57%, 26%, 31%, 20% and 28%, respectively, when compared to the no mulching treatment (T6). However, coffee yields over 1.9 t ha(-1) can only be obtained with additional applications of inorganic fertilizer at different rates depending on the agro-ecological zone and soil type.

AB  - Active and passive microwave remote sensing techniques provide an effective way to observe soil moisture contents. We validated Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) sensor products using estimations from nine different stations located in the Korean peninsula, in northeast Asia from May 1 to September 30, 2010. The results of the surface soil moisture (SSM) products showed a reasonable agreement with the average correlation coefficient (R) values of 039, 0.42, and 0.53 for the National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC), Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam - National Aeronautics and Space Administration (VUA-NASA) AMSR-E, and ASCAT SSM datasets, respectively. The root zone soil moisture (RZSM) products, derived using the NSIDC soil water index (SWI), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) AMSR-E, and the ASCAT SWI datasets showed relatively high R values of 0.47, 0.72, and 0.75, respectively, with in situ soil moisture at a depth of 20 cm. In particular, AMSR-E USDA RZSM data show best agreements with in-situ data at 20 cm, among the four depths (10, 20, 30, and 50 cm). In this study, the ASCAT SSM and SWI were rescaled based on the porosity and the effective saturation according to soil texture. Renormalized soil moisture products using three renormalization methods: the linear regression correction (REG), average-standard deviation (mu - sigma), and cumulative distribution function (CDF) provided an improvement in biases and RMSEs, with SSM (SWI) RMSEs of 0.04 (0.02), 0.05 (0.03), and 0.05 (0.03) m(3)/m(3) for REG mu - sigma, and CDF matching, respectively. A Taylor diagram was used to assess the accuracy of four satellite soil moisture products with in situ data on a plot. Based on these results, ASCAT soil moisture products were potentially proven to be more appropriate than AMSR-E products in northeast Asia. Remotely sensed soil moisture datasets from passive (AMSR-E) and active (ASCAT) sensors are beneficial to operational hydrological investigations and water management activities.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable of land surface-atmosphere interactions. Data-driven methods have been used to predict SM, but the predictability of SM has not been well evaluated. This study investigated what variables and methods can be used to better predict SM for leading times of 7 days or longer with a global coverage of FLUXNET site data for the first time. Three machine-learning models, that is, Bayesian linear regression, random forest, and gradient boosting regression tree, are used for the prediction. Variables including atmospheric forcing, surface soil temperature, time variables (year, day of year, and hour), the Fourier transformation of time variables, and lagged SM (7- to 14-day lagged) were sequentially added into models. A framework with five experiments is designed for factorial exploration of SM predictability. A stepwise method was used to build the best models for each site. The performance of regression models became better when adding more explaining variables in most cases. The results showed that from 50 to 95% of variation of the best models can be explained. The important explaining variables are lagged surface SM, followed by day of year, year, soil temperature, and atmospheric forcing. The predictability of SM depends highly on SM memory characteristics and the persistence of seasonality. The effect of SM memory characteristics on SM prediction as an initial condition question has been widely discussed in this paper. Our results also provide an insight that mechanisms of seasonality effects on SM should be also paid more attention to.

AB  - Changes in the quantity and/or quality of soil labile organic matter between and after different types of cultivation system could play a dominant role in soil nitrogen (N) mineralization. The quantity and quality of particulate organic matter (POM) and potentially mineralizable-N (PMN) contents were measured in soils from 16 paired rice-rapeseed (RR)/cotton-rapeseed (CR) rotations sites in Hubei province, central China. Then four paired soils encompassing low (10th percentile), intermediate (25th and 75th percentiles), and high (90th percentile) levels of soil PMN were selected to further study the effects of POM on soil N mineralization by quantifying the net N mineralization in original soils and soils from which POM was removed. Both soil POM carbon (POM-C) and N (POM-N) contents were 45.8% and 55.8% higher under the RR rotation compared to the CR rotation, respectively. The PMN contents were highly correlated with the POM contents. The PMN and microbial biomass N (MBN) contents concurrently and significantly decreased when POM was removed. The reduction rate of PMN was positively correlated with changes in MBN after the removal of POM. The reduction rates of PMN and MBN after POM removal are lower under RR rotations (38.0% and 16.3%, respectively) than CR rotations (45.6% and 19.5%, respectively). Furthermore, infrared spectroscopy indicated that compounds with low-bioavailability accumulated (e.g., aromatic recalcitrant materials) in the soil POM fraction under the RR rotation but not under the CR rotation. The results of the present study demonstrated that POM plays a vital role in soil N mineralization under different rotation systems. The discrepancy between POM content and composition resulting from different crop rotation systems caused differences in N mineralization in soils.

AB  - Drought and population growth, especially in the western United States, are propelling a need for more efficient irrigation. Smart irrigation controllers, which interface with soil moisture, evapotranspiration (ET), or weather sensors, have been promoted as a demand-side management tool for this purpose. This paper reviews the body of research on residential smart irrigation controllers and their effectiveness. We find that smart irrigation controllers consistently reduce water demand by 15% among general users and more than 40% among indulgent users. Gaps in research include studies addressing peak demand reduction, centralized communication, data verifiability, and human factors of landscape management. Future work may develop techniques for coordinating networks of smart irrigation controllers to enable greater shifting and shaving of discretionary irrigation demands, similar to what is already happening in the electric grid, thereby creating an integrated water distribution system (IWDS). An IWDS may utilize smart irrigation controllers as direct load control devices at customer end points and interface with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems at a central location to create more effective demand-side management (DSM) strategies for water conservation.
   Weather-based irrigation controllers (WBICs) have become the prevalent smart controllers used for residential irrigation scheduling. They are easy to install, have smartphone control, are easy to program, utilize local real-time weather data, prevent operating the irrigation system during rain or other adverse weather events, adjust watering schedules and duration seasonally, conserve water, and reduce water billing costs. In addition to the ease of use and benefits at the residential user level, smart irrigation controllers have the potential to provide the water utility with controls to buffer or shift peak irrigation demands. This buffering and shifting of peak demands have the potential to lower energy costs, decrease the carbon footprint, and delay costly infrastructure upgrades. With technological advancements and the proliferation of smart controllers, the future for water utilities will become more similar to the electrical grid industry. The smart controllers and technology will enable the development of the IWDS. The IWDS will allow the water utility to utilize data from AMI meters, SCADA systems, smart irrigation controllers, artificial intelligence, and other smart technology to operate more effectively and efficiently.

AB  - Robusta coffee (Coffea canephora Pierre ex Froehner) is well suited to the humid tropical climate of the Amazon basin. It is often produced under contrasting conditions of low-input agroforestry systems and intensively managed monocultures that differ in N constraints on productivity. We evaluated indicators of soil N cycling and coffee plant N sufficiency using a full factorial of two input managements (organic vs. conventional) and the absence or presence of the interplanted leguminous tree (LT) Erythrina spp. in a replicated robusta coffee field trial in the Ecuadorian Amazon. Activities of soil protease, three aminopeptidases, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, cellobiohydrolase, and beta-glucosidase were evaluated in tandem with soil NH4-N and NO3-N, potentially mineralizable N (PMN), and permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), as well as coffee leaf N, leaf N/P ratio (N/P), and yield. The LT decreased soil enzyme activities, PMN, and extractable NH4-N, as well as leaf N and leaf N/P. Enzyme activities and NH4-N were greater under organic input, but conventional input resulted in greater PMN, leaf N, leaf N/P, and yield. Permanganate oxidizable C and NO3-N were similar across input and interplanting but were more variable in the presence of LT relative to its absence. Lower soil enzymatic activities, labile N pools, and leaf N in coffee systems with Erythrina spp. suggest that, although a common smallholder practice in this region, interplanting this leguminous perennial has marginal impacts on soil N cycling and may not necessarily improve N supply for robusta coffee.

AB  - This review describes the theory and basic principles of spectral reflectance measurements including the advantages and disadvantages of different sensing platforms either space, aerial or ground based. The use of spectral reflectance techniques for aiding decisions relating to crop establishment, weed control, crop protection and crop nutrition are discussed, indicating the uses, limitations, areas requiring further work and future potential as a commercial tool for precision agriculture.
   It is concluded that spectral reflectance techniques are unlikely to be used for measuring soil properties as other technologies are better suited to this application. Spectral reflectance techniques can be used to detect weeds against a soil background but with current approaches cannot reliably identify weeds at sufficiently low populations (plants m(-2)) in a growing crop to control commercial herbicide applications. Spectral reflectance techniques also provide useful information about the crop canopy that can be used as a component in determining the fungicide, growth regulator and nitrogen inputs to a cereal crop.

AB  - Various studies have demonstrated the potential of thermal infrared brightness temperature (TIR T(B)) for monitoring surface exchanges of water and energy. This study focuses on the contribution of TIR T(B) data for Land Surface Model (LSM) calibration. A numerical representation of the Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere (SVA) transfers (SVAT model), named SEtHyS, was used. A calibration methodology of the model based uniquely on the optimisation of TIR T(B) diurnal cycle features has been developed and applied, in an assimilation context, to the full vegetation period of a wheat crop. The results illustrate the advantages of such a methodology for the monitoring of environmental conditions simulated with the SVAT model, such as the root zone soil moisture. The impact of observation and simulation errors on TIR T(B) was analysed and quantified in controlled numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the advantages of using relative temperature characteristics, instead of temperature values themselves, to minimise the impact of noise.

AB  - There is growing interest in multifunctional sensors that expand sensing capabilities, especially for environmental measurement needs. This paper aims to develop a multifunctional penta-needle thermo-dielectric sensor (MPTDS) by coupling an electromagnetic (EM) sensor for determining water content with a penta-needle heat pulse probe (PHPP) for determining thermal properties. The thermal properties were inverse fit to the measured temperature rise at four surrounding thermistor needles from an 8-s heat pulse on a central heater needle. The dielectric permittivity was obtained from an impedance measurement made on the heater needle and two adjacent thermistor needles, leading to water content estimates. To determine water content and thermal properties for porous media, a two-step permittivity calibration and an in-situ effective needle spacing calibration were also made. The prototype MPTDS was evaluated in fine quartz sand across a range of water contents from dry to saturated to determine dielectric permittivity, thermal conductivity, and thermal diffusivity, followed by the accurate calculation of water content and soil heat capacity. The limited comparison here demonstrates substantially improved substrate water content determination accuracy from the EM sensor (RSME = 0.012 cm(3)/cm(3)) when compared with heat-pulse estimates (RSME = 0.042 cm(3)/cm(3)).

AB  - Permittivity monitoring for quality control in fluid-related industrial applications requires difficult procedures and the process control frequently limits the use of traditional sensing technologies. In this paper is reported a combined approach, based on time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain analysis, in order to appropriately improve the measurement of the frequency-dependent dielectric characteristics over a wide range of fluid materials, even when lossy liquids are involved. For this purpose, we have developed a robust algorithm for the time-to-frequency-domain dielectric characterization that suitably compensates the error contribution caused by several effects such as signal dissipation, multiple reflections, impedance mismatching, time-domain truncation and data fitting procedure. In order to assess the combined approach in the time and frequency domain, experimental measurements have been made with both a TDR and vector network analyser (VNA), using the same probe system. Results obtained through the use of such an algorithm on TDR data have been compared with those directly measured in the frequency domain by the VNA, and good agreement has been observed. Substantial improvements are attained in accuracy, high sensitivity and flexibility of the detection method and, most importantly, in the possibility of using low-cost instrumentation directly operating in the time domain.

AB  - Novel, low-cost, screen-printed (thick-film) conductivity sensors have been incorporated into laboratory-based soil columns together with water-content sensors, so that changes in the soil structure could be monitored through correlation of changes in soil conductivity and water content during cyclic wetting and drying of the soil. Significant differences were found in the relationship between the electrical conductivity and water content (CWC) characteristics for the different soil types tested. It was also found that cyclic wetting and draining of the soils, such as would occur due to natural climate effects, produces changes in the CWC characteristics that are indicative of soil structural change.

AB  - Quantification of root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus thornei and P. neglectus) was evaluated using three different methods; the Whitehead tray method, the mister method and the commercially available quantitative DNA assay. These methods were compared to determine the effect of soil water content, sampling method and soil storage conditions on estimates of pre-sowing densities of nematodes. The Whitehead tray method, which is reliant on extraction of live nematodes, recovered fewer nematodes from dry soil than from moist soil and fewer from soil dried before storage. By contrast, the DNA assay was not influenced by soil water content at the time of sampling or drying of the soil after sampling.

AB  - The manufacture of wind turbine blades generally uses balsa wood as the base materials, and it is crucial to explore new regions for cultivating balsa trees to achieve carbon neutrality in the future. Xishuangbanna may be China's only area with a tropical climate suitable for the large-scale planting of balsa trees. The present study investigated the key soil elements influencing the growth of balsa plantations and the effects of different cultivation practices on soil environments and economic benefits in Xishuangbanna, China. We found that the height of balsa stems after growing 4 years reached 5.8 m; the increment of diameter at breast height (DBH) reached 27.7 cm and volume of balsa stems reached 196.0 m3 ha-1 in Xishuangbanna of China. It is of the utmost importance to improve the contents of soil exchangeable magnesium (Mg) and available phosphorus (P) for the growth of balsa trees, and exchangeable aluminium (Al) inhibited the growth of balsa trees. The practice of plastic film mulching not only improved soil moisture in the 40-100-cm soil layer in the dry season and in the 0-60-cm soil layer in the rainy season but also enhanced soil nitrate nitrogen when compared with no plastic-mulching practice in balsa plantations. The comprehensive economic benefits of balsa/coriander/ginger/taro plantations were significantly improved by implementing plastic film mulching, as compared to balsa plantations. We conclude that balsa tree can be cultivated in Xishuangbanna, China, and its successful cultivation provides opportunities for China's wind power development.

AB  - The impacts of soil moisture (SM) on heavy rainfall and the development of Mesoscale Convection Systems (MCSs) are investigated through 24-h numerical simulations of two heavy rainfall events that occurred respectively on 28 March 2009 (Case 1) and 6 May 2010 (Case 2) over southern China. The numerical simulations were carried out with WRF and its coupled Noah LSM (Land Surface Model). First, comparative experiments were driven by two different SM data sources from NCEP-FNL and NASA-GLDAS. Secondary, with the run driven by NASA-GLDAS data as a control one, a series of sensitivity tests with different degree of (20%, 60%) increase or decrease in the initial SM were performed to examine the impact of SM on the simulations. Comparative experiment results show that the 24-h simulated cumulative rainfall distributions are not substantially affected by the application of the two different SM data, while the precipitation intensity is changed to some extent. Forecast skill scores show that simulation with NASA-GLDAS SM data can lead to some improvement, especially in the heavy rain (. 50 mm) forecast, where there is up to 5% increase in the TS score. Sensitivity test analysis found that a predominantly positive feedback of SM on precipitation existed in these two heavy rain events but not with completely the same features. Organization of the heavy rainfall-producing MCS seems to have an impact on the feedback process between SM and precipitation. For Case 1, the MCS was poorly organized and occurred locally in late afternoon, and the increase of SM only caused a slight enhancement of precipitation. Drier soil was found to result in an apparent decrease of rainfall intensity, indicating that precipitation is more sensitive to SM reduction. For Case 2, as the heavy rain was caused by a well-organized MCS with sustained precipitation, the rainfall is more sensitive to SM increase, which brings more rainfall. Additionally, distinctive feedback effects were identified from different stages and different organization of MCS, with strong feedback between SM and precipitation mainly appearing in the early stages of the poorly organized MCS and during the late period of the well-organized MCS.

AB  - Field experiment with 6 soil tillage systems was set up on Stagnosol in Central Croatia in 1994. Tillage systems differed in tools that were used, depth and direction of tillage. 13 years after experiment establishment, oil seed rape was cover crop (season 2006/07). In 2007 soil resistance, bulk density and soil water content data were collected in order to detect effects of different soil tillage systems on soil compaction. Data were obtained at 4 depths in different time intervals during vegetation period. Statistical data evaluation showed significant differences in soil resistance between all tillage systems at all depths. Soil resistance varied at depth 0-10 cm from 0.46 to 2.82 MPa, at depth 10-20 cm from 0.85 to 3.85 MPa, at depth 20-30 cm from 1.02 to 5.01 and at depth 30-40 cm from 1.21 to 5.31 MPa. Bulk density values at all depths of all tillage systems varied from 1.46 to 1.73 g cm(-3). Soil water content during research period varied from 27 to 43%. It can be concluded that climate conditions differently affected soil resistance at different tillage practice.

AB  - This study investigates how the enhanced loading of microphysically and radiatively active aerosol particles impacts tropical sea breeze convective systems and whether these impacts are modulated by the many environments that support these cloud systems. Comparisons of two 130-member pristine and polluted ensembles demonstrate that aerosol direct effects reduce the surface incoming shortwave radiation and the surface outgoing longwave radiation. Changes in the ensemble median values of the surface latent heat flux, the mixed layer depth, the mixed layer convective available potential energy, the maximum inland sea breeze extent, and the sea breeze frontal lift suggest that enhanced aerosol loading generally creates a less favorable environment for sea breeze convective systems. However, the sign and magnitude of these aerosol-induced changes are occasionally modulated by the surface, wind, and low-level thermodynamic conditions. As reduced surface fluxes and instability inhibit the convective boundary layer development, updraft velocities of the daytime cumulus convection developing ahead of the sea breeze front are robustly reduced in polluted environments across the environments tested. Statistical emulators and variance-based sensitivity analyses reveal that the soil saturation fraction is the most important environmental factor contributing to the updraft velocity variance of this daytime cumulus convection, but that it becomes a less important contributor with enhanced aerosol loading. It is also demonstrated that increased aerosol loading generally results in a weakening of the sea-breeze-initiated convection. This suppression is particularly robust when the sea-breeze-initiated convection is shallower and, hence, restricted to warm rain processes. While the less favorable convective environment arising from aerosol direct effects also restricts the development of sea-breeze-initiated deep convection in some cases, the response does appear to be environmentally modulated, with some cases producing stronger convective updrafts in more polluted environments. Sea breeze precipitation is ubiquitously suppressed with enhanced aerosol loading across all of the environments tested; however, the magnitude of this suppression remains a function of the initial environment. Altogether, our results highlight the importance of evaluating both direct and indirect aerosol effects on convective systems under the wide range of convective environments.

AB  - Soil conservation systems can achieve agricultural sustainability together with the integration and diversification of management activities, exploring the synergism of the system. The objective of this work was to evaluate in a temporal manner the physical attributes of the soil, under a crop-livestock-forest integration system, to verify possible contributions physical quality of the soil and system sustainability itself. The soil under study is a Typical Ultisol. The randomized block design was distributed in four respective treatments: crop-livestock integration, without the tree component (CLI), agrosilvipastoral system, with one eucalyptus (Eucalyptus ssp.) line of shading (AS1L), agrosilvipastoral system, with three eucalyptus lines of shading (AS3L), and exclusive culture of eucalyptus. The samples were collected from 2014 to 2018, in the 0-0.05, 0.05-0.1, and 0.1-0.2 m layers, to the water infiltration evaluations in soil, resistance to penetration, content of soil humidity. The results revealed that the systems that use integration improve or maintain physical quality of the soil, without compacting or negatively influencing water infiltration, highlighting the treatments CLI, AS1L e AS3L through time, which promotes its sustainability.

AB  - Sensor-based feedback control irrigation systems have been increasingly explored for greenhouse applications. However, the relationships between microclimate variation, plant water usage, and growth are not well understood. A series of trials were conducted to investigate the microclimate variations in different greenhouses and whether a soil moisture sensor-based system can be used in monitoring and controlling irrigation in greenhouse crop productions. Ocimum basilicum 'Genovese Gigante' basil and Campanula portenschlagiana 'Get Mee' bellflowers were monitored using soil moisture sensors for an entire crop cycle at two commercial greenhouses. Significant variations in greenhouse microclimates were observed within the two commercial greenhouses and within an older research greenhouse. Evaporation rates were measured and used as an integrated indicator of greenhouse microclimate conditions. Evaporation rates varied within all three greenhouses and were almost double the lowest rates within one of the greenhouses, suggesting microclimates within a range of greenhouses. Although these microclimate variations caused large variations in the growing substrate water contents of containers within the greenhouses, the growth and quality of the plants were unaffected. For example, no significant correlations were observed between the growth of bellflower plants and the average volumetric water content (VWC), minimum VWC, or maximum VWC of the growing substrate. The change in VWC at each irrigation (DVWC), however, was positively correlated with the fresh weight, dry weight, and growth index (GI) of the bellflowers. For basil, no significant correlations were observed between plant growth and DVWC. This suggests that sensor-based feedback irrigation systems can be used for greenhouse crop production when considerations are given to factors such as the magnitude of microclimate variation, crop species and its sensitivity to water stress, and growing substrate.

AB  - Despite their important role in soil nutrient cycling, soil bacterial communities' response to land management practices and soil hydrologic fluctuations are not sufficiently studied. The effects of land use and soil moisture regime on soil bacterial community structure and diversity in the Missouri River Floodplain have been investigated in this study. Three land use systems represented riparian forest (RF), pecan (Carya illinoinensis) orchard/ hay agroforestry system (AF), and row crop corn [Zea mays L.]/soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] agriculture system (AG). Microbial diversity indices and the abundance of selected bacterial phyla were investigated in bulk soil samples by performing 16 s rRNA amplicon sequencing. Soil samples were collected from three selected land use systems in September 2020 and May 2021. To simulate the hydrological dynamics of the riparian systems, intact soil cores were subjected to two different soil moisture regimes: saturated (FD) and alternately saturated and field capacity (FL) for 8 weeks of incubation. A control sample was maintained at field capacity for the entire duration of the experiment. Soil physicochemical properties substantially differed among land use. Soil organic matter (OM%) was significantly greater in AF and RF than in AG. Proteobacteria, Actinobacteriota, and Acid-obacteriota were found to be the most dominant bacterial phyla across all samples. The bacterial richness and Shannon indices were not considerably different among land use systems. Soil FD conditions considerably increased the abundance of Actinobacteriota in AF soils. The abundance of these phyla was strikingly higher in AF with the greatest organic matter relative to AG and RF under all three water regimes. Further work may be needed to assess the effects of hydrological events on floodplain soils' microbial community indices.

AB  - Sustainable practices are key factors in the advancement of environmental protection in agroecosystems, especially if these systems are situated in degraded and vulnerable areas, such as semiarid regions. One sustainable practice developed primarily in tropical farms is the use of a multi-cropping system. This system was applied using participatory approaches by family farmers from a semiarid region of Brazil and evaluated based on the perception and monitoring of the farmers, particularly the soil moisture enhancement in their productive areas. Thus, this study aimed to evaluate the impact of management practices on soil moisture in multi-cropping areas using an alternative method, based on the standard method, developed and applied by farmers in the field. In addition, the soil moisture alterations in multi-cropping systems were evaluated considering the water retention curve and the soil moisture monitoring in situ. We concluded that conservative practices in multi-cropping systems do contribute to water conservation. Furthermore, the establishment of a methodology to evaluate multi-cropping systems directly in the field by farmers is an important strategy to show to the farmers' results that confirm the importance of the practices developed by them to maintain good production and general benefits to the environment.

AB  - - The objective of this study was to monitor the temporal variation in penetration resistance (PR) after soil saturation under different management systems in three areas of the Cerrado biome: two in no -till systems (NT with 3 and 10 years of implementation) and one of crop -livestock integration (CL with 9 years of implementation) with soybean/forage succession. Four transects were delimited in each area. The delimited area was saturated and the PR measurements were performed daily for 11 days at 10 transect points, up to 0.40 m of depth. Soil moisture was determined with PR measurements, soil hydraulic conductivity, and organic carbon. PR values were more significant in the 0.10 - 0.20 m layer than in the 0.0 - 0.10 and 0.20 - 0.40 m layers. The NT -3 area showed a lower PR value (1.65 MPa) than the area under NT -10 and CL -9, with 2.48 and 2.69 MPa, respectively. Thus, critical soil moisture values, that is, soil moisture values most susceptible to soil compaction were determined. Thus, in the NT -3 area, the critical moisture was 0.20 kg kg -1 , in the NT -10, ranged from 0.19 - 0.20 kg kg -1 , and in the CL -9, between 0.23 and 0.20 kg kg -1 . Monitoring soil moisture can prevent management operations from restricting root growth.

AB  - The potential use of drip irrigation to reduce water use without yield penalty in aerobic rice cultivation has not been fully explored in the tropics due to high investment costs. One major way to lowering this cost is by optimizing the lateral spacing to serve more rows of rice plants per dripline. This study evaluates the effects of lateral dripline spacing on the grain yield, water productivity, and the economic return in aerobic rice production. Field experiments were conducted for the period of two years (2020-2021) using three lateral dripline spacings (40-cm, 60-cm, and 80-cm) as treatments and surface flooding as the control. Grain yields, water use, water productivity, and economic benefits were evaluated. The drip-irrigated aerobic rice did not show significant differences with surface flooding except for a lower yield at 80-cm in 2021 dry season due to its low percent filled grains. Among treatments, the 60-cm lateral spacing consistently obtained the highest irrigation water productivity by up to 1.03 kg m(-3) and 42% irrigation water savings relative to surface flooding. Increasing the spacing of the lateral dripline decreased the material costs (80 < 60 < 40 cm) by 10-36%. The 60-cm spacing produced the highest average net income by 41-75% among drip treatments and had comparative economic returns compared with surface flooding. The net present value and the benefit-cost ratio indicate that it is economically viable to invest in drip irrigation using a 60-cm lateral spacing. Thus, this study suggests that when there is insufficient water to grow surface flooding aerobic rice, drip irrigation using 60-cm lateral spacing is the best option for reducing irrigation water use and increasing water productivity; while having comparative yield and economic return as surface flooding method of aerobic rice cultivation.

AB  - In areas with extensive soil erosion, there is a need to identify the sources supplying sediment to rivers in order to improve our understanding of erosion processes and to guide the implementation of effective soil management measures. Geochemical elements are often used as tracers in sediment fingerprinting studies. Among them, P has often been used as it may specifically trace sediment originating from cropland. Although P-fractions can provide more detailed information than the total P content, their potential to distinguish between different potential sources of sediments has rarely been tested. The objective of the current research was to evaluate the contribution of sediment sources in a rural catchment (Arvorezinha, 1.23 km(2)) of Southern Brazil, using different sets of tracers (i.e. P-fractions only, geochemical tracers only, and a combination of both tracers). Three potential sediment source types were identified in the catchment: (i) cropland, (ii) unpaved roads and (iii) stream channel banks. Thirty-one suspended sediment samples were collected in the river draining this catchment during 9 significant floods between 2009 and 2011. Estimates of P-fractions were obtained by Hedley fractionation using anion exchange resin membrane (P-resin); 0.5 mol L-1 NaHCO3 (pH 8.5) (P-bic); 0.1 mol L-1 NaOH (P-NaOH0.1), 1.0 mol L-1 HCl (P-HCl); 0.5 mol L-1 NaOH (P-NaOH0.5); and residual P (P-residual). Total organic (P-org) and inorganic P (P-inorg)were obtained by the ignition method. The concentrations of P-HCl, P-NaOH0.5 and P-inorg in suspended sediments were higher than those found in the sources. Accordingly, these fractions were considered not to be conservative and were excluded from further analysis. With the exception of P-residual, all P-fractions passed the Kruskal-Wallis H-test and were considered as potential tracers of sediment sources. When the P-fractions were combined with geochemical tracers, the discrimination power was much higher than when using geochemical tracers only. The Mahalanobis distance was 9% higher than that observed in the geochemical approach. The calculated contribution of sediment sources using the three approaches was very similar, and cropland was the dominant source of sediment, with calculated contributions of 56 +/- 19, 46 +/- 16 and 48 +/- 16% for those approaches based on geochemical elements, P-fractions, and geochemical + P-fractions, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of some P-fractions to trace potential sediment sources in rural catchments, as they have a high discriminant power while remaining conservative during sediment transport in the catchment.

AB  - Using Economic Irrigation Water Productivity (EIWP) as an indicator for on-farm irrigation decision-making is of utmost importance in addressing the challenges posed by poor policies in managing agricultural water use, particularly in water-scarce basins. Various modeling systems are available for quantifying crop actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and biomass needed for measuring the economic output obtained from each unit of irrigation water utilized. The difference in ET(a )and biomass estimates between the modeling systems could translate into a difference in EIWP outcomes, which influences the basin-wide irrigation water management. In this paper we examine the influence of selecting different ET(a )and biomass models, particularly the hybrid single-source energy balance HSEB, the Global Field-Scale Crop Yield and ET Mapper in Google Earth Engine GYMEE, and FAO's WaPOR V2, on evaluating EIWP on a basin-wide level. The method includes combining remote sensing and economic data to compare variability in ETa, biomass, and EIWP values derived from HSEB, GYMEE, and WaPOR. The approach is demonstrated with field survey data from the upper hydrologic unit of Lebanon's largest catchment, the Litani River Basin, in its three productive districts Baalbak, Zahleh, and West Bekaa for the year 2021. Field-scale mean monthly ET(a )and biomass estimates for all crops, obtained from both models, are very comparable. On a district level, the results reveal a reasonable model agreement for the four crops in the estimation of ET(a )with moderate to strong correlation (0.75 < r < 0.95). WaPOR consistently produces slightly higher mean ET(a )values for potato, wheat, and table grapes when compared to HSEB. Both models reasonably agree when estimating biomass for the four crops with high correlation (r > 0.9). Contrary to the ETa results, the GYMEE model consistently estimates slightly higher mean biomass values for all crops compared to WaPOR. The EIWP values produced by both models consistently indicate that potato holds the highest EIWP across all districts, followed by onion, table grapes, and wheat. The mean district HSEB-GYMEE model derived EIWPs are slightly higher than those derived from the WaPOR model for most crops. For EIWP obtained from HSEB-GYMEE, mean EIWP for potato is 12 times higher than that of wheat. As for that obtained from WaPOR, mean EIWP for potato is 10 times higher than that of wheat. The paper establishes a basis for future research on the application of remote sensing models in addressing water-stressed and socioeconomically challenged basins, with the potential to inform strategic irrigation management decisions based on model selection.

AB  - The Richards' equation is widely used in the modeling soil water dynamics driven by the capillary and gravitational forces in the vadose zone. Its state and parameter estimation based on field soil moisture measurements is important and challenging for field applications of the Richards' equation. In this work, we consider simultaneous state and parameter estimation of systems described by the three dimensional Richards' equation with multiple types of soil. Based on a study on the interaction between subsystems, we propose to use decentralized estimation schemes to reduce the complexity of the estimation problem. Guidelines for subsystem decomposition are discussed and a decentralized estimation scheme developed in the framework of moving horizon state estimation is proposed. Extensive simulation results are presented to show the performance of the proposed decentralized approach.

AB  - AimsOur objective was to evaluate if the relationship between quick indices of mineralizable N and soil N mineralization potential (N-o) is affected by long-term fertilization with inorganic fertilizers (IF) and/or poultry litter (PL).MethodsSamples from four long-term research sites that were fertilized with IF, IF+PL, or PL (>10years) were aerobically incubated for 24 weeks to determine N-o. Soil N-o was then related to the results from the Illinois soil test analysis (ISNT), extractions with hot KCl, NaOH, or phosphate-borate (PB), and an anaerobic incubation (N-an).ResultsAll evaluated chemical methods were correlated with N-o (R-2>0.59). However, the models to describe the association between the chemical methods and N-o differed depending on the fertilizer treatment, due to the inability of chemical indices to estimate the N-o increase observed in some PL-amended soils. In contrast, the relationship between N-an and N-o was not affected by fertilization strategy.ConclusionsChemical indices can lead to the underestimation of soil N mineralization potential in PL-treated soils when the indices are calibrated in IF-amended soils, whereas the biological method N-an predicted N-o independently from the field's fertilization history.

AB  - An entropy-based approach has been developed for estimation of natural recharge in Kodaganar River basin, Tamil Nadu, southern India. Wells were located in a weathered aquifer which exhibits spatial variability in natural recharge. To determine the fractional amount of rainfall (called natural recharge), marginal entropy and transinformation of rainfall and depth to the water table at selected wells were calculated. Then a ratio of transinformation to marginal entropy of rainfall was used as a measure for assessing natural recharge. The mean natural recharge values at 28 wells distributed over the study area were computed. The average recharge rate was about 62.95 mm/yr or 14.48% of local average seasonal rainfall. The calculated annual input of rainfall to groundwater reserves was about 0.11 x 10(9) m(3)/yr.

AB  - Intensively practices rice-wheat (R-W) cropping system (RWCS) in South-Asia is suffering from many sustainability issues such as micronutrient deficiencies, labour scarcity, production cost, declining land, declining groundwater level and water productivity along with declining soil health. Climate change further complexes the things in one or other way. Therefore, the intervention of climate smart technologies is urgent for improving water productivity in an enormous water use RWCS of South-Asia. Although, farmers are confused regarding picking of suitable climate smart technology (CST) viz., laser land leveling, un-puddled direct-seeded rice (UPDSR), soil matric potential based irrigation, double zero tillage in wheat followed by rice, raised bed planting, short duration cultivars and correct transplantation time, for enhancing their livelihoods through increasing land and water productivity on one side and mitigating global warming consequences on other. Performance of these technologies is both site and situation specific, and care must be taken in practicing them. Most of them cutting down the drainage losses, which further reduces recharging of soil profile which is not required in water stressed regions while these might be termed as energy-saving technologies; otherwise used to withdraw water from the deeper soil depths. These CST are also useful for waterlogged regions. However, CST viz. correct transplantation time and short duration cultivars partition higher fraction of ET water (evapotranspiration) from E (evaporation) to T (transpiration) component which further favour higher grain yields and thus, higher water productivity. Therefore, it is crucial for introduction of CST for improving agricultural and water productivity in the era of climate change in an enormous water use RWCS of South-Asia.

AB  - The watershed of the Ningxia-Inner Mongolia Reach of the Yellow River (NIMRYR) suffers from serious wind-erosion hazard from several deserts distributed in this watershed. A mass of aeolian sediment is fed into the Yellow River directly or by its tributaries, which clogs the channel and causes major disasters in local regions. To prevent siltation of the Yellow River, it is urgent to understand the spatial variability and patterns of wind erosion in the NIMRYR watershed. For this purpose, the Integrated Wind-Erosion Modelling System (IWEMS) and the Revised Wind-Erosion Equation (RWEQ) were used to estimate the potential wind erosion rate (PWER) and to map wind-erosion risk in this watershed. In this study, the IWEMS model was used to calculate the PWER in non-arable lands, and the PWER in arable lands was estimated by the RWEQ model. The results show that the average PWER in the NIMRYR watershed ranged between 0 and 31440.4 t/km(2)/a from 2001 to 2010. The areas with tolerable erosion, slight erosion, moderate erosion, severe erosion, very severe erosion, and destructive erosion occupied 31.04%, 38.13%, 22.89%, 6.46%, 0.93%, and 0.55% of the total watershed area, respectively. The assessment results showed that sandy lands have the highest wind-erosion risk and that the risk in arable lands is lowest. The average annual quantity of aeolian sediment blown into the NIMRYR was 15.87 Mt between 2001 and 2010, and that blown into the Ten Tributaries was 7.33 Mt. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Water deficits and unusually warm soil temperatures can adversely affect conventional ridge sown systems. Increasingly serious water and temperature issues associated with global climate change may be problematic in the future, particularly in semiarid regions. This study explored the soil water and crop yield benefits of switching the sowing location of corn from ridges to furrows. Experiments were conducted over three years. Corn was grown in shallow furrow (SF) and deep furrow (DF) sown treatments until the V8 stage (eight visible leaf collars). New ridges were then built over the existing furrows. Grain yield was found to be higher in the SF and DF sown treatments than in a conventional ridge sown treatment (CR), especially in drought years. Switching sowing position from ridge to furrow could increase corn yield, directly, by improving soil moisture early in the growing season and, indirectly, by stimulating the growth of resource-capturing organs (e.g., leaves and roots). This simple and efficient approach to crop production in semiarid climates may be practical for the management of numerous agricultural systems, particularly those that are resource-limited, with greater vulnerability to the effects of global climate change.

AB  - Palmer amaranth (Amaranthus palmeri S. Watson) is the most problematic weed in agronomic crop production fields in the United States. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of degree of water stress on the growth and fecundity of A. palmeri using soil moisture sensors under greenhouse conditions. Two A. palmeri biotypes collected from Nebraska were grown in loam soil maintained at 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, and 12.5% soil field capacity (FC) corresponding to no, light, moderate, high, and severe water stress levels, respectively. Water was regularly added to pots based on soil moisture levels detected by Watermark or Decagon 5TM sensors to maintain the desired water stress level. Amaranthus palmeri plants maintained at 25% FC did not survive more than 35 d after transplanting. Amaranthus palmeri at 100%, 75%, and 50% FC produced similar numbers of leaves (588 to 670 plant-1) based on model estimates; however, plants at 100% FC achieved a maximum height of 178 cm compared with 124 and 88 cm at 75% and 50% FC, respectively. The growth index (1.1 x 10(5) to 1.4x 10(5) cm(3) plant(-1)) and total leaf area (571 to 693 cm(2 )plant(-1)) were also similar at 100%, 75%, and 50% FC. Amaranthus palmeri produced similar root biomass (2.3 to 3 g plant(-1)) at 100%, 75%, and 50% FC compared with 0.6 to 0.7 g plant(-1) at 25% and 12.5% FC, respectively. Seed production was greatest (42,000 seeds plant(-1)) at 100% FC compared with 75% and 50% FC (14,000 to 19,000 seeds plant(-1)); however, the cumulative seed germination was similar (38% to 46%) when mother plants were exposed to 50% FC. The results of this study show that A. palmeri can survive 50% FC continuous water stress conditions and can produce a significant number of seeds with no effect of on seed germination.

AB  - Long-term climate records of soil moisture are of increased importance to climate researchers. In this study, we aim to evaluate the quality of three different fusion approaches that combine soil moisture retrieval from multiple satellite sensors. The arrival of L-band missions has led to an increased focus on the integration of L-band-based soil moisture retrievals in climate records, emphasizing the need to improve our understanding based on its added value within a multi-sensor framework. The three evaluated approaches were developed on 10-year passive microwave data (2003-2013) from two different satellite sensors, i.e., SMOS (2010-2013) and AMSR-E (2003-2011), and are based on a neural network (NN), regressions (REG), and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM). The ability of the different approaches to best match AMSR-E and SMOS in their overlapping period was tested using an inter-comparison exercise between the SMOS and AMSR-E datasets, while the skill of the individual soil moisture products, based on anomalies, was evaluated using two verification techniques; first, a data assimilation technique that links precipitation information to the quality of soil moisture (expressed as the R-value), and secondly the triple collocation analysis (TCA). ASCAT soil moisture was included in the skill evaluation, representing the active microwave-based counterpart of soil moisture retrievals. Besides a semi-global analysis, explicit focus was placed on two regions that have strong land-atmosphere coupling, the Sahel (SA) and the central Great Plains (CGP) of North America. The NN approach gives the highest correlation coefficient between SMOS and AMSR-E, closely followed by LPRM and REG, while the absolute error is approximately the same for all three approaches. The R-value and TCA show the strength of using different satellite sources and the impact of different merging approaches on the skill to correctly capture soil moisture anomalies. The highest performance is found for AMSR-E over sparse vegetation, for SMOS over moderate vegetation, and for ASCAT over dense vegetation cover. While the two SMOS datasets (L3 and LPRM) show a similar performance, the three AMSR-E datasets do not. The good performance for AMSR-E over spare vegetation is mainly perceived for AMSR-E LPRM, benefiting from the physically based model, while AMSR-E NN shows improved skill in densely vegetated areas, making optimal use of the SMOS L3 training dataset. AMSR-E REG has a reasonable performance over sparsely vegetated areas; however, it quickly loses skill with increasing vegetation density. The findings over the SA and CGP mainly reflect results that are found in earlier sections. This confirms that historical soil moisture datasets based on a combination of these sources are a valuable source of information for climate research.

AB  - Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) fill the gap between locally measured in-situ soil moisture (SM) and remotely sensed SM by providing accurate SM estimation at the field scale. This is promising for improving hydrologic model predictions, as CRNS can provide valuable information on SM in the root zone at the typical scale of a model grid cell. In this study, SM measurements from a network of 12 CRNS in the Rur catchment (Germany) were assimilated into the Terrestrial System Modeling Platform (TSMP) to investigate its potential for improving SM, evapotranspiration (ET) and river discharge characterization and estimating soil hydraulic parameters at the larger catchment scale. The data assimilation (DA) experiments (with and without parameter estimation) were conducted in both a wet year (2016) and a dry year (2018) with the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), and later verified with an independent year (2017) without DA. The results show that SM characterization was significantly improved at measurement locations (with up to 60% root mean square error (RMSE) reduction), and that joint state-parameter estimation improved SM simulation more than state estimation alone (more than 15% additional RMSE reduction). Jackknife experiments showed that SM at verification locations had lower and different improvements in the wet and dry years (an RMSE reduction of 40% in 2016 and 16% in 2018). In addition, SM assimilation was found to improve ET characterization to a much lesser extent, with a 15% RMSE reduction of monthly ET in the wet year and 9% in the dry year.
   Assimilation of soil moisture from a network of cosmic-ray neutron sensors improves soil moisture characterization at the catchment scale Soil moisture characterization improved more in a wet year than in a very dry year Evapotranspiration and river discharge simulation are only slightly improved, despite better estimations of soil moisture

AB  - When utilizing optical sensors to make in-season agronomic recommendations in winter wheat, one parameter often required is the in-season grain yield potential at the time of sensing. Current estimates use an estimate of biomass, such as normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and growing degree days (GDDs) from planting to NDVI data collection. The objective of this study was to incorporate soil moisture data to improve the ability to predict final grain yield in-season. Crop NDVI, GDDs that were adjusted based upon if there was adequate water for crop growth, and the amount of soil profile (0-0.80 m) water were incorporated into a multiple linear regression model to predict final grain yield. Twenty-two site-years of N fertility trials with in-season grain yield predictions for growth stages ranging from Feekes 3 to 10 were utilized to calibrate the model. Three models were developed: one for all soil types, one for loamy soil textured sites, and one for coarse soil textured sites. The models were validated with 11 independent site-years of NDVI and weather data. The results indicated there was no added benefit to having separate models based upon soil types. Typically, the models that included soil moisture, more accurately predicted final grain yield. Across all site years and growth stages, yield prediction estimates that included soil moisture had an R-2 = 0.49, while the current model without a soil moisture adjustment had an R-2 = 0.40.

AB  - The maintenance of elevated soil moisture is an important ecosystem service of the natural ecosystems. Understanding the patterns of soil moisture distribution is useful to a wide range of agencies concerned with the weather and climate, soil conservation, agricultural production and landscape management. However, the great heterogeneity in the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture and the lack of standard methods to estimate this property limit its quantification and use in research. This literature based review aims to (i) compile the available knowledge on the methods used to estimate soil moisture at the landscape level, (ii) compare and evaluate the available methods on the basis of common parameters such as resource efficiency, accuracy of results and spatial coverage and (iii) identify the method that will be most useful for forested landscapes in developing countries. On the basis of the strengths and weaknesses of each of the methods reviewed we conclude that the direct method (gravimetric method) is accurate and inexpensive but is destructive, slow and time consuming and does not allow replications thereby having limited spatial coverage. The suitability of indirect methods depends on the cost, accuracy, response time, effort involved in installation, management and durability of the equipment. Our review concludes that measurements of soil moisture using the Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) methods are instantaneously obtained and accurate. GPR may be used over larger areas (up to 500 x 500 m a day) but is not cost-effective and difficult to use in forested landscapes in comparison to TDR. This review will be helpful to researchers, foresters, natural resource managers and agricultural scientists in selecting the appropriate method for estimation of soil moisture keeping in view the time and resources available to them and to generate information for efficient allocation of water resources and maintenance of soil moisture regime.

AB  - The accurate monitoring of soil moisture is critical for many environmental and hydrological applications, and commercial sensors have been used widely to detect the soil water content. However, the sensitivity of these sensors to the soil texture and bulk density demands calibration before conducting determinations. In the present study, we calibrated two soil moisture sensors (TDR-315L and Diviner 2000) for six common soil types found on the Loess Plateau, China. The root mean square error (RMSE), ratio of the lack-of-fit mean square error and mean square pure error were calculated to compare the accuracies of the sensors and models. The results indicated that TDR-315L was more accurate than Diviner 2000 for all of the samples. A new model that includes the bulk density and clay content obtained higher accuracy when calibrating the TDR-315L sensor. And it is showed that the RMSE of volumetric water content (VWC) from the new model compared to the gravimetry are less than 0.039 m(3) m(-3). For the Diviner 2000 sensor, adjusting the parameters in the calibration model allowed the accurate estimation of the VWC, where the RMSE of VWC from the calibration model compared to the gravimetry are less than 0.033 m(3) m(-3). The results obtained in this study may facilitate the use of sensors in soil moisture observational networks and environmental and hydrological applications.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in various fields such as agriculture, hydrology, and land-atmosphere interactions. This study aims to evaluate the performance of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) in comparison to other multiple-boosting algorithms for SM prediction. Appropriate feature selection is vital for achieving accurate predictions, and this study focuses on identifying relevant features and assessing CatBoost's suitability for the task. The study incorporates several boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and CatBoost to estimate SM. Results indicate that radar backscatter coefficient, soil roughness, and digital elevation model (DEM) are crucial features for SM retrieval. Comparatively, CatBoost outperforms GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM in various feature combinations. The most favorable results are obtained when utilizing all features as inputs for the algorithm. These optimal results yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.40 vol.%, mean relative error (MRE) of 0.16 vol.%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.26 vol.%, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73. Additionally, the study analyzes the inversion results for different ranges of SM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Within the range of SM from 0 to 25 vol.% and NDVI from 0 to 0.7, utilizing all features yields the most accurate results. Using CatBoost, this approach achieves an MAE of 1.52 vol.%, MRE of 0.12 vol.%, RMSE of 2.11 vol.%, and R of 0.81. The study suggests that applying boosting algorithms, especially CatBoost, holds promise in accurately estimating surface SM.

AB  - In this paper, bias correction approaches are investigated to understand their impact on assimilating active and/or passive microwave observations on near-surface soil moisture (SM) estimates. Synthetic and field observations were assimilated in a soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer model linked with an integrated active-passive model at L-band for bare soil. The two bias correction methods included in this study are the online bias correction with feedback (BCWF) with extended implementation with nonlinear observation operators and the simultaneous state parameter (SSP) update. New equations for BCWF were derived for the case of nonlinear observation operators because current versions of this approach were not applicable for improving SM by assimilating microwave observations. In SSP, the bias is compensated by tunning the values of the parameters. The two approaches resulted in similar accuracy for improving SM estimates compared with the uncorrected estimates. SSP showed the highest certainty for both synthetic and field observations. Using the bias correction methods, the mean estimates of SM improved by up to 88%, 87%, and 94%, when passive, active, and active-passive synthetic observations were assimilated, respectively, compared with the open-loop estimates. In contrast, when assimilating field observations from the Eleventh MicrowaveWater Energy Balance Experiment, the mean estimates of SM improved by up to 44%, 18%, and 48%, when passive, active, and active-passive observations were assimilated, respectively, compared with open-loop estimates. The decrement in improving the SM estimates suggests sources of uncertainty other than those from model parameters and forcings.

AB  - Soil moisture in root zone soil layers is one of the most important indicators of agricultural drought. Thus, monitoring agricultural drought requires not only knowledge of rainfall anomaly but also quantification of soil moisture. In this study, the effects of various methods of quantifying the green vegetation fraction green vegetation fraction (GVF) on the land-surface-model (LSM)-based soil moisture drought index (SMDI) were assessed using the harvest area data of the World Meteorological Organization together with the widely used vegetation health index and drought severity index. GVF data used in this study include monthly climatological GVF, weekly advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-normalized difference vegetation index-based and 8-daily moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI)-based GVF. The results show that SMDI is optimized when using the near-real-time GVF and that LAI-based GVF increases the accuracy of SMDI when monitoring early agricultural drought. The study shows that we can be confident in the accuracy of signals of emerging drought, particularly during the rapid onset of drought.

AB  - Scientists, environmentalists, and farmers are currently in pursuit of sustainable agricultural practices that can effectively ensure global food security while simultaneously mitigating environmental degradation. A field experiment was conducted to elucidate the impact of low-cost capacitance soil moisture-based sensors on lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) irrigation water conservation, agro-physiological aspects, and nutritional characteristics. The experiment also involved the use of five different types of soil mulching films: white geotextile (WGup), green geotextile (GGup), black plastic (BPup), white geotextile for both above and below ground (WGup-down), green geotextile for both above and below ground (GGup-down), in addition to un-mulched soil (control). The findings demonstrated that the application of WGup, BPup, WGup&down, and GGup&down resulted in a significant improvement in irrigation water conservation, with WGup exhibiting the highest savings at 41.86%, while the control group exhibited the least amount of water savings at 19.87%. Moreover, the highest productivity levels were observed in plants mulched with GGup&down, reaching 47,944.68 kg ha(-1), whereas the lowest productivity was recorded in plants mulched with green geotextile GGup at 22,377.89 kg ha(-1). In terms of irrigation water productivity (IWP), the order of effectiveness was BPup > GGup-down > WGup > WGup-down > GGup > Control, with BPup achieving the highest IWP at 60.19 kg m(-3) and the control treatment reporting the lowest at 27.80 kg m(-3). The percentage of the irrigation water applied for crop evapotranspiration (Irc) showed that the control treatment saved the least amount of irrigation water, saving only 19.87%, while the best treatment was WGup, achieved the highest percentage of irrigation water savings at 41.86%. Additionally, mulched plants exhibited higher levels of nutrients (N, P, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and Zn), ascorbic acid (AsA), and total phenol content (TPC), while showing lower nitrate content in the leaves compared to non-mulched plants. Overall, the utilization of soil moisture-based capacitance sensors and biodegradable mulching films has proven to be highly effective and low cost by 16.633 US$ year(-1) to enhance irrigation water productivity, growth performance, nutritional quality, and overall productivity of lettuce crops, thereby contributing to the sustainability of lettuce production in arid regions.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) fertilization is commonly based on soil testing, for which a variety of different soil P extraction methods are in use. In this research, the correlation and calibration of five extraction techniques for available P were studied: Soltanpour and Schwab, Olsen, EDTA-Na-2, Paauw and Morgan in 168 different soil samples from 63000 ha of Sirjan pistachio orchards of Kerman province, Iran. The Morgan reagent extracted the most P and then EDTA-Na-2> Olsen> Soltanpour and Schwab> Paauw extracted more phosphorus, respectively. Positive and significant correlation (P < 0.05) existed among all extractants. The correlation coefficients between different extractants and plant P concentration indicated that, EDTA-Na-2 (P < 0.01), Olsen and Paauw methods (P < 0.05) had positive and significant correlation with leaf P concentration and thus with due attention to acceptable relationship with plant indices, the Olsen and EDTA-Na-2 methods could be used to advise on available P.

TI  - Investigating temporal field sampling strategies for site-specific calibration of three soil moisture-neutron intensity parameterisation methods
T2  - HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES
LA  - English
KW  - BIAS
AB  - The Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) can provide soil moisture information at scales relevant to hydrometeorological modelling applications. Site-specific calibration is needed to translate CRNS neutron intensities into sensor footprint average soil moisture contents. We investigated temporal sampling strategies for calibration of three CRNS parameterisations (modified N-0, HMF, and COSMIC) by assessing the effects of the number of sampling days and soil wetness conditions on the performance of the calibration results while investigating actual neutron intensity measurements, for three sites with distinct climate and land use: a semi-arid site, a temperate grassland, and a temperate forest. When calibrated with 1 year of data, both COSMIC and the modified N-0 method performed better than HMF. The performance of COSMIC was remarkably good at the semi-arid site in the USA, while the N-0mod performed best at the two temperate sites in Germany. The successful performance of COSMIC at all three sites can be attributed to the benefits of explicitly resolving individual soil layers (which is not accounted for in the other two parameterisations). To better calibrate these parameterisations, we recommend in situ soil sampled to be collected on more than a single day. However, little improvement is observed for sampling on more than 6 days. At the semi-arid site, the N-0mod method was calibrated better under site-specific average wetness conditions, whereas HMF and COSMIC were calibrated better under drier conditions. Average soil wetness condition gave better calibration results at the two humid sites. The calibration results for the HMF method were better when calibrated with combinations of days with similar soil wetness conditions, opposed to N-0mod and COSMIC, which profited from using days with distinct wetness conditions. Errors in actual neutron intensities were translated to average errors specifically to each site. At the semi-arid site, these errors were below the typical measurement uncertainties from in situ point-scale sensors and satellite remote sensing products. Nevertheless, at the two humid sites, reduction in uncertainty with increasing sampling days only reached typical errors associated with satellite remote sensing products. The outcomes of this study can be used by researchers as a CRNS calibration strategy guideline.

AB  - This study quantifies soil nutrient balances of Integrated Agriculture-Aquaculture Systems in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. Eleven farms were monitored to collect data on farm activities and nutrient inputs and outputs to compute these balances of the rice-based and high input fish system in O Mon district (R-HF); the rice-based and medium input fish system in Tam Binh district (R-MF); and the orchard-based and low input fish system in Cai Be district (O-LF). For the estimation, the Nutmon model has been adapted to the specific conditions in these integrated systems in Asia (Nutmon-Asia). New regression models of leaching and gaseous losses of nitrogen were applied to fields used for upland crops and paddy rice. Reference values were used for the assessment of nitrogen fixation in paddy soils, wet atmospheric deposition, and irrigation water. The results showed that farms in all three systems have nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium surpluses (84 kg N, 73 kg P, and 69 kg K ha(-1) year(-1)). The O-LF system had the smallest nitrogen surplus while the smallest surplus of phosphorus and potassium was seen in the R-HF system. High surpluses of phosphorus and potassium were found in vegetable fields, whereas a negative potassium balance was found in the rice fields of all three systems. The positive farm nutrient balances indicate that it is likely that soil fertility will be maintained although there is a risk for environmental contamination.

AB  - Several variables have been used to estimate the soil moisture retention curve (SMRC) so far, but one of the main points in using pedotransfer functions (PTFs) is the selection of readily available soil properties as inputs. In this study, 147 disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were taken from five provinces of Iran. Some soil properties such as particle size distribution (PSD), bulk density (BD), free swelling index (FSI) and SMRC were measured. A double exponential model was fitted to the SMRC data, and PTFs were developed to predict the model parameters, by multivariate linear regression and artificial neural network (ANN) methods. Using FSI with the soil basic properties (silt to sand ratio, clay and BD) as estimators improved the estimation of SMRC significantly for the full data set by ANN method (by 10.9 and 9.0% in the training and testing steps, respectively), and in the textural groups of "clay loam, silty clay loam", "clay", "loam", "sandy loam" and "sand", by the linear regression method in the range of 1.0 to 14.9%. Grouping the soil samples significantly improved the accuracy of the estimates, especially in the sandy soil textural group. In estimating SMRC using total data, ANN method had a greater accuracy compared with the linear regression method. In general, FSI significantly improved the accuracy of parametric estimation of the SMRC and grouping of data had a positive impact on improving estimates in some textural groups.

AB  - Understanding soil test phosphorus (STP) and surface run-off phosphorus (P) relationships for soils is necessary for P management. The objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of various soil test indices to predict P losses in surface run-off. Selected sites were subjected to in situ rainfall simulations according to the protocol of the National Phosphorus Research Project (NPRP, 2001). P from a composite of twenty-four 2.0-cm-diameter core soil samples (0-5 cm) was extracted using the Olsen, Bray-Kurtz, Mehlich III, distilled water and 0.01 m calcium chloride procedures. All of these P extraction methods explained a significant amount of variability in surface run-off total dissolved P [TP (<0.45)] (r(2) >= 0.67; P <= 0.01), where 0.45 is the filter pore diameter in microns. Multiple regression models showed extractable P to be the best soil predictor of surface run-off TP (<0.45) among the studied soils. Despite extraction method or soil type, extractable P was the best soil predictor of surface runoff TP (<0.45). Either agronomic (0.92 <= r(2) <= 0.96) or environmental (0.94 <= r(2) <= 0.96) soil tests were effective in estimating surface run-off TP (<0.45) in select Mollisols.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) fertilization is commonly based on soil testing, for which a variety of different soil P extraction methods are in use. The aim of this study was to compare 14 soil P extraction methods in terms of their extraction yield and their relation to soil properties. Fifty contrasting agricultural topsoils were sampled from Austria and Germany. The soils were extracted with the following methods/extractants: H2O, CaCl2, LiCl, Olsen, Bray and Kurtz II (Bray II), Mehlich 3, calcium-acetate-lactate (CAL), iron oxide impregnated filter papers (Fe-oxide P-i), cation and anion exchange membranes (CAEM), acid ammonium oxalate, citrate-bicarbonate-dithionite, HCl, organic P and total P. The extracted P varied over three orders of magnitude and increased in the order H2O < CaCl2 < LiCl < Fe-oxide P-i < Olsen < CAL < CAEM < Mehlich 3 < Bray II < dithionite < organic P < HCl < oxalate < total P. This sequence is in accordance with previous studies and reflects different extraction mechanisms and P pools. The different extraction methods were generally well correlated, especially when P extraction was achieved by a similar mechanism. The soil properties most influential on P extractability were pH, carbonate content, texture as well as iron oxide content and crystallinity. Our results show that the different extraction methods extract distinct pools of soil P with strongly varying extractability, and that the extractability of a given pool may be influenced by different soil properties to different extents. If and how these relationships translate to plant P uptake requires further examination.

AB  - The brightness temperature (BT) and backscattering coefficient (BSC) measured simultaneously by passive and active microwave sensors have great potential for the estimation of land surface soil moisture (SM). Several methods with combined passive and active microwave remote sensing observations for SM have been reported. Usually, the use of these methods, requires an accurate roughness condition, especially when dealing over the bare surface or surface with low vegetation. In this paper, two different retrieval methods for estimating SM using synthetic microwave remote sensing data were compared. The difference between the two methods is the way to estimate the roughness parameter. The three-parameter retrieval approach (THRA) takes the roughness parameter as a variable to be retrieved, and derives land surface parameters (e.g., SM, surface temperature (ST) and roughness) simultaneously from BT and BSC using nonlinear algorithms. The two-parameter retrieval approach (TWRA) retrieves roughness from BSC firstly, then takes the roughness as an input parameter to retrieve SM and ST from BT. The two retrieval methods were applied on AMSR-E (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) and QuikSCAT/Seawinds (The Seawinds scatterometer on NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Quick Scatterometer) observations which have been carried out for the SMEX03 (Soil Moisture Experiment 2003) region in ON, the north of Oklanoma. The comparison results shows TWRA has achieved a higher accuracy than THRA in dealing with the active and passive microwave observations at different overpass times. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems, combining agricultural alley crops with rows of hardwood trees, are largely absent in Canada. We tested the hypothesis that the roots of 5-8 years old hybrid poplars, growing in two TBI systems in southern Qu,bec, would play a "safety-net" role of capturing nutrients leaching below the rooting zone of alley crops. TBI research plots at each site were trenched to a depth of 1 m on each side of an alley. Control plots were left with tree roots intact. In each treatment at each site, leachate at 70 cm soil depth was repeatedly sampled over two growing seasons using porous cup tension lysimeters, and analyzed for nutrient concentrations. Daily water percolation rates were estimated with the forest hydrology model ForHyM. Average nutrient concentrations for all days between consecutive sampling dates were multiplied by water percolation rates, yielding daily nutrient leaching loss estimates for each sampling step. We estimated that tree roots in the TBI system established on clay loam soil decreased subsoil NO(3) (-) leaching by 227 kg N ha(-1) and 30 kg N ha(-1) over two consecutive years, and decreased dissolved organic N (DON) leaching by 156 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in the second year of the study. NH(4) (+) leaching losses at the same site were higher when roots were present, but were 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than NO(3) (-) or DON leaching. At the sandy textured site, the safety net role of poplar roots with respect to N leaching was not as effective, perhaps because N leaching rates exceeded root N uptake by a wider margin than at the clay loam site. At the sandy textured site, significant and substantial reductions of sodium leaching were observed where tree roots were present. At both sites, tree roots reduced DON concentrations and the ratio of DON to inorganic N, perhaps by promoting microbial acquisition of DON through rhizodeposition. This study demonstrated a potential safety-net role by poplar roots in 5-8 year-old TBI systems in cold temperate regions.

AB  - Accurate estimation of precipitation from satellite precipitation products (PPs) over the complex topography and diverse climate of Pakistan with limited rain gauges (RGs) is an arduous task. In the current study, we assessed the performance of two PPs estimated from soil moisture (SM) using the SM2RAIN algorithm, SM2RAIN-CCI and SM2RAIN-ASCAT, on the daily scale across Pakistan during the periods 2000-2015 and 2007-2015, respectively. Several statistical metrics, i.e., Bias, unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), Theil's U, and the modified Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) score, and four categorical metrics, i.e., probability of detection (POD), false alarm ratio (FAR), critical success index (CSI), and Bias score, were used to evaluate these two PPs against 102 RGs observations across four distinct climate regions, i.e., glacial, humid, arid and hyper-arid regions. Total mean square error (MSE) is decomposed into systematic (MSEs) and random (MSEr) error components. Moreover, the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Multi-Satellite Precipitation Analysis (TRMM TMPA 3B42v7) was used to assess the performance of SM2RAIN-based products at 0.25 degrees scale during 2007-2015. Results shows that SM2RAIN-based product highly underestimated precipitation in north-east and hydraulically developed areas of the humid region. Maximum underestimation for SM2RAIN-CCI and SM2RIAN-ASCAT were 58.04% and 42.36%, respectively. Precipitation was also underestimated in mountainous areas of glacial and humid regions with maximum underestimations of 43.16% and 34.60% for SM2RAIN-CCI. Precipitation was overestimated along the coast of Arabian Sea in the hyper-arid region with maximum overestimations for SM2RAIN-CCI (SM2RAIN-ASCAT) of 59.59% (52.35%). Higher ubRMSE was observed in the vicinity of hydraulically developed areas. Theil's U depicted higher accuracy in the arid region with values of 0.23 (SM2RAIN-CCI) and 0.15 (SM2RAIN-ASCAT). Systematic error components have larger contribution than random error components. Overall, SM2RAIN-ASCAT dominates SM2RAIN-CCI across all climate regions, with average percentage improvements in bias (27.01% in humid, 5.94% in arid, and 6.05% in hyper-arid), ubRMSE (19.61% in humid, 20.16% in arid, and 25.56% in hyper-arid), Theil's U (9.80% in humid, 28.80% in arid, and 26.83% in hyper-arid), MSEs (24.55% in humid, 13.83% in arid, and 8.22% in hyper-arid), MSEr (19.41% in humid, 29.20% in arid, and 24.14% in hyper-arid) and KGE score (5.26% in humid, 28.12% in arid, and 24.72% in hyper-arid). Higher uncertainties were depicted in heavy and intense precipitation seasons, i.e., monsoon and pre-monsoon. Average values of statistical metrics during monsoon season for SM2RAIN-CCI (SM2RAIN-ASCAT) were 20.90% (17.82%), 10.52 mm/day (8.61 mm/day), 0.47 (0.43), and 0.47 (0.55) for bias, ubRMSE, Theil's U, and KGE score, respectively. TMPA outperformed SM2RAIN-based products across all climate regions. SM2RAIN-based datasets are recommended for agricultural water management, irrigation scheduling, flood simulation and early flood warning system (EFWS), drought monitoring, groundwater modeling, and rainwater harvesting, and vegetation and crop monitoring in plain areas of the arid region.

AB  - Paddy rice in middle-to-high latitude areas has a longer growing period with lower temperature. Therefore, it was hypothesized to have a different soil ecohydrology pattern and nitrogen (N) efficiency. Based on daily monitoring of soil moisture and N concentrations in soil water at four depth layers, the characteristics and their ecohydrological interactions, soil environmental indexes and N dynamics were analyzed. The temporal-vertical observations of soil moisture and soil water acquisition rates demonstrated the existence of an impermeable soil layer at 30 cm, which had lower soil organic carbon content. The soil moisture greater in the upper layer had higher soil organic carbon content, which provided the critical conditions for the rice tillage. Lower than the 60 cm depth, the soil moisture increased and had a peak acquisition rate of approximately 0.0075 cm(3) s(-1). The concentration of NO3--N in the water at the soil subsurface was approximately 2.4 times than that of NH4+-N. The NO3--N had a larger concentration at the deeper layer as a result of downing leaching, but the NH4+-N had a greater concentration in the tops soil layer than the other depths. The soils under the influence of freeze-thawing had the largest TN concentration in surface water at the end of April, which was about three times than that of the peak during the growing period. This study aligned the interactions between the N dynamics with soil microclimatic factors such as temperature, water pH and moisture across the 90 cm profile. The temporal-vertical pattern of soil moisture and the N in soil water provided evidence for the hypothesis that the soil ecohydrology dynamics in this area. These findings were of particular significance to understanding the impacts of paddy rice ecohydrology with N dynamics in middle-to-high latitude areas, which can help to optimize the N availability and water efficiency.

AB  - Soil erosion is a multifactor threat to crop production and the environment. Most studies on soil erosion characterization have not focused on soil nutrient loss associated with erosion. The aim of this study was therefore to quantify the magnitude of nutrient loss through soil erosion under different cropping systems and amendments to inform agronomic practices in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). A field experiment was carried out on runoff plots with different cropping systems (sole maize, sole cowpea, sole maize and maize intercropped with soybean) as main plots and soil amendments (biochar, NPK (Nitrogen +Phosphorus +Potassium) fertilizer, NPK + biochar and a control (no amendment)) constituting the subplots in a randomized complete block design. For each block, a bare plot was included to assess the efficiency of the different crop and soil management practices on soil erosion. The study was carried out in three consecutive cropping seasons in the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana. The bare plots had the highest amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) eroded: 33.88, 12.35 and 12.75 kg ha(-1) respectively followed by the control plots with magnitude of 20.43, 8.42 and 7.87 kg ha(-1) respectively for N, P and K. Sole maize had the highest amounts of nutrient loss: 19.71, 8.12 and 7.27 for N, P and K respectively compared to all the other cropping systems where the losses varied respectively from 12.38 to 17.12, 6.67 to 7.49 and 5.81 to 6.75 kg ha(-1) The legume-based cropping systems under inorganic fertilizer and biochar management effectively reduced nutrient loss more than all other treatment combinations. The off-site effect of soil erosion expressed as enrichment ratio (ER) was higher for all plots, which received inorganic fertilizer inputs varying from 1.93 to 3.06 while the other treatments had ERs of 1.51 to 2.03. The ERs of fine soil particles were greater than 1 (ranging from 1.14 to 3.6) being relatively higher than that of coarse particles (sand) with values below 1 (ranging from 0.62 to 0.88). The least cumulative monetary value of nutrient loss (30.82 US$ ha(-1)) was observed under cowpea cropping system which received NPK + BC treatment. Soil erosion affected directly soil nutrient depletion through nutrient loss; however, integrated soil fertility management associated with legume-based cropping systems can be alternative options to reducing its effects on croplands in SSA.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of soil texture on phosphorus (P) extractability and sorption from a wide range of calcareous soils across Hamedan, western Iran. Fifty seven soil samples were selected and partitioned into five types on the basis of soil texture (clay, sandy, sandy clay loam, sandy loam and mixed loam) and the P extracted with calcium chloride (P-CaCl2), citrate (P-citrate), HCl (P-HCl), Olsen (P-Ols), and Mehlich-3 (P-M3) solutions. On the average, the P extracted was in the order P-HCl > P-M3 > P-citrate > P-Ols > P-CaCl2. The P extracted by Pcitrate, PHCl, P-Ols, and P-M3 methods were significantly higher in sandy, sandy clay loam and sandy loamtextures than clay and mixed loam textures, while soil phosphorus buffer capacity (PBC) was significantly higher in clay and mixed loam soil textures. The correlation analysis revealed a significant positive relationship between silt content Freundlich sorption coefficient (K-F), maximum P sorption (Q(max)), linear distribution coefficient (K-d), and PBC. All extractions were highly correlated with each other and among soil components with silt content. The principal component analysis (PCA) performed on data identified five principal components describing 74.5% of total variation. The results point to soil texture as an important factor and that silt was the crucial soil property associated with P sorption and its extractability in these calcareous soils. DPSM3-2 (P-M3/P-M3+Q(max) x 100) and DPScitrate (P-citrate/P-citrate+Q(max) x 100) proved to be good indicators of soil's potential P release in these calcareous soils. Among the DPS, 21% of soils reported DPSM3-2, values higher than the environmental threshold, indicating build-up of P and P release. Most of the studied sandy clay loam soils had exceeded the environmentally unacceptable P concentration. Various management practices should be taken into account to reduce P losses from these soils. Further inorganic and organic P fertilizer inputs should be reduced in some parts of studied area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Precipitation measurements provide crucial information for hydrometeorological applications. In regions where typical precipitation measurement gauges are sparse, gridded products aim to provide alternative data sources. This study examines the performance of NASA's Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for the Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (IMERG, GPM) satellite precipitation dataset in capturing the spatio-temporal variability of weather events compared to the German weather radar dataset RADOLAN RW. Besides quantity, also timing of rainfall is of very high importance when modeling or monitoring the hydrologic cycle. Therefore, detection metrics are evaluated along with standard statistical measures to test both datasets. Using indices like probability of detection allows a binary evaluation showing the basic categorical accordance of the radar and satellite data. Furthermore, a pixel-by-pixel comparison is performed to assess the ability to represent the spatial variability of rainfall and precipitation quantity. All calculations are additionally carried out for seasonal subsets of the data to assess potentially different behavior due to differences in precipitation schemes. The results indicate significant differences between the datasets. Overall, GPM IMERG overestimates the quantity of precipitation compared to RADOLAN, especially in the winter season. Moreover, shortcomings in detection performance arise in this season with significant erroneously-detected, yet also missed precipitation events compared to the weather radar data. Additionally, along secondary mountain ranges and the Alps, topographically-induced precipitation is not represented in GPM data, which generally shows a lack of spatial variability in rainfall and snowfall estimates due to lower resolution.

AB  - The use of geophysical data to accurately determine water levels is demonstrated for an aquifer within the Saint-Narcisse moraine in the Mauricie region of southeastern Quebec, Canada. Two numerical simulations were conducted using FEFLOW, one based on regional piezometric data and the other using geophysical data; the data were acquired through transient electromagnetic (TEM), electrical resistivity (ERT), and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) surveys. The three-dimensional geological and groundwater flow model was based on data from 94 boreholes, 5 stratigraphic cross-sections, and 20 TEM, 6 ERT (similar to 1.44 km) and 4 GPR (similar to 0.97 km) surveys. Both numerical analyses confirmed the simulated water levels, and the root mean square errors obtained from the piezometric data and the multiple geophysical techniques were similar at 3.81 and 2.76 m, respectively. Through a discrete modeling approach, this study shows that groundwater levels estimated using geophysical tools and methods and those determined by direct observation are comparable. The outcome illustrates how geophysical data can complement direct observations to provide additional hydraulic information to hydrologic modellers. Geophysical surveys provide an extensive set of soft data that can be leveraged to improve groundwater flow models and determine groundwater levels, particularly in areas characterized by limited direct piezometric information.

AB  - In upper layer of arable soils, the percentage of organically bound phosphorus (P) can range from 20% to 80% of total P concentration Approximately 40% of organic soil P is in the inositol-P fraction. The objective of our study was to evaluate various soil-testing methods in measuring phytate soil P as an important source of organic soil P, and to determine the bioavailability of phytate soil P for summer wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), rape (Brassica napus L.), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L var altissima Doll), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia L), maize (Zea mays L.), white lupin (Lupinus albus L.), Mexican sunflower (Tithonia diversifolia Hemsley Gray), summer rye (Secale cereale L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum L), and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan L.). Plants were cultivated in a growth chamber on a subsoil as a substrate with very low organic-matter content and negligible microbial activity in order to restrict the contribution of mycorrhiza and soil microbial activity for organic-soil P mobilization. Application of organic P (100 mg P [kg soil](-1) as Na-hexaphytate, C(6)H(6)O(24)P(6)Na(12)) did not result in a significant increase of extractable soil P measured with routine soil-testing methods (CAL, DL, NaHCO(3), EUF, Me-III) although the applied organic P was available for all tested plant species. The relative P-uptake efficiency for Na-hexaphytate compared to Ca(H(2)PO(4))(2) was for rape, pigeon pea, and phacelia approximately 100%, for white lupin and maize 80%, for sugar beet, Mexican sunflower, wheat, and buckwheat approximately 60%, and for rye 35%. The results indicate that the bioavailability of organic soil P is not taken into account by routine soil-testing methods.

AB  - Vegetation water content (VWC) is of vital significance to many applications in agriculture, such as crop yield estimation and precision irrigation. However, previous studies mainly estimate VWC at either high spatial resolution or temporal resolution due to the limitation of space-borne observation systems. In this paper, we target on monitoring daily plant VWC as well as canopy VWC at 30 m high spatial resolution with the fusion of optical measurements from the Land Remote Sensing Satellite (Landsat) Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) in an agricultural area. The study area locates in the central of Iowa, the United States (USA), the study period ranges from August 1 to August 17, 2016. Landsat 8 OLI observations are with 16-day revisit cycle and 30-m spatial resolution, MODIS daily surface reflectance product used in this study has 500-m spatial resolution. Six Landsat OLI images and thirty MODIS images were used to estimate daily remotely sensed reflectance data at 30m first. Then, the fused satellite measurements were used to calculate Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI). Ground-based plant VWC and canopy VWC measurements were collected during the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment (SMAPVEX16) to calibrate and validate the model for plant VMC and canopy VWC estimation separately with the NDWI. The results of validation with in-situ measurements showed an R-2 of 0.44 for the corn plant VWC, an R-2 of 0.66 for the corn canopy VWC; and an R-2 of 0.78 for the soybean plant VWC, an R-2 of 0.85 for the soybean canopy VWC, respectively.

AB  - Remote sensing of land surface temperature (LST) using infrared (IR) sensors, such as the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), is only capable of retrieval under clear-sky conditions. Such LST observations over tropical forests are very limited due to clouds and rainfall, particularly during the wet season and high atmospheric water-vapor content. In comparison, low-frequency microwave radiances are minimally influenced by meteorological conditions. Exploring this advantage, we have developed an algorithm to retrieve LST over the Amazonian forest. The algorithm uses multifrequency polarized microwave brightness temperatures from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on NASA's Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Relationships between polarization ratio and surface emissivity are established for forested and nonforested areas, such that LST can solely be calculated from microwave radiance. Results are presented over three time scales: at each orbit, daily, and monthly. Results are evaluated by comparing with available air-temperature records on daily and monthly intervals. Our findings indicate that the AMSR-E-derived LST agrees well with in situ measurements. Results during the wet season over the tropical forest suggest that the AMSR-E LST is robust under all-weather conditions and shows higher correlation to meteorological data (r = 0.70) than the IR-based LST approaches (r = 0.42).

AB  - Reduced tillage practices, including no-till, have been proposed to reduce NO3- leaching in agricultural soils. However, this is not universally supported by experimental data, and the effect of reduced tillage on NO3- leaching is likely connected to the interaction between macropore flow and resident solutes. To investigate this, we carried out infiltration experiments on intact soil cores from conventionally tilled (CT) and no-till (NT) plots, recording resident concentrations and breakthrough curves (BTCs) of three solutes (a tritium pulse, resident Br-tracer and native NO3-). We then fitted a dual porosity model implemented in HYDRUS-1D, to the experimental BTCs. By assuming different initial solute distributions between phases, we investigate possible bypass mechanisms. In the lysimeter experiment, leaching of all solutes initiated and peaked earlier in NT compared to CT, indicating increased macropore flow. However, total leached NO3- was greater in CT, and higher resident NO(3)(-)concentrations were found after the experiment in NT, suggesting an overall bypass effect. In the fitted dual porosity model, saturated water contents in the mobile phase were six times smaller in NT than in CT, with smaller horizontal solute transfer rates for NO3- than for Br-. The optimal initial proportion of total resident NO3- in the mobile phase was 7.5% in NT and 65% in CT. Our results suggest a bypass effect of native resident NO3- in NT soils related to a smaller volume of soil involved in macropore flow. Added solutes, however, remain susceptible to quicker leaching in NT compared to CT under intense precipitation.

AB  - Improved agronomic management strategies are needed to minimize the impact that current maize (Zea maysL.) and soybean (Glycine max(L.) Merr.) production practices have on soil erosion and nutrient losses, especially nitrogen (N). Interseeded cover crops in standing maize and soybean scavenge excess soil N and thus reduce potential N leaching and runoff. The objectives were to determine the impact that pennycress (Thlaspi arvenseL.) (PC), winter camelina (Camelina sativa(L.) Crantz) (WC), and winter rye (Secale cerealeL.) (WR) cover crops have on soil N, and carbon (C) and N accumulation in cover-crop biomass. The cover crops were interseeded in maize at the R5 growth stage and in soybean at R7 in four replicates over two growing seasons at four locations. Soil and aboveground biomass samples were taken in autumn and spring. Data from the maize and soybean systems were analyzed separately. The results showed that cover crops had no effect on soil NH4+-N under both systems. However, winter rye decreased soil NO3--N up to 76% compared with no-cover-crop treatment in the soybean system. Pennycress and WC scavenged less soil N than WR. Similarly, N and C accumulation in PC and WC biomass were less than in WR, in part because of their poor growth performance under the interseeding practice. Until PC and WC varieties with improved suitability for interseeding are developed, other agronomic practices may need to be explored for improving N scavenging in maize and soybean cropping systems to reduce nutrient leaching and enhance crop diversification.

AB  - The Southern Great Plains (SGP) region of the United States is widely known for its dryland dual-purpose winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems-integrated systems that provide both livestock grazing and grain production. Few of these systems are organic, however, and no relevant research had been conducted on this topic. A large-scale (41 ha) systems research study was conducted for 3 yr (2018-2021) to compare a transitional organic dual-purpose wheat system with a conventional one, with system management components customized to the ecological region. Organic wheat yield was 20% lower than conventional in the first season of organic transition, but there was no yield difference by the third year. The yield improvement in the organic system may be attributed to N fixation by a legume-based cash crop the previous winter season, exogenous nutrients from application of composted manure, and appropriate wheat cultivar selection. Because of limited moisture, relying on annual establishment of summer cover crops to fix N and deliver other ecosystem services in the organic system was not feasible in most years. Grain protein concentration (GPC) of the transitional organic wheat ranged from 91 to 103 g kg(-1), below the 120 g kg(-1) threshold for a food market organic price premium. More intensive N management, including in-season application of a more available form of N that is organic approved, could be an effective strategy to increase GPC. This proof-of-concept study shows that organic dual-purpose wheat systems can be a viable enterprise in the SGP, though additional research is needed to address challenges identified herein.

AB  - Irrigation management consists of many components. In this work we review and recommend rainfall forecast performance metrics and adjoint methodologies for the use of predictive weather data within the Colorado State University Water Irrigation Scheduler for Efficient Application (WISE). WISE estimates crop water uses to optimize irrigation scheduling. WISE and its components, input requirements, and related software design issues are discussed. The use of predictive weather allows WISE to consider economic opportunity-costs of decisions to defer water application if rainfall is forecast. These capabilities require an assessment of the system uncertainties and use of weather prediction performance probabilities. Rainfall forecasts and verification performance metrics are reviewed. In addition, model data assimilation methods and adjoint sensitivity concepts are introduced. These assimilation methods make use of observational uncertainties and can link performance metrics to space and time considerations. We conclude with implementation guidance, summaries of available data sources, and recommend a novel adjoint method to address the complex physical linkages and model sensitivities between space and time within the irrigation scheduling physics as a function of soil depth. Such tool improvements can then be used to improve water management decision performance to better conserve and utilize limited water resources for productive use.

AB  - Soil moisture or soil water content (SWC) is an important variable and its determination with an acceptable accuracy is an essential need for a variety of hydrological disciplines. Among the alternatives, permittivity based probes are gaining popularity and becoming established techniques. However, probes are affected by local soil conditions, requiring soil-specific calibrations for accurate and reliable measurements. Measurement errors associated with these probes can be classified in three groups as primary, secondary and tertiary. Primary errors are mostly associated with the underlying operating principles of a probe. Soil density variation is inherently the major source of secondary error as it can create a measurement error as much as 0.030 m(3) m(-3). The error associated with the secondary variables can be reduced by up to 0.015 m(3) m(-3) by targeting the half range of the density variations. Currently available techniques do not explicitly quantify/minimize the secondary errors. Tertiary errors arise mostly from user dependent factors associated with probe-soil contact discontinuities and unexpected small scale environmental variations in the vicinity of the measurement point.
   This study presents a unique approach in considering the natural variations of the dry density by proposing to conduct the soil specific calibrations on repacked samples under constant compaction/compression energy of 350 kN m/m(3). A simple probe insertion procedure was also employed by using guides and predrilling for probe rods in order to minimize the tertiary variables. A comparative assessment of the proposed calibration approach was conducted, considering a time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and two relatively affordable moisture probes with different operating principles (ThetaProbe ML2x and Wet-2 sensor). The findings of this study showed that accuracy levels of 0.012 m(3) m(-3), 0.015 m(3) m(-3) and 0.016 m(3) m(-3), through Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), were achieved for TDR, ThetaProbe and WET sensor, respectively, for a wide range of soil types including the clays and silts. It is concluded that the proposed constant energy calibration approach help contain the secondary effects due to density variation in a tight range and that the recommended probe installation procedure help minimize the tertiary effects associated with the probe-soil contact discontinuities.

AB  - The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKE) and sequential importance resampling (SIR) are two Monte Carlo-based sequential data assimilation (DA) methods developed to solve the filtering problem in nonlinear systems. Both methods present drawbacks when applied to physically-based nonlinear models: the EnKF update is affected by the inherent Gaussian approximation, while SIR may require a large number of Monte Carlo realizations to ensure consistent updates. In this work we implemented EnKF and SIR into a physically-based coupled surface-subsurface flow model and applied it to a synthetic test case that considers a uniform soil v-shaped catchment subject to rainfall and evaporation events. After a sensitivity analysis on the number of Monte Carlo realizations and the correlation time of the atmospheric forcing, the comparison between the two filters is done on the basis of different simulation scenarios varying observations (outlet streamflow and/or pressure head), assimilation frequency, and type of bias (atmospheric forcing or initial conditions). The results demonstrate that both EnKF and SIR are suitable DA methods for detailed physically-based hydrological modeling using the same, relatively small, ensemble size. We highlight that the Gaussian approximation in the EnKF updates leads to a state estimation that can be not consistent with the physics of the model, resulting in a slowdown of the numerical solver. SIR instead duplicates physically consistent realizations, but can display difficulties in updates when the realizations are far from the true state. We propose and test a modification of the SIR algorithm to overcome this issue and preserve assimilation efficiency. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Current agricultural systems heavily rely on intensive tillage and inorganic fertilizer inputs. This tradition increases the cost of agricultural production and negatively affects agricultural systems and environment. Conservation practices, such as cover crops (CCs) and no-till (NT), could serve as a management approach to promote soil health and agricultural sustainability. There is limited understanding of CCs effect on soil properties, crop growth and yield under different tillage systems in the humid sub-tropical region of the US. This study evaluated the effect of winter cover crops [wheat (Triticum aestivum) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa)] and different tillage systems [NT and conventional till (CT)] on soil moisture dynamics, plant nutrients, and soybean (Glycine max) growth and yield in a very fine sandy loam soil from winter 2015 to summer 2018. Results showed significant effect of both tillage and cover crops on soil moisture and infiltration rates during soybean production. Average soil moisture content in the 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths was 7.9 and 4.3% higher in the CT than in the NT system, respectively. Cover crops increased soil moisture in 0-30 cm depth by 3 to 5% compared to control plots. No-till increased the percolation rate by 20 to 30% at the 20 to 40 cm depth compared to CT. Cover crop biomass yield in 2017 was significantly affected by CC type, tillage system and their interaction. While CCs had no significant impact on soybean height at harvest, CT increased plant height by 25% and 33% compared with NT for 2016 and 2017, respectively. Soybean yield averaged 3.24 Mg ha(-1) across years in CT and 3.02 Mg ha(-1) in NT system during 2016 to 2018. Vetch tended to produce higher soybean yield compared to wheat and control. Overall, cover crops could improve soil quality and increase crop yield in humid sub-tropical regions, but such effects vary with CCs type and tillage system.

AB  - Understanding the role of N-fixing leguminous trees for phosphorus (P) cycling in highly weathered tropical soils is relevant for the conservation of natural forests as well as the sustainable management of agroforests and forest plantations with low P input in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest region. We hypothesized that N-fixing leguminous trees can increase the availability of soil P by exploiting different P sources without causing a depletion of soil organic P due to efficient biogeochemical cycling, but empirical evidence remains scarce. For this purpose, P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P-31 NMR) was used for quantifying soil P forms and the Hedley sequential extraction to determine soil P fractions. The studied sites were forestry systems with leguminous trees: mixed forest plantations with different proportions of fast-growing N-fixing leguminous trees; pure plantations, and agroforestry systems with leguminous trees The results show that all N-fixing leguminous trees and N mineral fertilization positively affected the concentrations of available soil P in relation to the control treatments. There were increases of all P fractions through cycling in all forest sites. P-31 NMR spectra clearly identified and quantified that a large amount of phosphomonoesters followed by phosphodiesters in the form of DNA, as well as high reserves of P, species (orthu-P and pyrophosphate) in the first eleven years of growth at pure plantations, mixed plantations or agroforests. The relations between both orthu-P and DNA with the resin-P-i, NaHCO3-P-i, and NaOH-P-i, fractions suggest that both analysis methods provide complementary information about the soil P transformations. Thus, the paper highlights the importance of the use of different N-fixing leguminous tree species under different environmental conditions, production systems and management practices for recovering heavily degraded areas, which may be a suitable strategy through efficient management of P in highly weathered tropical soils in the Brazilian Atlantic Forest biome.

AB  - Agricultural phosphorus (P) application leads to the accumulation and release of soil P, which pose ecosystem risks. Different farming systems carry substantial risks of soil P release. This study evaluated the risk of soil P release in three representative systems of paddy fields in China (rice fields (RF), integrated crayfish-rice fields (CRF), and crayfish fields (CF)) using indoor adsorption and desorption experiments and the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) technique, and compared the obtained results. The soils of RF and CRF showed higher levels of redox potential (Eh), free Fe-Al oxides (DCB-Fe, DCB-Al), and amorphous Fe-Al oxides (Ox-Fe, Ox-Al) compared to CF. Additionally, the soils of CRF and CF exhibited higher total organic carbon (TOC) content. The indoor experiments revealed a positive correlation between the contents of Ox-Fe, Ox-Al, bioavailable P (BAP), clay, and soil P adsorption characteristics. Desorption characteristics were primarily influenced by total P, TOC, and Ox-Fe content. Furthermore, the order of soil P release risk followed CRF > RF > CF. According to the in situ DGT measurements, the soil P release fluxes were 0.266 mg & sdot; m(-2)& sdot; d(-1) for CRF, 0.548 mg & sdot;m(-2)& sdot;d(-1) for RF, and 0.583 mg & sdot; m(-2)& sdot; d(-1) for CF. Accordingly, the risk of soil P release followed the order CRF < RF < CF. The contrasting results from these two methods are attributable to the indoor experiments indicating the potential for soil P adsorption under specific experimental conditions and the in situ DGT reflecting natural soil P release in a more effective and suitable manner for evaluating soil P release. The findings improve our understanding of the risk of soil P loss in CRF and provides valuable insights into the two methods.

AB  - Mesoscale convective systems (MCS) are known to develop under ideal conditions of temperature and humidity profiles and large-scale dynamic forcing. Recent work, however, has shown that summer MCS events can occur under weak synoptic forcing or even unfavorable large-scale environments. When baroclinic forcing is weak, convection may be triggered by anomalous conditions at the land surface. This work evaluates land surface conditions for summer MCS events forming in the U.S. Great Plains using an MCS database covering the contiguous United States east of the Rocky Mountains, in boreal summers 2004-16. After isolatingMCS cases where synoptic-scale influences are not the main driver of development (i.e., only non-squall-line storms), antecedent soil moisture conditions are evaluated over two domain sizes (1.25 degrees and 5 degrees squares) centered on the mean position of the storm initiation. A negative correlation between soil moisture and MCS initiation is identified for the smaller domain, indicating that MCS events tend to be initiated over patches of anomalously dry soils of similar to 100-km scale, but not significantly so. For the larger domain, soil moisture heterogeneity, with anomalously dry soils (anomalously wet soils) located southwest (northeast) of the initiation point, is associated with MCS initiation. This finding is similar to previous results in the Sahel and Europe that suggest that induced meso-beta circulations from surface heterogeneity can drive convection initiation.

AB  - A study of phosphorus accumulation and mobility was conducted in eight pastures in the Georgia piedmont, USA. We compared two potential grazing treatments: strategic-grazing (STR) and continuous-grazing-with-hay-distribution (CHD) from 2015 (Baseline) to 2018 (Post-Treatment) for (1) distribution of Mehlich-1 Phosphorus (M1P) in soil and (2) dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) and total Kjeldahl phosphorus (TKP) in runoff water. STR included rotational grazing, excluding erosion vulnerable areas, and cattle-lure management using movable equipment (hay-rings, shades, and waterers). After three years of treatment, M1P had significantly accrued 6- and 5-fold in the 0-5 cm soil layer and by 2- and 1.6-fold in the 5-10 cm layer for CHD and STR, respectively, compared to Baseline M1P. In STR exclusions, M1P also increased to 10 cm depth post-treatment compared to Baseline. During Post-Treatment, TKP runoff concentrations were 21% and 29% lower, for CHD and STR, respectively, in 2018 compared to 2015. Hot Spot Analysis, a spatial clustering tool that utilizes Getis-Ord Gi* statistic, revealed no change in Post-Treatment CHD pastures, while hotspots in STR pastures had moved from low-lying to high-lying areas. Exclusion vegetation retained P and reduced bulk density facilitating vertical transportation of P deeper into the soil, ergo, soil P was less vulnerable to export in runoff, retained in the soil for forage utilization and reduced export of P to aquatic systems

AB  - Soil-water-climate-vegetation interactions jointly determine the ability of landscapes to provide ecosystem functions and services. In particular, spatio-temporal patterns in soil moisture underpin landscape ecohydrology. Though these patterns have been of interest to researchers for some time, there is new interest in the topic today as city managers engineer green infrastructure (GI) into urban landscapes. This paper presents soil moisture data collected from 2012 to 2014, and weighing lysimeter observations continuing through 2016, in two urban GI systems. Relationships between precipitation history, season, soil depth, hydraulic loading ratio (HLR) on the frequency and magnitude of soil moisture responses are described quantitatively. A logistic regression model is used to quantify the odds that each of these variables triggers a detectable soil moisture response. The results suggest that the higher HLR site (Site 2, HLR = 3.8) had 129.7% higher odds of a soil moisture response than Site 1 (HLR = 1). The results also indicate that there are 82.9% lower odds of a response in summer than in winter. Moreover, the odds of a response decrease with increasing soil depth. The linkage between GI siting and design decisions that impact soil moisture and ecosystem services is illustrated by also reporting evapotranspiration (ET) rates at the sites as determined by the lysimeter. Higher ET observed during wetter conditions supports the hypothesis that GI siting and design factors that lead to higher moisture content can engender greater ecosystem services associated with this hydrologic process. Indeed, the higher HLR of Site 2 sustained higher soil moisture levels during the summer compared to Site 1.

AB  - Water is a prerequisite for the formation of earth-biochemical-ecological systems. Differences in the spatial and temporal distribution of water resources are important factors in the formation of differences in the distribution of vegetation in terrestrial ecosystems and are key to the differences in vegetation productivity. Vegetation water use efficiency is calculated by the total amount of fixed biogenic carbon per unit mass of water consumed in photosynthesis and can be used to assess the intensity and capacity of an ecosystem to use water biomass. Based on remote satellite sensing data, this study proposes a new water use efficiency assessment model. The model was validated using flux site data, and we analyzed the relative contribution of climate factors to soil moisture use efficiency using a first-difference method. The results revealed the following: (1) The soil moisture use efficiencies (SUE) of remote sensing data inversions that were evaluated using flux site data based on correlation coefficients and Nash coefficients showed high reliability, and only the NMG (Inner Mongolia) station showed low correlation among the nine sites. (2) Among the nine agricultural sub-regions in China, only the SUE of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau region showed a decreasing trend (-1.08 g C/m- 2 kg H2O yr), while all other regions showed an increasing trend. (3) The highest vegetation soil moisture use efficiency (1.83 g C/m- 2 kg H2O) was found in ferralisols, while the lowest vegetation SUE (0.17 g C/m- 2 kg H2O) was found in arid soils. The SUE of different vegetation types showed the characteristics of forest > scrub > cultivated vegetation > wetland > grassland. (4) The relative contribution of gross primary productivity (GPP) to the change in SUE was 37.53%, while the relative contribution of soil moisture content to the change in SUE was -26.71%. Among the five climatic factors, temperature was the most dominant factor affecting the change in SUE, followed by precipitation, net radiation, leaf area index, and potential evapotranspiration. Revealing the relationship between terrestrial ecosystem GPP, soil moisture content, and their responses to climate factors is a prerequisite for understanding the adaptation strategies of regional terrestrial ecosystems to global climate change, which can help to inform decision-making for the sustainable development of ecosystems.

AB  - Background The use of soil phosphorus (P) tests and index systems provides a guide for agronomic nutrient requirements and is frequently also used to estimate risk of P losses to watercourses. Use of soil testing and management based on the results thereof is mandated in some regions. Several P extraction methods are available which evaluate different P pools and are designed for particular soil types. Further to this, index systems categorising specific ranges of plant-available P, differ. Hence, translation between different tests and index systems is not straightforward. In cross-border regions, where hydrologic basins encompass more than one political jurisdiction, different tests and rules are implemented in adjacent lands. This can create disparities in land management, confusion as to what legislation applies and obscures the impacts of best management practices at catchment scale. Aims The aim of this research was to compare the Morgan's and Olsen soil tests used to quantify plant-available P and the respective index systems, in a border region of the Republic of Ireland (ROI) - Northern Ireland (NI). Methods Olsen, Morgans and water extractable P (WEP) were evaluated (n = 1,038). Statistical analysis was conducted to derive conversion equations to translate between the statutory test methods and comparison of the respective index categories was performed. Results The conversion equations compared favourably with previous attempts. A stronger relationship was observed between Morgan P and WEP (R-2 = 0.60) than between Olsen P and WEP (R-2 = 0.45) (including pH and site as interaction factors). The ROI index system was found to indicate lower levels of plant available P in the soil compared to the NI system, for the same soils. Conclusions The differences in categorisation of P availability using either index system creates differences in fertiliser recommendations and also perceived aquatic risks even within small cross-border catchments. This study points to a wider implication for international cross-border catchments, suggesting that evaluation of the relationships between adjacent national soil index systems is required to achieve harmonised management of shared waterbodies. Neither index system is preferred, but a combination of soil P tests incorporating both agronomic and environmentally oriented analyses may have utility in future decision support tools.

AB  - Conventional high-input farming systems in Europe are often regarded as unsustainable with severe environmental impacts on biodiversity, soils, water and climate. Low-input farming approaches, such as organic farming, have been proposed to reduce environmental impacts while further improving soil properties such as soil organic matter content and aggregate stability. Whether these changes also influence ecohydrological properties and improve the water relations of organically grown crops remains unclear. In this study we assessed the long-term effects of conventional and organic farming systems on the water relations of soils and crops in the "DOK" (bioDynamic, bio-Organic & 'Konventionell' = conventional) trial. In particular, we tested if organic and conventional farming lead to marked differences in soil moisture, soil water evaporation, as well as root water uptake depth and stomatal conductance of winter wheat and soybean during the growing seasons 2017 and 2018. Stable isotope analyses and ecophysiological measurements revealed that organic compared to conventional farming did not affect soil water evaporation or root water uptake depths. Instead, we found higher soil moisture in the rooting zone and reduced stomatal conductance (gs) in organically grown wheat. Treatment effects on soil moisture and gs of soybean were smaller but showed similar tendencies as observed in wheat. Also, leaf area, and grain and straw yield of wheat decreased under organic farming while yields of soybean were not affected by the treatments. Based on our data we suggest that reduced plant water use observed under organically managed farming lead to the observed higher soil moisture in organically compared to conventionally managed farming systems in the DOK trial. These results suggest advantages of organic farming regarding agronomic water use as well as for the resistance of farming systems to current or future drought scenarios.

AB  - Accumulation of inorganic and labile organic phosphorus (P) in intensive agricultural systems leads to P loss from soil which can cause serious environmental problems. Soil microbes are important in mobilizing soil non-available P, however, little is known about the role of soil microbes in immobilizing P to reduce P loss. Here, we test whether stimulating microbial biomass to immobilize P could reduce the amount of labile P available for leaching. The distribution characteristics of Olsen P, organic P and microbial biomass P were determined in three intensive agricultural systems. In addition, we conducted a pot experiment with three P and four carbon (C) levels. CaCl2 extractable P was measured and used to indicate the risk of P leaching. We found that there was a positive relationship between soil organic C and microbial biomass P. Carbon addition drove the process of P immobilization and reduced CaCl2 extractable P. Microbial biomass P increased by 64% (p < .05) with the addition of C, and Olsen P and CaCl2 extractable P decreased by 28% and 17%, respectively. Our results show that C addition increased microbial immobilization of P and reduced forms of labile P susceptible to leaching. Stimulating microbes to immobilize P by adding C to soils may have the potential to reduce P loss from intensive agricultural systems, reducing their environmental impact.

AB  - To minimize purchased inputs, sustainable agriculture systems often use green- or animal-manure as a nitrogen source for crops. The addition of these materials also have positive impacts on soil phosphorus (P) availability. This study was conducted to investigate the effects of animal- and legume-based cropping systems in place for 5-13 years on the chemistry of organic matter and soil R Two cropping systems, Potato Ecosystem (ECO) located in Presque Isle, ME, U.S.A. and Grass Fertility (GF) located in Stillwater, ME, U.S.A. received animal manure. Two others, Liebman E Rotation (LER) in Stillwater, ME, U.S.A. and Porter Rotation (PR) in Presque Isle, ME, U.S.A. were primarily legume-based rotations. Estimated difference in carbon input (ha(-1) year(-1)) between the amended and control plots were: ECO, 8 100 kg C; GF, 1010 kg; LER, 950 kg C; and PR, 415 kg C. The dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was higher (P < 0.10) in the treatment that received animal manure than those which only received legume residue. The E2/E3 spectrophotometric test indicated that the DOC extracted from the ECO manure-treated plots was more humified than that from the ECO control plots. There were no significant differences between the amended and control treatments in Olsen P or total P for all the tested cropping systems. Similar to that of the DOC response, the ECO cropping system that received animal manure recorded higher concentrations of water soluble P (P < 0.05). There was a linear relationship between DOC and water-soluble P concentrations of the soil:water extract across soils, indicating a positive relationship between them. To determine the effects of the different cropping systems on P bioavailability, a simulation model was used to study how changes in P soil chemistry may affect P uptake by crops. The simulation runs showed that predicted P uptake was greater for the animal manure based ECO and GF systems, but not for the legume based LER and PR systems (P < 0.05). This study shows that cropping systems that include animal manure may increase soil P availability. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The tillage systems affect the amount of crop residue on the soil surface, and hence its temperature and moisture content. To evaluate the variation of moisture content and soil temperature in systems of tillage on maize growth stages, an experiment was conducted in Ultisol. The experiment was conducted with randomized complete block with four replications in Petrolina - PE, Brazil. The treatments consisted of five tillage systems applied to the plots - unprepared primary, off-set disc harrow of 0.56 m, off-set disc harrow of 0.61 m, chisel plow and moldboard plow. The soil moisture and temperature readings were taken at 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 h for the different maize stages V3, V8, R3 and R6. Soil moisture was measured in the layer between 0.00-0.05 m by means of deformed samples by using gravimetric method and soil temperature at the surface with infrared thermometer. Systems of soil tillage and hours of reading influenced the moisture and soil temperature. The highest values of soil moisture content occur in the morning, while the highest temperature of the soil in the afternoon.

AB  - The development of new methodologies and tools that enable to determine the water content in soil is of fundamental importance to the practice of irrigation. The objective of this study was to evaluate soil matric potential using mercury tensiometer and puncture digital tensiometer, and to compare the gravimetric soil moisture values obtained by tensiometric system with gravimetric soil moisture obtained by neutron attenuation technique. Four experimental plots were maintained with different soil moisture by irrigation. Three repetitions of each type of tensiometer were installed at 0.20 m depth. Based on the soil matric potential and the soil water retention curve, the corresponding gravimetric soil moisture was determined. The data was then compared to those obtained by neutron attenuation technique. The results showed that both tensiometric methods showed no difference under soil matric potential higher than -40 kPa. However, under drier soil, when the water was replaced by irrigation, the soil matric potential of the puncture digital tensiometer was less than those of the mercury tensiometer.

AB  - This paper presents some of the results and experiences in monitoring the hydraulic response of downscaled slope models under simulated rainfall in 1 g. The downscaled slope model platform was developed as part of a four-year research project, "Physical modeling of landslide remediation constructions' behavior under static and seismic actions", and its main components are briefly described with the particular focus on the sensor network that allows monitoring changes in soil moisture and pore-water pressure (pwp). The technical characteristics of the sensors and the measurement methods used to provide the metrics are described in detail. Some data on the hydraulic and mechanical responses obtained from the conducted tests on slope models built from different soil types under different test conditions are presented and interpreted in the context of rainfall-induced landslides. The results show that the sensor network used is suitable for monitoring changes in the soil moisture and pwp in the model, both in terms of the transient rainfall infiltration through partially saturated soil and in terms of the rise in the water table and pwp build-up under fully saturated conditions. It is shown how simultaneous monitoring of soil moisture and pwp can be used to reconstruct stress paths that the monitored points undergo during different test phases. Finally, some peculiarities related to hydraulic hysteresis and surface erosion that were observed in some of tests are discussed, as well as possible difficulties in achieving and maintaining the targeted initial moisture distribution in slope models.

AB  - In this work, we authors report the investigation of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) modified poly(3,4-ethylene-dioxythiophene)-poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT-PSS): titanium dioxide (TiO2) nanocomposite sensors towards relative humidity and soil moisture measurements at room temperature for agricultural applications. The morphological and structural features of the nanocomposite films were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy (FTIR) and theromogravimetric analysis (TGA). These characterizations reveal the successful formation of nanocomposite structures with improved thermal stability. The conductivity of nanocomposite film shows significant improvement compared to pure PEDOT-PSS by three orders of magnitude. Sensitive layer of PEDOT-PSS:PVA doped TiO(2)thin films were fabricated on ITO substrate using the spin coating technique to study relative humidity and soil moisture response. The nanocomposite film was subjected to varying levels of relative humidity (%RH) ranging from 5 to 95% and varied moisture content in soils of Montmorillonite and Kaolinite at room temperature. The resistance was found to decrease with increasing RH and gravimetric moisture content in Montmorillonite and Kaolinite soils. The humidity sensing response of PEDOT-PSS: PVA doped TiO2(8 wt%) composite thin film shows higher sensitivity of 96% with fast response and recovery times of 10 and 50 s respectively. Further, the sensitivities of 10.5 and 8.32 k ohm with 0.2% variation in gravimetric water content were achieved upon exposure of the prepared sensor to red and black soils respectively. Due to being relatively inexpensive, simple fabrication technique, excellent sensitivity, good repeatability and reproducibility these PVA modified PEDOT-PSS: TiO(2)nanocomposites sensors could be potentially useful in quantification of soil moisture content and relative humidity for agricultural applications.

AB  - This letter summarizes a special stream of the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters devoted to understanding the heterogeneity in soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and other related ecohydrological variables based on multiscale observations from satellite-based and airborne remote sensors, a flux observation matrix, and an ecohydrological wireless sensor network in the Heihe Watershed Allied Telemetry Experimental Research project. Scaling and uncertainty are the key issues in the remote-sensing research community, especially regarding the heterogeneous land surface. However, a lack of understanding and an inadequate theoretical basis impede the development and innovation of forward radiative transfer models, as well as the quantitative retrieval and validation of remote-sensing products. We summarize the prior considerations regarding surface heterogeneity research and report the main outcomes and contributions of this special stream. The highlights of this stream are related to spatial sampling, upscaling, uncertainty analysis, the validation of remote-sensing products, and accounting for heterogeneity in remote-sensing models.

AB  - In situ soil moisture monitoring networks are critical to the development of soil moisture remote sensing missions as well as agricultural and environmental management, weather forecasting, and many other endeavors. These in situ networks utilize a variety of sensors and installation practices, which confounds the development of a unified reference database for satellite calibration and validation programs. As part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission, the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST) was initiated to perform inter-comparisons and study sensor limitations. Soil moisture sensors that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600 m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM, Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system. In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an RMSE below 0.04 m(3) m(-3). For most sensor types, a single near surface sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0.03 m(3) m(-3).

AB  - Knowledge of spatial distributions of soil moisture, particularly at large spatial scales, is critical for many practical reasons. Unlike point-scale measurements, remote sensing provides an efficient way to estimate soil moisture over large areas. By resampling MODIS images with different scaling techniques, the impacts of those scaling methods on accuracy of soil moisture retrieval from MODIS data was first investigated using in situ soil moisture measurements. A soil moisture retrieval model was then constructed to obtain and analyse the spatial pattern of soil moisture in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous region of China in 2007. The following results were obtained. (1) With the process of spatial scale increases, the value of goodness-of-fit of the model change is relatively large, showing a strong randomness. (2) With resampling scales for 2 and 4 km when compared with measured data, correlation coefficient showed apparent fluctuation. With increased scale sampling, random changes in the model appeared to fluctuate less. Comparison of six different scaling methods, the results indicated that soil moisture retrieval model showed better correlation and higher accuracy of fitting under the scaling method of 2 km, respectively, followed by 1 and 16 km. (3) In order to test the accuracy of the retrieval model, the distribution of soil moisture was analysed by using of satellite image of the study area and retrieval of in situ soil moisture data, the data demonstrated high consistency with fieldwork. Evidence thus indicates that 2 km x 2 km is a significant level for retrieval distribution of soil moisture in the study area. The results also provide some reference for land-use planning and policy-making of sustainable utilisation of land resources.

AB  - This research is the first attempt to extensively assess the accuracy of commonly used surface and subsurface soil moisture (SM) datasets in reproducing temporal dynamics and trend changes SM observations for a long period on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). To this end, 12 satellite-based and 10 model-based SM products are evaluated using a 10-year upscaled SM dataset obtained from two in situ monitoring networks situated respectively in humid and arid climate zones over the TP. Moreover, the ability of using the outperforming satellite-based surface SM data in combination with cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching and exponential filter (ExpF) methods to improve model-based SM profile estimations is investigated for the first time. Among the 12 satellite-based products, SMAP_L3 provides the best surface SM retrievals, with the DCA and SCA-V products showing superior performance in the humid and arid areas, respectively. Consequently, the harmonized products produced based on the SMAP data (i.e., SMOSMAP and NNsm) also give relatively higher accuracy. It is surprised to find that the latest version of both CCI passive and active products presents degraded performance compared to its predecessor (i.e. v5.3). Among the 10 model-based products, SMAP_L4 with assimilation of L-band brightness temperature (TB) measurements provides relatively better estimations of surface and subsurface SM on the TP. Above findings highlight the superiority of utilizing the L-band TB measurements especially from the SMAP satellite to generate surface SM and improve the model-based SM estimations via data assimilation. Alternatively, it is further demonstrated that incorporating surface SM data from SMAP_L3, in conjunction with both CDF matching and ExpF methods, significantly enhances the precision of model-based SM estimations. This may open up a new possibility for improving the model-based SM profile data across the TP.

AB  - Soil moisture is a key terrain variable in ground vehicle off-road mobility. Historically, models of the land water balance have been used to estimate soil moisture. Recently, satellites have provided another source of soil moisture estimates that can be used to estimate soil-limited vehicle mobility. In this study, we compared the off-road vehicle mobility estimates based on three soil moisture sources: WindSat (a satellite source), LIS (a computer model source), and in situ ground sensors (to represent ground truth). Mobility of six vehicles; each with different ranges of sensitivity to soil moisture, was examined in three test sites. The results demonstrated that the effect of the soil moisture error on mobility predictions is complex and may produce very significant errors in off-road mobility analysis for certain combinations of vehicles, seasons, and climates. This is because soil moisture biases vary in both direction and magnitude with season and location. Furthermore, vehicles are sensitive to different ranges of soil moistures. Modeled vehicle speeds in the dry time periods were limited by the interaction between soil traction and the vehicles' powertrain characteristics. In the wet season, differences in soil strength resulted in more significant differences in mobility predictions. (C) 2016 ISTVS. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Obtaining large-scale, long-term, and spatial continuous soil moisture (SM) data is crucial for climate change, hydrology, and water resource management, etc. ESA CCI SM is such a large-scale and long-term SM (longer than 40 years until now). However, there exist data gaps, especially for the area of China, due to the limitations in remote sensing of SM such as complex topography, human-induced radio frequency interference (RFI), and vegetation disturbances, etc. The data gaps make the CCI SM data cannot achieve spatial continuity, which entails the study of gap-filling methods. In order to develop suitable methods to fill the gaps of CCI SM in the whole area of China, we compared typical Machine Learning (ML) methods, including Random Forest method (RF), Feedforward Neural Network method (FNN), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) with a geostatistical method, i.e., Ordinary Kriging (OK) in this study. More than 30 years of passive-active combined CCI SM from 1982 to 2018 and other biophysical variables such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), precipitation, air temperature, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), soil type, and in situ SM from International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) were utilized in this study. Results indicated that: (1) the data gap of CCI SM is frequent in China, which is found not only in cold seasons and areas but also in warm seasons and areas. The ratio of gap pixel numbers to the whole pixel numbers can be greater than 80%, and its average is around 40%. (2) ML methods can fill the gaps of CCI SM all up. Among the ML methods, RF had the best performance in fitting the relationship between CCI SM and biophysical variables. (3) Over simulated gap areas, RF had a comparable performance with OK, and they outperformed the FNN and GLM methods greatly. (4) Over in situ SM networks, RF achieved better performance than the OK method. (5) We also explored various strategies for gap-filling CCI SM. Results demonstrated that the strategy of constructing a monthly model with one RF for simulating monthly average SM and another RF for simulating monthly SM disturbance achieved the best performance. Such strategy combining with the ML method such as the RF is suggested in this study for filling the gaps of CCI SM in China.

AB  - The European Space Agency's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 soil moisture and the new L3 product from the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC) were validated from January 2010 to June 2014 using two in situ networks in Spain. The first network is the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network of the University of Salamanca (REMEDHUS), which has been extensively used for validating remotely sensed observations of soil moisture. REMEDHUS can be considered a small-scale network that covers a 1300 km(2) region. The second network is a large-scale network that covers the main part of the Duero Basin (65,000 km(2)). At an existing meteorological network in the Castilla y Leon region (Inforiego), soil moisture probes were installed in 2012 to provide data until 2014. Comparisons of the temporal series using different strategies (total average, land use, and soil type) as well as using the collocated data at each location were performed. Additionally, spatial correlations on each date were computed for specific days. Finally, an improved version of the Triple Collocation (TC) method, i.e., the Extended Triple Collocation (ETC), was used to compare satellite and in situ soil moisture estimates with outputs of the Soil Water Balance Model Green-Ampt (SWBM-GA). The results of this work showed that SMOS estimates were consistent with in situ measurements in the time series comparisons, with Pearson correlation coefficients (R) and an Agreement Index (AI) higher than 0.8 for the total average and the land-use averages and higher than 0.85 for the soil-texture averages. The results obtained at the Inforiego network showed slightly better results than REMEDHUS, which may be related to the larger scale of the former network. Moreover, the best results were obtained when all networks were jointly considered. In contrast, the spatial matching produced worse results for all the cases studied.
   These results showed that the recent reprocessing of the L2 products (v5.51) improved the accuracy of soil moisture retrievals such that they are now suitable for developing new L3 products, such as the presented in this work. Additionally, the validation based on comparisons between dense/sparse networks and satellite retrievals at a coarse resolution showed that temporal patterns in the soil moisture are better reproduced than spatial patterns.

AB  - Infiltration-based urban stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are widely used for the reduction of runoff volumes and improvement of runoff quality. In this paper, closed-form analytical equations, collectively referred to as the analytical stormwater models (ASMs), are derived for analyzing the dynamic water balance of infiltration-based BMPs. For simplicity, previously developed ASMs only considered vertical infiltrations through the bottoms of infiltration-based BMPs although lateral infiltrations are not negligible and can even be the predominant ones in some real cases. To overcome this limitation, the ASMs developed in this study take into account infiltrations through the sides and the bottoms of BMPs. The concept of effective storage capacity is also proposed and used in this study to reduce the discrepancies caused by representing rainfall inputs as instantaneous pulses. Using infiltration trench as an example, the acceptability of the simplifying assumptions based on which the ASMs are derived is demonstrated by comparing ASMs' results with those from numerical simulations which do not require the same simplifying assumptions. The effects of many influencing factors on the hydrologic performance of infiltrations trenches are also illustrated. The ASMs are recommended as a computationally efficient alternative for use in the planning, design, and analysis of infiltration-based BMPs.

AB  - Study region: Italy and in particular the provinces of Verona and Foggia.Study focus: The assessment of drought impacts at local scale requires adequately detailed spatiotemporal estimates of drought severity. Given the intrinsic uncertainty in drought severity estimates based on a single index, especially at high spatial resolution, the use of combined indices is preferable. However, the disagreement between the single indices needs to be addressed. We propose a methodology to combine the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index and the Soil Moisture Anomalies based on a double-entry matrix. The classification adopted to define five semi-quantitative severity classes is generalized by introducing an objective approach to assign values when the two base indices disagree. The methodology is tuned over two Italian provinces, Verona and Foggia, with focus on agricultural drought at the high spatial detail of single municipalities.New hydrological insights for the region: The methodology is proved to be skillful (Heidke Skill Score of 0.75) in capturing the spatio-temporal evolution of the major agricultural droughts observed in the two case study regions (2012, 2015 and 2017), which are benchmarked using data from drought impact databases. The temporal dynamics modeled by this index align with the timeline of the drought events, suggesting that the index is suitable for near-real time agricultural drought monitoring. The simplicity of the double-entry matrix approach allows for upscaling to the entire country.

AB  - Cropping practices interactively affect soil P status. Previous studies mostly focused on cropping practices individually and limited assessments within the plow layer. This study assessed the P status of a Labarre silty clay (Humic Gleysol) profile after 10 yr cultivation under contrasting practices. Soils of 0-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-90 cm layers were sampled from a split-plot experiment comprising barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) monoculture and a 3-yr barley-red clover-timothy rotation both tilled with either chisel or moldboard plow as main plots, and receiving fertilizer P or liquid dairy manure as subplots. A modified Hedley sequential fractionation was used to characterize soil P status. Labile P pools were more affected than stable ones by cropping practices. The P fractions depended more on nutrient sources than cropping systems in the 0- to 30-cm soil layer, whereas the impacts were predominated by cropping systems in the subsoil. Compared to the manure, fertilizer P resulted in higher contents of Mehlich III extractable P, resin-P, NaHCO3-P-i and NaOH-P-i, and lower contents of NaHCO3-P-o, NaOH-P-o and H2SO4-P in the 0- to 30-cm layers. The rotation produced larger labile P fractions than the monoculture in the 30- to 60-cm layer. The impacts of the investigated cropping practices on labile P fractions extended deeper in the soil profile than the depth disturbed by primary tillage. Crop sequence, primary tillage and nutrient source had large effects on P status in the soil profile, of this clayey and poorly drained soil.

AB  - A large variety of extraction methods are used worldwide for the estimation of "plant-available P" in soils. In Germany, the standard extractants are Calcium-Acetate-Lactate (CAL) and Double-Lactate (DL). Until now there is no validated transformation procedure available and studies on the comparability of both methods have reported conflicting evidence. The uncertainty about the equivalence of CAL-P and DL-P hinders a direct comparison of the P fertility status and P fertilizer recommendations across Germany. Based on 136 datasets for soil samples from an interlaboratory comparison program and three P fertilization field trial sites, for which plant-available P had been determined by both the CAL and DL method, we assessed the comparability of both extraction methods and derived simple and multiple regression equations to transform DL-P into CAL-P values. On average, DL extracted 30% more P than CAL. However, this strongly depended on soil pH and carbonate content. A simple linear regression model explained 70% of the variance. However, if simple linear regression models were fitted to pH-specific samples (pH range 4.5 to 7.0) the R-2 increased to 0.96. Based on an independent validation dataset (n = 48) we demonstrated that such pH-specific models were more accurate than models that did not consider pH when transforming DL-P to CAL-P values. Multiple regression results showed that out of soil pH, C-org, N-t, and C : N ratio, only soil pH improved the model. The transformation equations in this study provide a step towards an improved comparability of P fertility status assessments of soils across Germany.

AB  - To examine the effects of winter wheat genotypes on dry matter (DM) accumulation and grain yield (GY) under no-tillage conditions in North China Plain (NCP), a field experiment was conducted using the genotypes Tainong 18 (F) and Jimai 22 (J). Two tillage systems were tested, conventional tillage (CT) and no-tillage (NT) during the 2015/2016 and 2016/2017 winter wheat growing seasons. Genotypes and tillage systems were compared regarding DM accumulation, GY, leaf area index (LAI), photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) interception, and flag leaf fluorescence parameters. LAI, PAR interceptions, and flag leaf fluorescence parameters were significantly higher under CT than under NT conditions. This suggests that the efficiency of light harvesting by the PSII reaction center of leaves can increase due to CT. DM accumulation was significantly higher under CT than under NT. Spike DM accumulation was higher in F than in J in the heading and the filling stages. In both growing seasons, GY was significantly higher under CT than under NT, GY of NTF was significantly higher than that of NTJ, which was due to a significantly higher number of kernels per spike. This indicates that genotype F can compensate for a low GY due to NT.

AB  - Citrus (Citrus sp.) root length density (RLD) can help in understanding and predicting nutrient and water uptake dynamics. A study was conducted at two sites in Florida to investigate root and water distribution patterns among different irrigation and fertigation systems. The results over the 2 years showed that RLD was highest in the 0- to 15-cm soil depth and decreased with depth for all treatments at both sites. About 64% to 82% of the fibrous roots (<1 mm diameter) were concentrated in the irrigated zones of drip- and microsprinkler-irrigated trees and 18% to 36% were found in the nonirrigated zones at the Spodosol site (SS). At the Entisol site (ES), the RLD (<0.5 mm diameter) in the 0- to 15-cm depth soil for intensive microsprinkler or drip irrigation was 3- to 4-fold (nonirrigated zone) and 4- to 7-fold (irrigated zone) greater at the 0- to 15-cm soil depth than that for conventional irrigation system. The trees at SS were symptomatic for Huanglongbing (HLB; Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus) in the second year, while those at ES were asymptomatic throughout the study. This might have limited the density and extent of root distribution at SS. The water contents remained either close to or slightly above the field capacity. The results showed higher RLD for intensive irrigation and fertigation practices in irrigated zones compared with conventional grower applications suggesting greater water and nutrient uptake potential for the former.

AB  - We investigate the potential of causal inference methods (CIMs) to reveal hydrological connections from time series. Four CIMs are selected from two criteria, linear or nonlinear and bivariate or multivariate. A priori, multivariate, and nonlinear CIMs are best suited for revealing hydrological connections because they fit nonlinear processes and deal with confounding factors such as rainfall, evapotranspiration, or seasonality. The four methods are applied to a synthetic case and a real karstic case study. The synthetic experiment confirms our expectation: unlike the other methods, the multivariate nonlinear framework has a low false-positive rate and allows for ruling out a connection between two disconnected reservoirs forced with similar effective precipitation. However, for the real case study, the multivariate nonlinear method was unstable because of the uneven distribution of missing values affecting the final sample size for the multivariate analyses, forcing us to cope with the results' robustness. Nevertheless, if we recommend a nonlinear multivariate framework to reveal actual hydrological connections, all CIMs bring valuable insights into the system's dynamics, making them a cost-effective and recommendable comparative tool for exploring data. Still, causal inference remains attached to subjective choices, operational constraints, and hypotheses challenging to test. As a result, the robustness of the conclusions that the CIMs can draw always deserves caution, especially with real, imperfect, and limited data. Therefore, alongside research perspectives, we encourage a flexible, informed, and limit-aware use of CIMs without omitting any other approach that aims at the causal understanding of a system.

AB  - Changes in land use alter the natural cycling of phosphorus (P) in soil. Understanding the chemical nature of these changes is important when developing sustainable management practices for cultivated soils. In this study, we evaluated the ability of commonly used laboratory methods to characterize land use-induced changes in various P pools. Also, the characteristics of soil P revealed by different methods are discussed. Soil samples were taken from three differently managed field plots of the same clay soil: uncultivated grassland and organic and conventional crop rotations. Soil P reserves were characterized using Chang and Jackson and Hedley sequential fractionation procedures and by sodium hydroxide (NaOH)-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) extraction followed by P-31 NMR spectroscopy. Both of the tested fractionation methods identified differences in the P pools and provided evidence regarding land use-induced changes. However, the P-31 NMR analysis suggests that the quality of organic P in this soil was not affected by the change in land use.

AB  - Earth Observation (EO) technologies have played an increasingly important role in monitoring the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). These technologies often combined with Machine Learning (ML) models provide efficient means for achieving the SDGs. The great progress of this combination is also demonstrated by the large number of software, web tools and packages that have been made available for free use. In this paper, we introduce a software architecture to facilitate the generation of EO information targeted towards soil moisture that derive several challenges regarding the facilitation of satellite data processing. Thus, this paper presents a web-based tool for Soil Moisture Estimation (SMETool), designed for the soil moisture estimation using Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-2A data based on Eo-learn library. SMETool implements several ML techniques such as (Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), etc.). The SMETool could be very useful for decision makers in the region in assessing the effects of drought and desertification events. Experiments were carried out on two sites in Tunisia during the period from 2016 to 2017. Although the performance of the used models is very close, it is clear that CNN and RF outperformed other ML models. The achieved results reveal that the soil moisture, was highly correlated to the in-situ measurements with high Pearson's correlation coefficient r (rRF = 0.86, rANN = 0.75, rXGBoost = 0.79, rCNN = 0.87) and low Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (RMSERF = 1.09%, RMSEANN = 1.49%, RMSEXGBoost = 1.39%, RMSECNN = 1.12%), respectively.

AB  - The effects of organic (manure, cover crop) and mineral fertilisers on total yield, soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) dynamics and soil pH changes were studied over 10 years. Five field crops (spring barley, red clover, winter wheat, field pea, potato) were grown organically and conventionally in rotation. The total yield of the five crops fertilized similarly was 24-25% higher in conventionally fertilised treatments than in organic treatments. The higher yielding conventionally fertilised treatments (annual total yield 29.0-29.8 t ha(-1)) removed 12-18 kg ha(-1) P and 45-73 kg ha(-1) K per year, which was respectively 28-35% and 28-40% higher than organic treatments. The soil became more acidic in the conventional system (pH 5.4-5.9 versus 5.9-6.3). The highest annual P and K uptake was by potato, followed by winter wheat. Use of winter cover crops and composted cattle manure in the organic system did not maintain the levels of P and K in the soil at baseline.

KW  - SYSTEM
AB  - The increasing demand for irrigation water to secure food for growing populations with limited water supply suggests re-thinking the use of non-conventional water resources. The latter includes saline drainage water, brackish groundwater and treated waste water. The effects of using saline drainage water (electrical conductivity of 4.2-4.8 dS m(-1)) to irrigate field-grown tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill cv Floradade) using drip and furrow irrigation systems were evaluated, together with the distribution of soil moisture and salt. The saline water was either diluted to different salinity levels using fresh water (blended) or used cyclically with fresh water. The results of two seasons of study (2001 and 2002) showed that increasing salinity resulted in decreased leaf area index, plant dry weight, fruit total yield and individual fruit weight. In all cases, the growth parameters and yield as well as the water use efficiency were greater for drip irrigated tomato plants than furrow-irrigated plants. However, furrow irrigation produced higher individual fruit weight. The electrical conductivity of the soil solution (extracted 48 h after irrigation) showed greater fluctuations when cyclic water management was used compared to those plots irrigated with blended water. In both drip and furrow irrigation, measurements of soil moisture one day after irrigation, showed that soil moisture was higher at the top 20 cm layer and at the location of the irrigation water source; soil moisture was at a minimum in the root zone (20-40 cm layer), but showed a gradual increase at 40-60 and 60-90 cm and was stable at 90-120 cm depth. Soil water content decreased gradually as the distance from the irrigation water source increased. In addition, a few days after irrigation, the soil moisture content decreased, but the deficit was most pronounced in the surface layer. Soil salinity at the irrigation source was lower at a depth of 15 cm (surface layer) than that at 30 and 60 cm, and was minimal in deeper layers (i.e. 90 cm). Salinity increased as the distance from the irrigation source increased particularly in the surface layer. The results indicated that the salinity followed the water front. We concluded that the careful and efficient management of irrigation with saline water can leave the groundwater salinity levels unaffected and recommended the use of drip irrigation as the fruit yield per unit of water used was on average one-third higher than when using furrow irrigation.

AB  - Climate change is now affecting every known society. Small-scale farmers in low-income countries are especially vulnerable to climate change because they depend heavily on rain, seasonality patterns, and known temperature ranges. Prioritizing the efforts of building climate change resilience and adaptive capacity for small-scale farmers is essential in achieving Sustainable Development Goals 13, 1, and 2. An important first step towards those efforts is to assess the climate change vulnerability among the population. We propose a Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Framework Design Framework (CCVA-DF) to guide the design of innovative digital CCVA solutions to enhance the adaptive capacity and climate change resilience of small-scale farmers. The framework outlines modern methods for vulnerability data collection and processing through Remote Sensing and GIS, advanced spatial analysis and modeling for measuring vulnerabilities, and visual analytics to support decision-making in the planning and implementation of suitable interventions. The framework is instantiated into a web application that is used by a real-world organization for transforming household resilience in Western Honduras. The CCVA-DF showcases novel measures of vulnerability using geospatial technology. It provides guidelines to design digital vulnerability assessment tools that can be used by researchers and practitioners worldwide to tackle climate change challenges.

AB  - This research evaluated the potential benefits of winter cover crops on the utilization and cycling of P in Brazilian tropical cropping systems. The effect of P fertilizer [none, rock phosphate (RP), and soluble phosphate (single superphosphate, SSP)] in combination with cover crop residues (common vetch [Vicia sativa L.], white lupin [Lupinus albus L.], forage radish [Raphanus sativus L.], ryegrass [Lolium multiflorum Lam], black oat [Avena strigosa Schreb.], red clover [Trifolium pratense L.], and fallow) were evaluated on maize (Zea mays L.) yield and P use efficiency over three maize cropping seasons under no-tillage, from 2009 to 2012. Cover crop yields and P uptake were higher under phosphate fertilizers than nil-P across all seasons evaluated. The highest amounts of P recycled in cover crops over the period were under white lupin, followed by radish and ryegrass, but without any significant cover crop effect on maize yield. The largest response and greatest P use efficiency (30 kg grain per kg P applied) was obtained in the third year of evaluation, when maize yield was restricted by low rainfall. In this year, RP promoted greater maize yield than SSP and the nil-P. Soil available P at the end of the experiment was higher under RP than SSP. It is concluded that RP solubility is higher than currently predicted (9% P2O5 in citric acid). Cover crops were not able to affect maize yield aft er 3 yr of leaving the residues on the surface, however they can reduce the soil loss by erosion and runoff.

AB  - Ion-selective field-effect transistors (ISFETs) offer potential as micro-sensors for in situ monitoring of complex target variables in real-time closed loop actions. This article presents the concept and realisation of application-specific ISFET-based measurement systems for two different agricultural domains: infield soil measurements and hydroponic systems. Commercially available ISFETs were integrated as multi-sensor modules as well as single-sensor units for the measurement of plant-available nutrients, such as H2PO4-, NO3-, K+ or NH4+, and pH-values. Moreover, application-relevant pH values as well as temperatures for calibration purposes were measured. ISFETs were selected according to the relevant measurement dynamics for the applications. For the development and testing procedures, a laboratory setup was built up. Supported by reference materials, the outputs of the ISFETs were evaluated with respect to stability under the influence of disturbance variables, reproducibility and settling time. The results were used to develop new readout electronics. Next to stability, conditioning and calibration processes were relevant. The micro-sensors were integrated in new application-specific mechatronic handling systems and process flows. The realisation and tests are presented as well as first measurements in outdoor fields and indoor hydroponic environments.

AB  - Field studies have demonstrated that ground surface rainfall accumulation can be detected at depth by synchronous increases in static confined groundwater pore pressures. This opens the way for "geological weighing lysimeters" providing disturbance-free water storage monitoring of the surface environment, in effect by weighing a significant land area in real time. Such systems require specific hydrogeological conditions, which are not easily verified by field observations and replicated observations from multiple geological formations are a prerequisite for quality control. Given replication over two monitored formations, we introduce an expression which utilises the respective formation piezometric water levels to give an improved combined estimate of the ground surface water budget. The expression utilises raw piezometric levels and has the advantage of direct correction for Earth tide noise, which may sometimes be influenced by local effects in addition to the pure solar/lunar tidal potential. The expression is particularly simple, if the two formations have similar (but possibly unknown) undrained Poisson ratios and porosities. Surface water budgets can then be estimated using only the respective formation barometric coefficients and piezometric levels. An example application to two vertically separated confined aquifers at a New Zealand site indicate an improved accuracy over single-formation observations. The two-formation expression for surface storage could find use as an accurate water budget tool with particular application to monitoring diffuse hydrological systems such as wetlands, and regions, and heavily forested localities.

AB  - There are concerns related to the application of phosphate fertilizers to weathered soils that present low soil test phosphorus (STP) due to P adsorption in iron oxyhydroxides. Furthermore, long-term trials are needed to evaluate crop response to corrective P fertilization and its interaction with different maintenance P fertilization strategies in these soils. An experiment involving the combination of three initial corrective P fertilization schemes (control without P correction or with the application of 105 kg P ha(-1) as triple superphosphate [TSP] or reactive rock phosphate [RRP]), four P maintenance strategies (a control without the application of maintenance P, or 35 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) as TSP, RRP, or a mix of both) and two application methods was cultivated during 16 yr at the Embrapa Cerrados experimental station in Planaltina, DF, Brazil. Corrective P fertilization promoted an early crop yield response. In contrast, high crop yields were only obtained in control treatments with no corrective P fertilization after soil P stocks were increased to a minimum level. With increasing P stocks, broadcast application resulted in slightly better yields. The required residual P stocks in soil to obtain high yields were estimated as equivalent to 113.6 and 205.2 kg P ha(-1) for TSP and RRP, respectively. These values allow for STP contents to increase to critical levels, whose value for TSP of 4.1 mg kg(-1) Mehlich-1 P is below that recommended for the region, possibly due to the contribution of organic P forms in the long-term no-tillage system.

AB  - Goosegrass is considered one of the most important grassy weeds of rice, particularly in rain-fed environments. Experiments were conducted in laboratory, screenhouse, and field to study the germination ecology of goosegrass seeds. In the laboratory, germination was greater at higher alternating temperatures (30/20 and 35/25 C) than at the lowest alternating temperatures (25/15 C). An after-ripening period of at least 3 mo was required to improve the germination of goosegrass. Germination was tolerant of salt stress but sensitive to a high degree of water stress. A pH range of 5 to 10 did not influence seed germination (92 to 95%). In the screenhouse study, seedling emergence of goosegrass was greatest (82%) for seeds placed on the soil surface, but decreased exponentially after that, no seedlings emerged at a burial depth of 8 cm. Seedling emergence and seedling dry matter declined markedly with the addition of crop residue to the soil surface at rates equivalent to 4 to 6 ton (t) ha(-1). In the Field, seedling emergence of goosegrass was greater under zero-till (ZT; 16 to 18%) than under minimum tillage (MINT; 8 to 11%). Because seedling emergence was greater from surface-sown seeds and emergence was favored by ZT, this species is likely to become a problematic weed in ZT systems. The information gained from this study could be used in developing effective weed management strategies.

AB  - Traditional methods for studying tree roots are destructive and labor intensive, but available nondestructive techniques are applicable only to small scale studies or are strongly limited by soil conditions and root size. Soil electrical resistivity measured by geoelectrical methods has the potential to detect belowground plant structures, but quantitative relationships of these measurements with root traits have not been assessed. We tested the ability of two-dimensional (2-D) DC resistivity tomography to detect the spatial variability of roots and to quantify their biomass in a tree stand. A high-resolution resistivity tornogram was generated along a 11.75 m transect under an Alnus glutinosa (L.) Gaertn. stand based on an alpha-Wenner configuration with 48 electrodes spaced 0.25 m apart. Data were processed by a 2-D finite-element inversion algorithm, and corrected for soil temperature. Data acquisition, inversion and imaging were completed in the field within 60 min. Root dry mass per unit soil volume (root mass density, RMD) was measured destructively on soil samples collected to a depth of 1.05 m. Soil sand, silt, clay and organic matter contents, electrical conductivity, water content and pH were measured on a subset of samples. The spatial pattern of soil resistivity closely matched the spatial distribution of RMD. Multiple linear regression showed that only RMD and soil water content were related to soil resistivity along the transect. Regression analysis of RMD against soil resistivity revealed a highly significant logistic relationship (n = 97), which was confirmed on a separate dataset (n = 67), showing that soil resistivity was quantitatively related to belowground tree root biomass. This relationship provides a basis for developing quick nondestructive methods for detecting root distribution and quantifying root biomass, as well as for optimizing sampling strategies for studying root-driven phenomena.

AB  - Irrigation has a great impact on global food security as it contributes to the majority of the world's agricultural food supply. It is essential to judiciously utilize water resources through efficient irrigation management since the majority of U.S. groundwater aquifers are rapidly depleting. Thus, quantification of the relationships between water depletion and environmental factors is important for understanding crop response to varying levels of water stresses that depletion can cause. The objectives of this research were to: 1) investigate the relationship between root zone water depletion (D-rw) and canopy temperature differential (Delta T) at different ranges of D-rw; and 2) develop upper (water stressed) and lower (non-water stressed) baselines for quantification of crop water stress index (CWSI) in a sub-humid climate. The research was conducted over maize and soybean during 2018, 2019, and 2020 growing seasons. Sensor node stations comprising of an infrared thermometer and three soil water sensors were installed at various sites over maize and soybean fields. Delta T tends to increase with the increase in D-rw when the range of D-rw includes values greater than 170 mm for maize and values greater than 160 mm for soybean. The results indicate that Delta T and D-rw are unrelated until a soil-water depletion threshold is attained, and these D-rw threshold values could be considered as indicators to trigger irrigation for efficient agricultural water management. To the best of the authors' knowledge, the research is the first to develop upper and lower CWSI baselines for east-central Nebraska. The baselines developed in this study could facilitate the quantification of CWSI for irrigation scheduling of maize and soybean in east-Central Nebraska. Future work should aim to investigate the potential in using D-rw and/or Delta T to determine efficient water allocation and if a threshold CWSI could be used for timing of irrigation to prevent yield loss.

AB  - Irrigation is a service provided to agricultural crops in order to improve their yields. This is also a rare situation where the location of the costumers (roots) is not known and the heterogeneity in the water delivery system (soil) effects the water distribution. This non-uniformity of soil-plant conditions in the agricultural field complicates decision-making parameters regarding irrigation management (where to place sensors, how many sensors are needed, when and how much to irrigate). Many aspects of this non-uniformity have been studied in the past decades, including soil hydraulic properties, tillage history, irrigation method, sensor location, measured volume, and more. One aspect that has been relatively neglected is how plant roots affect variability. In this work, we focus on the effect that growing roots have on the variability of tensiometer measurements.
   Corn seeds were sown in a pre-designed experimental plot that consisted of three very distinct soils (sand, sandy loam, clay) to create high variation in investigated conditions. Subsurface drip irrigation was installed in the plot, and the drippers of the center line were wrapped with geotextile to create a geotextile-drip interface (GDI), i.e., a volume which has preferred conditions for root growth. Tensiometers were installed in the GDI (GDI treatment) and 10 cm away from the drip lines (S10 treatment); the matric head was monitored throughout the season.
   The weekly averaged coefficient of variation (CV) of the GDI treatment decreased as the corn plants grew, for each soil type and the entire plot. As time passed and the corn plants grew, CV peaks, due to irrigation, and the duration of high CV decreased because of the increasing influence of root water uptake on fluxes in the measured volume. After harvest, the CV returned to initial values. S10 tensiometers showed higher CV values than the GDI tensiometers during the last week of growth. After harvest, the CV of the S10 tensiometer measurements decreased, contrary to the trend in the GDI tensiometers. The results point to the major influence of roots on matric head variability, first, by decreasing variability with time and second, through the effect of tensiometer location since the GDI tensiometers were located in volumes with high root density. This influence has major consequences regarding the methodology of tensiometer measurements to represent an agricultural field, and might provide means for global guidelines for tensiometer placement and irrigation management.

AB  - Measuring biological net soil nitrogen mineralization (NSNM) can assist nitrogen (N) fertility management in agroecosystems, but the time and apparatus required for this assessment limits measurement frequency. Stable NSNM predictors that could be rapidly measured to compare systems would be extremely useful. We compared the effects of crop and soil management on NSNM from 2011 to 2013 and evaluated several carbon (C) and N indices including particulate organic carbon (POC), particulate organic nitrogen (PON), permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil total nitrogen (STN) as NSNM indicators. Soil (0 to 10 and 10 to 20 cm depths) was collected from six long-term burley tobacco (Nicotiana tobacum L.) tillage and rotation systems. Net soil nitrogen mineralization was estimated by a 120-d laboratory incubation. The relative effects of management on NSNM among these systems were stable across 3 yr, which suggested NSNM measurement can be reduced to that frequency when NSNM is used to compare different crop and soil management. The soil C and N fractions contributed variably to predicting soil N mineralization in the different rotation systems, but SOC (which can be calculated from soil organic matter, a common index in the routine test package of many soil testing laboratories) was the best overall NSNM predictor in this study.

AB  - Sustainable soil fertility management depends on long-term integrated strategies that build and maintain soil organic matter and mineralizable soil N levels. These strategies increase the portion of crop N needs met by soil N and reduce dependence on external N inputs required for crop production. To better understand the impact of management on soil N dynamics, we conducted field and laboratory research on five diverse management systems at a long-term study in Maryland, the USDA- Agricultural Research Service Beltsville Farming Systems Project (FSP). The FSP is comprised of a conventional no-till corn (Zea mays L.)-soybean (Glycine max L.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/double-crop soybean rotation (NT), a conventional chisel-till corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (CT), a 2 year organic corn-soybean rotation (Org2), a 3 year organic corn-soybean-wheat rotation (Org3), and a 6 year organic corn-soybean-wheat-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (3 years) rotation (Org6). We found that total potentially mineralizable N in organic systems (average 315 kg N ha(-1)) was significantly greater than the conventional systems (average 235 kg N ha(-1)). Particulate organic matter (POM)-C and -N also tended to be greater in organic than conventional cropping systems. Average corn yield and N uptake from unamended (minus N) field microplots were 40 and 48%, respectively, greater in organic than conventional grain cropping systems. Among the three organic systems, all measures of N availability tended to increase with increasing frequency of manure application and crop rotation length (Org2 < Org3 a parts per thousand currency sign Org6) while most measures were similar between NT and CT. Our results demonstrate that organic soil fertility management increases soil N availability by increasing labile soil organic matter. Relatively high levels of mineralizable soil N must be considered when developing soil fertility management plans for organic systems.

AB  - Precise measurements of the downward movement of precipitation through the unsaturated zone, as well as return flow of moisture to the atmosphere via evaporation, have always been challenging in regard to in-situ monitoring techniques. This study investigates the profile of volumetric water-content fluctuations within the unsaturated zone through a combination of field techniques, including in-situ measurements of the volumetric porewater content at different depths using specially designed time-domain reflectometry (TDR) probes. The probes are installed through direct-push vibro-coring methods, at significant depths within the unsaturated zone, providing continuous readings of the soil-moisture content throughout the unsaturated column. The measured waveform is analyzed by using the inverse modeling approach resulting in an apparent relative dielectric permittivity profile of the surrounding medium along the TDR probe length. The approach sufficiently analyzes the mechanisms of water fluxes through significant depths within the unsaturated zone, which in turn can be used to quantify groundwater recharge at areas where the unsaturated zone hydrology plays a key role in the recharge of the underlying aquifers (such as arid and hydrologically sensitive areas). The approach was applied at an experimental field site in the Upper Rhine Valley, Germany.

AB  - This study examines the effects of straw management and winter flooding on soil N dynamics and crop N uptake in California rice (Oryza sativa L.) systems. Experiments were established in two locations in northern California with main plot treatments being winter flooding or no flooding; and four straw management practices (burn, remove, incorporate, and roll) as subplot treatments. Fertilizer was applied to the plots at the recommended levels for each site, but within each plot a zero N microplot was established. Total straw inputs before winter flooding averaged 7000 kg ha(-1) for the incorporate and roll treatments, 4200 kg ha(-1) for the remove, and 1600 kg ha(-1) for the burn treatment (straw N ranged from 11 to 66 kg ha(-1)). Before flooding the field for planting, there was 9% less straw in winter flooded plots compared to nonflooded plots. Straw incorporation resulted in more rapid straw decomposition compared to other treatments where the straw was not incorporated. Furthermore, potentially mineralizable N and soil extractable N was higher in the winter flooded treatments and where rice straw was retained. Crop response varied between sites but our results suggest that N fertilizer recommendations could potentially be reduced by 20 kg ha(-1) if straw is incorporated and winter flooded.

AB  - The spatial mismatch of Cd content in soil and rice causes difficulties in environmental management for paddy soil. To investigate the influence of soil environment on the accumulation of Cd in rice grain, we conducted a paired field sampling in the middle of the Xiangjiang River basin, examining the relationships between soil properties, soil nutrient elements, Cd content, plant uptake factor (PUFCd), and translocation factors in different rice organs (root, shoot, and grain). The total soil Cd (CdT) and available Cd (CdA) contents and PUFCd showed large spatial variability with ranges of 0.31-6.19 mg/kg, 0.03-3.07 mg/kg, and 0.02-3.51, respectively. Soil pH, CdT, CdA, and the contents of soil nutrient elements (Mg, Mn, Ca, P, Si, and B) were linearly correlated with grain Cd content (Cdg) and PUFCd. The decision tree analysis identified nonlinear effects of Si, Zn and Fe on rice Cd accumulation, which suggested that low Si and high Zn led to high Cdg, and low Si and Fe caused high PUFCd. Using the soil nutrient elements as predictor variables, random forest models successfully predicted the Cdg and PUFCd and performed better than multiple linear regressions.

AB  - In recent years, continuous improvements have been made in weather forecasting and flood prediction with great benefit from Early Warning Systems (EWSs). Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the scientific and user communities, EWSs remain based mostly on hazard forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential impacts is generally missing.
   In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved.
   The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in northwestern Italy. This paper discusses the potential challenges and opportunities offered by this approach in the decision-making workflow in an operational context.

AB  - Global change will likely express itself in southwestern United States arid lands through changes in amounts and timing of precipitation in response to elevated CO2 concentrations. In addition, increased nitrogen (N) deposition may occur due to increased urban development. This study addressed the effects of water and N availability on C allocation in arid land soil-plant systems.
   Columns filled with Mojave Desert topsoil containing Larrea tridentata seedlings with two treatment levels each of N and soil moisture were labeled by exposure to C-13-enriched CO2.
   Increased soil moisture increased plant biomass, total C-13 uptake, C-13 levels in leaves, soil organic matter, and soil respiration, decreased relative C allocation to stems but increased allocation to soil organic matter. Increased soil N availability increased N uptake but decreased C allocation to soil respiration presumably due to decreased substrate supply for microbes. There was no detectable label in carbonate C, suggesting that this pool does not significantly contribute to ecosystem C fluxes.
   Our study indicates that increased water availability causes increased C uptake with increased C allocation to soil organic matter in Larrea tridentata-dominated communities while increased N deposition will have a minimal impact on C sequestration.

AB  - Non-ponded aerobic rice offers the opportunity for substantial global savings of irrigated water. Site and environment specific soil tension thresholds have been identified for non-ponded rice production to save water without adverse yield consequences. However, soil tension readings are point-source measures that are not necessarily representative of a given irrigation area/paddy and become costly when required in each paddy. Remote sensing offers spatial advantages and has been demonstrated in many crops to accurately estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is often used to schedule irrigation. This study uses soil moisture tension (SMT) data measured in a commercial aerobic rice experiment conducted in temperate Australia on a heavy clay soil to demonstrate the relationship between soil tension and remotely sensed estimated cumulative ETc between irrigation events using open access satellite imagery. The model was used to predict SMT in the second growing season during the vegetative period after establishment until PI with a root mean squared error of +/- 5.8 kPa. This demonstrates the ability of irrigators to schedule irrigation in water saving rice using open satellite-derived data that can be incorporated into an automated irrigation system, without the need for costly in-field soil moisture sensors. Future research to integrate forecast crop evapotranspiration could enable soil moisture forecasting days in advance, providing irrigators more time to plan irrigation activities.

AB  - Understanding ecological interactions between the arboreal and the herbaceous components is key to get the full benefits from silvopastoral systems. The objective of this 2-yr research was to evaluate productivity and nutritive value of signalgrass (Urochloa decumbens (Stapf.) R. Webster) subjected to shading from the tree legumes Gliricidia (Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Steud) or Mimosa (Mimosa caesalpiniifolia Benth.) under different tree canopy management. Trees were planted in double rows and were either unharvested or harvested only one row, leaving the other row unharvested. Response variables for the herbaceous vegetation included canopy height, herbage mass (green leaf blade, green stem, senescent leaves, and senescent stem), herbage accumulation rate, canopy bulk density, and soil moisture. Total herbage mass, green herbage mass, and green leaf mass were affected by treatment x month and harvest management x month interactions. Herbage accumulation rate in Gliricidia was greater (55 kg DM ha(-1)d(-1)) than Mimosa (32 kg DM ha(-1)d(-1)). Soil moisture was lesser at the Mimosa sites (16.2%) compared with the Gliricidia ones (17.2%), and it was greater between tree rows (21.9%) compared with full sun (11.5%), varying across the season. Harvesting management had a short-term transient effect on herbage responses. Tree canopy management can affect forage quantity and quality; however, these effects are transient and vary with tree spacing. Signalgrass grew faster and had better nutritive value when growing with Gliricidia.

AB  - Soil-crop simulation models can be a valuable tool in evaluating conservation tillage practices which are viable both economically and environmentally. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of the DSSAT (Decision Support Systems for Agro-technology Transfer) Cropping System Model (CSM) with the CSM-CROPGRO-Soybean and CSM-CERES-Maize modules to predict crop yields and root zone soil water and temperature dynamics for a soybean (Glycine max)-maize (Zea mays) rotation under conventional tillage (CT), reduced conventional tillage (RT) and no-tillage (NT) on a cool, semi-arid "Black soil" (Mollisol) in Northeastern China. Crop yield, soil water content and soil temperature data collected from a field experiment at Hailun Experimental Station (47 degrees 26'N, 126 38'E) during 2004-2011 were used for model calibration and evaluation. The soybean and maize cultivar coefficients were calibrated using the CT yield data, and evaluated using the RI and NT yield data. "Good" agreement between simulated and measured yields was achieved for model calibration (normalized Residual Mean Square Error, nRMSE = 9-15%), and "good" to "moderate" agreement was achieved for model evaluation (nRMSE = 12-17%). Simulated volumetric soil water content in the top 20 cm of CT, RT and NT were in "moderate" to "good" agreement with measurements (index of agreement, d = 0.81-0.91; nRMSE=15.3-20.0%), provided that non-destructive in situ measurements of water content were used. Overall agreement between measured and simulated soil temperature varied from "poor" to "excellent" depending on year and tillage; and the measured soil temperatures were consistently overestimated (mean error, E=3.2-6.2), possibly due to lack of accounting in DSSAT for the insulating effects of accumulated surface residues, and the shading effects of standing crops. Refinement of the soil temperature algorithm in DSSAT is recommended. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Findings from the investigations on the effects of different soil nutrient managements and cooking methods on nutrient and phytochemical composition of orange-fleshed sweet potato (Umudike Sweet Potato Variety 3) (UMUSPO 3 Ipomea batatas) are reported in this article. UMUSPO 3 potato vines (main plot) were planted on eight sub- plots treated with different soil nutrients (Poultry manure, agrolyser and NPK) combinations (VB1 - VB8) and a control (VB9) at the National Root Crops Research Institute experimental farm, Umudike, Abia State, Nigeria. Potato tubers were harvested after 4 months of planting and both cooked and raw samples were subjected to chemical and sensory analysis. Carbohydrate and dry matter contents were highest and respectively 16.4% and 29.79% in potatoes harvested from the control soil (VB9). Both control and treated soils yielded potatoes that were high in calcium (86.94 - 96.47 mg/100g), magnesium (73.62 - 86.87 mg/100g), phosphorus (151.26 - 195.97 mg/100g), potassium (790.30 - 901.54 mg/100g) and sodium (74.50 - 81.84 mg/100g). Only soil treatments with NPK 15:15:15 at 400 kg/ha (VB5) improved protein contents of raw potatoes from 5.26% to 6.13% while other soil treatments decreased the protein content. Potato harvested from the control and various soil treatments (VB1 -VB8) were rich in vitamin C (53.34 - 95.37 mg/100 g) and carotene (28.52 - 29.73 mg/100 g) but relatively low in the B vitamins. Soil treatments VB1 to VB8 did not improve vitamin contents of potatoes beyond that of the control for vitamin B1. Cooking methods and cooking time affected carotenoid retention in UMUSPO 3 potato. Carotenoid retention was higher in oven-dried samples than in roasted and boiled samples. Oven-drying for 24h decreased total carotenoid retention to 76.4%, and for 48h to 36.3%. Boiling for 10 min decreased carotenoid content to 56.4%, and for 30 min to 17.1%. Roasting for 10 min reduced it to 50.6%, and for 30 min to 30.9%.

AB  - It has been demonstrated that soil moisture sensor systems (SMSs) designed for landscape irrigation can save water. However, SMSs have not been tested with reclaimed wastewater. Both salts contained in the irrigation water and temperature might alter the soil water content (SWC) sensed by SMSs. The objective of this research was to quantify the effect of salinity and/or temperature on the precision and accuracy of three different commercially available SMSs. The brands, controllers, and probes selected for this experiment were as follows: Acclima, SCX, and Digital TDT, Baseline, WaterTec S100, and biSensor, and Dynamax, IL200-MC, and SM200. Every SMS was replicated three times. Each SMS probe was installed in the center of different containers filled with an Arredondo fine sand. The containers were placed in a controlled-temperature chamber and were saturated and dried down across a combination of three temperatures (10, 25, or 35 degrees C) and three electrical conductivities (0, 0.7, or 5dS/m). Each container was placed on a platform scale to determine soil water losses, by weight variation over time. The actual or measured SWCs were then compared with their respective SMS readings. A regression analysis was performed, per brand, for each combination of salinity and temperature. Acclima resulted in the most robust and reliable system, with no practical reading variations when exposed to different combinations of temperatures and salinities. Both Baseline and Dynamax systems were sensitive to high salinity and/or high temperature, making their use more difficult in extreme or changing situations. However, all tested SMSs followed with adequate precision the SWC under the different salinity and temperature scenarios. Consequently, these SMSs might achieve an adequate landscape irrigation control, even when their readings might not correspond to the actual SWC. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Recently, emphasis has been placed on finding a reliable estimation of soil water content. In this study, two capacitance sensors EC5 and 5TE (METER Group) were utilized. These sensors provide many benefits relative to other sensors in that they are cost-effective and very economical regarding energy use, operate at a high measurement frequency of 70 MHz, and are dedicated to measuring at a small volume because of their small size. This makes them suitable for the context of use in this research, which consists of multiple sustainable drainage systems SuDS. Several studies have evaluated these two types of sensor but not for urban soils with specific characteristics. In addition, results from the literature are divergent and the published calibration data are limited. Therefore, an in-depth investigation of their accuracy is assessed in this paper. At first, the literature's existing procedures and methods were examined. The sensor-to-sensor variability, as well as repeatability, were tested in soil and solutions. Additionally, a field calibration method was conducted to estimate the effects of soil texture on sensors readings. Two laboratory calibration methods having different principles were also applied, compared to each other and to the field calibration as well. Results revealed weak sensor-to-sensor variability (coefficient of variation up to 15% in soil) and also good repeatability (0.1%), for both sensors. A soil-specific calibration equation has improved the estimation of the volumetric water content. In case of soil having high field bulk density, the undisturbed soil calibration method described and proposed in this paper gives promising results. The latter method yields a volumetric water content (VWC) prediction accuracy of 0.025 m(3)center dot m(-3) on a sandy loam soil. This paper presents a large knowledge of capacitance sensors measurement technique as well as their calibration procedures and methods. Limitations of existing procedures have been identified and key elements for selecting the appropriate one are suggested. Derived calibration equations have also been provided for three urban soils with different particle size distribution, ranging from sandy loam to silt loam. Accurate monitoring of soil moisture content in urban soils is thus achievable.

AB  - This study investigates the ability of machine learning models to retrieve the surface soil moisture of a grassland area from multispectral remote sensing carried out using an unoccupied aircraft system (UAS). In addition to multispectral images, we use terrain attributes derived from a digital elevation model and hydrological variables of precipitation and potential evapotranspiration as covariates to predict surface soil moisture. We tested four different machine learning algorithms and interrogated the models to rank the importance of different variables and to understand their relationship with surface soil moisture. All the machine learning algorithms we tested were able to predict soil moisture with good accuracy. The boosted regression tree algorithm was marginally the best, with a mean absolute error of 3.8% volumetric moisture content. Variable importance analysis revealed that the four most important variables were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing and machine learning. Our modeling approach and the variable importance and relationships we have assessed in this study should be useful for management and environmental modeling tasks where spatially explicit soil moisture information is important.

AB  - A reliable estimation of soil moisture conditions is fundamental for rivers' discharge predictions, especially in small catchments where flash floods occur. In this context, microwave remote sensing can be exploited to estimate soil moisture at large scale. These estimates can be used to enhance the predictions of hydrological models using data assimilation techniques. Flash flood early warning systems can, thus, be improved. This study tested the effect of the assimilation of three different ASCAT-derived soil moisture products, processed and distributed within the EUMETSAT H-SAF framework (SM-OBS-1, SM-OBS-2, SM-DAS-2), into a distributed physically based hydrological model (Continuum). The study areas were three Italian catchments, representative of the typical Mediterranean small basins prone to flash floods. The products were first preprocessed in order to be comparable with the model soil moisture state estimate. Subsequently, they were assimilated using three Nudging-based techniques. Then, observed discharges were compared with the modeled one in order to understand the impact of the assimilation. The analysis was executed for a multiyear period ranging from July 2012 to June 2014 in order to test the assimilation algorithms for operational purposes in real-cases scenarios. Findings showed that the assimilation of H-SAF soil moisture products with simple preprocessing and assimilation techniques can enhance discharge predictions; the improvements significantly affect high flows. Although SM-OBS-2 and SM-DAS-1 are added-value products with respect to SM-OBS-1 (respectively, higher spatial and temporal resolution), they may not necessarily perform better. The impact of the assimilation strongly relies on the permanent catchment characteristics (e.g., topography, hydrography, land cover).

AB  - This paper discusses the influence of the moisture content on the seasonal behavior of both soil resistivity and ground resistance typical of power distribution grounding systems. Although field surveys indicate a wide variation in the moisture content only for the topmost soil layer, laboratory tests show that the resistivities of several types of soil are greatly affected. As a consequence, the ground resistance of systems with small dimensions may vary significantly and compromise the lightning performance of protection systems. The strong correlation, identified from measurements in this work, between soil moisture and, thus, soil resistivity, and monthly rainfall allows extrapolating resistivity measurements for the most critical conditions providing data that can be used to improve the design and performance of grounding systems.

AB  - Maize-based intercropping, especially with legumes, can result in increased yields of the whole cropping system and lead to efficient utilization of soil phosphorus (P). Field experiments were conducted for two consecutive years to investigate the mechanisms behind the increased yields of maize by increasing soil P availability in intercropping systems and how P application and companion crops influenced the process. The planting patterns and P fertilizer application rates significantly affected P taken up by maize. The increased yields of maize average increases of 22.67 and 12.60% for maize (Zea mays)/soybean (Glycine max) and maize/sweet potato (Dioscorea esculenta)intercropping, respectively; and 12.60 and 7.17% for maize/soybean and maize/sweet potato after P fertilization, respectively - indicated that the interspecific stimulation of P uptake may be a general phenomenon controlled by soil P availability and crop species. Under the maize/soybean intercropping system, considerable facilitation was observed when roots were not kept separate; suggesting that selective enrichment of competent species may be responsible for increased P uptake during intercropping. Positive interactions were supported by soil P activation processes that increased P availability, such as pH changes and acid phosphatase activity. In the intercropping of maize/soybean, acid phosphatase activity was significantly higher than that of maize/sweet potato. In accordance, soil acidification increased with root interaction. Soil acidification increased in maize/soybean intercropping with root contact as did acid phosphatase activity especially in P-deficient soil, which enhanced soil P availability. It was concluded that there was indeed P activation when maize grew with root interactions in the maize/soybean and maize/sweet potato systems. However, the facilitation was stronger in P-deficient soil. Interspecific interactions and P application together contributed to the yield advantage of intercropping.

AB  - Purpose Phosphorus (P) is important for production in double-cropped wheat and cotton systems. The spatial distribution of soil Olsen-P has not been examined in these systems, and was quantified in the study reported here. Methods A two-year field experiment was conducted comprising mono-cotton as control (CM), and wheat-cotton 3:1 (3 rows of wheat, 1 row cotton), and wheat-cotton 6:2 (6 rows of wheat, 2 rows of cotton) cropping systems. Soil samples were collected spatially using the spatial grid method. The distribution of soil Olsen-P was analyzed using the Kriging method. Results The contour map could reflect the distribution of soil Olsen-P. The Olsen-P were concentrated near its application onto the soil surface and decreased with depth. And this distribution was changed by the uptake and interception of crop roots. The P concentrated in the cotton rows were quickly reduced, with little change in the middle of the two rows in the CM. When wheat existed, soil Olsen-P accumulated under wheat roots, and marginally moved horizontally to the cotton rows after wheat was harvested. Conclusions The geo-statistical method provided an effective method to display the distribution and movement of soil nutrients. The spatial and temporal distribution of Olsen-P was significantly affected by fertilization and crop uptake. In different cropping systems, difference in the competitiveness of crop also had significant impacts on the distribution of soil Olsen-P. The present study provided favorable information for exploring the relationship between plant and soil.

AB  - Background and AimsPhosphorus (P) plays a vital role in plant physiology, and the soils of Chinese fir-producing areas are rich in aluminum and iron ions, making phosphorus highly susceptible to fixation. Insufficient phosphorus nutrient supply is a main constraint to the sustainability of Chinese fir plantations. The aim of this study is to ameliorate the problem of soil available phosphorus deficiency in Chinese fir plantations by changing the management mode, introducing local broad-leaved tree species to form multiple layers of different ages, thereby enhancing soil productivity.MethodsThe properties and phosphorus fractions of the surface soils (0-20 cm), litter and leaf nutrients were determined, and macro-genomic technique was used to explore changes of soil phosphorus cycling (P-cycling) genes.Results(1) The close-to-nature management (CNM) significantly increased soil organic carbon (SOC) and available phosphorus (AP) content and affected litter and plant nutrients. (2) The CNM affected the availability of soil phosphorus. The labile phosphorus (resin-P, NaHCO3-Pi) and moderately labile phosphorus (NaOH-Pi) were significantly higher in CNM forests than in Chinese fir plantation. (3) The relative abundances of most of the P-cycling genes differed between the forests, with higher abundances of P-solubilization (ppa), P-mineralization (phnL and opd) and P-regulatory (phoB) genes in CNM forests. Moreover, MBC (microbial biomass carbon), SOC, total nitrogen (TN) and LTP (litter total phosphorus) were the main factors affecting the composition of soil P-cycling genes.ConclusionsThe CNM affected properties (soil, litter and plant) and improved soil phosphorus availability and the relative abundance of P-cycling genes. This study revealed the regulation mechanism of P-cycling in the CNM of Chinese fir plantation from microbial P-cycling genes perspective, which highlights the importance of P supply and microbial metabolic strategy by CNM of Chinese fir plantation.

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of wind and bed slope on uniformity of water and soil moisture distribution in solid-set sprinkler systems. For that, six plots of 25 x 30 m with bed slopes varying from 1.3 to 13.4% were selected in the Bileh-Savar Sprinkler Irrigation Network in Iran. For each plot, uniformity of water distribution and soil moisture monitoring tests were performed with three replications under different climates and operating pressures. In each of the tests, water application depth and soil moisture were measured at 164 and 143 spots in each plot, respectively. Based on computations and with regard to the ranges of environmental and systemic variations, uniformity coefficients of water application varied from 45 to 84%. In order to investigate the variations among different parameters, a number of relations were obtained to hold among different assessment indices. The results showed that proper management of the operating pressure during irrigation could largely cancel out the negative effects of high wind speed and also its variations on water application uniformity. The sensitivity analysis of the relations obtained also revealed that the uniformity coefficient of soil moisture is more sensitive to the uniformity coefficient of water application than to plot bed slope. Also, the fields with milder bed slopes are more suitable for improving uniformity of soil moisture distribution. The findings indicate a more uniform distribution of soil moisture compared to that of water depth across the plots. Hence, it seems that in and and semi-arid areas where water resources are scarce, there will be no need for higher water consumption to increase uniformity of water application beyond 75%.

AB  - Monitoring soil moisture is still a challenge: it varies strongly in space and time and at various scales while conventional sensors typically suffer from small spatial support. With a sensor footprint up to several hectares, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a modern technology to address that challenge.
   So far, the CRNS method has typically been applied with single sensors or in sparse national-scale networks. This study presents, for the first time, a dense network of 24 CRNS stations that covered, from May to July 2019, an area of just 1 km(2): the pre-Alpine Rott headwater catchment in Southern Germany, which is characterized by strong soil moisture gradients in a heterogeneous landscape with forests and grasslands. With substantially overlapping sensor footprints, this network was designed to study root-zone soil moisture dynamics at the catchment scale. The observations of the dense CRNS network were complemented by extensive measurements that allow users to study soil moisture variability at various spatial scales: roving (mobile) CRNS units, remotely sensed thermal images from unmanned areal systems (UASs), permanent and temporary wireless sensor networks, profile probes, and comprehensive manual soil sampling. Since neutron counts are also affected by hydrogen pools other than soil moisture, vegetation biomass was monitored in forest and grassland patches, as well as meteorological variables; discharge and groundwater tables were recorded to support hydrological modeling experiments.
   As a result, we provide a unique and comprehensive data set to several research communities: to those who investigate the retrieval of soil moisture from cosmic-ray neutron sensing, to those who study the variability of soil moisture at different spatiotemporal scales, and to those who intend to better understand the role of rootzone soil moisture dynamics in the context of catchment and groundwater hydrology, as well as land-atmosphere exchange processes. The data set is available through the EUDAT Collaborative Data Infrastructure and is split into two subsets: https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.282675586fb94f44ab2fd09da0856883 (Fersch et al., 2020a) and https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.bd89f066c26a4507ad654e994153358b (Fersch et al., 2020b).

AB  - Recommendations for nitrogen (N) fertilization are based on the analysis of the soil mineral N (SMN) content of one composite sample that is assumed to represent the average concentration, but that almost by definition fails to properly represent the inherent spatial variability of the field. Improvement in N management can thus be achieved by high-resolution measurements of the soil N status. However, soil sampling, transportation, sample preparation and laboratory analysis are laborious, costly and time-consuming. Additionally, errors associated with all these steps (particularly sampling and sample preparation) are notorious sources of inaccuracy. In situ and on-line measurement modes could overcome these drawbacks. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of proximal soil sensing technologies for in situ and on-line measurements of total nitrogen (TN) and mineral N in soils. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) have been successfully used in in situ and on-line measurement platforms for determining TN. The review also focuses on data fusion (DF) approaches not only to improve the prediction performance of TN by vis-NIRS and MIRS but also to delineate management zones for site-specific N management. Electrochemical sensors such as ion-selective electrodes (ISE) or ion-selective field-effect transistors (ISFET) were found to be the most suitable to measure SMN. However, it was found that both sensor technologies are difficult to use for on-line measurements because they require the preparation of a soil solution and sufficient time delay is needed to reach a stable plateau. These limitations restrict the implementation of electrochemical sensing tools for site-specific N management, although they are the best methods to measure SMN, a needed parameter as a direct measure to determine N recommendations. Research on proximal soil sensing (PSS) for N measurement in soils should focus on the development of robust and accurate in situ and on-line sensors for SMN, whereas improvement in the performance of vis-NIRS and MIRS for TN prediction by using advanced modelling and DF techniques is recommended. This development is essential to promote the implementation of variable rate N fertilization (VRNF). The review suggested the fusion of on-line collected soil data with crop data, present and historical yield, topography and weather conditions as the optimal solution for map-based and sensor-based VRNF scenarios. Furthermore, a new approach for VRNF, designated as the map-sensor-based approach, is proposed. In this approach, management zones (MZ) maps for the soil is developed in advance at the beginning of the cropping season, and this information is combined with current crop growth status [e.g., normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI)], measured with a proximal crop sensor to calculate the recommendation and implement VRNF in real-time.

AB  - Farms in Western Australia (WA) are highly variable in soil texture and water retention capacity; therefore, information of soil moisture spatial variability in the field is important for effective crop management. In practice, farmers often rely on point sensors to determine soil moisture in their fields for crop planning. The limitation of point measurements to account for spatial variability highlights the need to develop methods that can assess soil moisture across variable broadacre fields. This information can enable more effective site-specific crop management practices. In this study, we used a mobile non-intrusive electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor to map soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) to predict soil moisture levels at three different depths (0-0.5, 0.5-0.8 and 0.8-1.6 m) across the field and compared it with barley yield production. To convert the depth specific electrical conductivity (EC) from EMI surveys into soil moisture estimates, calibrations between electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to volumetric moisture were used. These calibrations were developed for the different soil textural classes of the field, with R2 of 0.97-0.99. There was no significant difference between the estimated soil moisture from EMI surveys and the point moisture measurements obtained from soil moisture sensors and soil sample extracts, with Pearson R values of 0.64 for 0-0.5 m depth and 0.73 for 0.5-0.8 m depth. Additionally, correcting the temperature drift relative to the measured soil temperature on EMI surveys by 10% in dry season and 31% in wet season, improved the moisture estimation results. This study successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of spatial soil moisture estimation using EMI sensor in a field characterized by horizontal and vertical soil texture variability. However, no significant correlation was found between the mapped soil moisture or soil texture with barley yield. This may be due to relatively high initial moisture levels resulting from two years of fallow rotation.

AB  - Soil moisture content, theta, of a bare and vegetated UK gravelly sandy loam soil (in situ and repacked in small lysimeters) was measured using various dielectric instruments (single-sensor ThetaProbes, multi-sensor Profile Probes, and Aquaflex Sensors), at depths ranging between 0.03 and I m, during the summers of 2001 (in situ soil) and 2002 (mini-lysimeters). Half-hourly values of evaporation, E, were calculated from diurnal changes in total soil profile water content, using the soil water balance equation.
   For the bare soil field, Profile Probes and ML2x ThetaProbes indicated a diurnal course of theta that did not concur with typical soil physical observations: surface layer soil moisture content increased from early morning until about midday, after which theta declined, generally until the early evening. The unexpected course of theta was positively correlated to soil temperature, T-s, also at deeper depths. Aquaflex and ML1 ThetaProbe (older models) outputs, however, reflected common observations: 0 increased slightly during the night (capillary rise) and decreased from the morning until late afternoon (as a result of evaporation). For the vegetated plot, the spurious diurnal theta fluctuations were less obvious, because canopy shading resulted in lower amplitudes of T-s. The unrealistic theta profiles measured for the bare and vegetated field sites caused diurnal estimates of E to attain downward daytime and upward night-time values.
   In the mini-lysimeters, at medium to high moisture contents, theta values measured by (ML2x) ThetaProbes followed a relatively realistic course, and predictions of E from diurnal changes in vertically integrated theta generally compared well with lysimeter estimates of E. However, time courses of theta and E became comparable to those observed for the field plots when the soil in the lysimeters reached relatively low values of theta. Attempts to correct measured theta for fluctuations in T, revealed that no generally applicable formula could be derived. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A combined 1D and 2D electrical resistivity surveys as well as laboratory determination of soil moisture contents of topsoil in a University cultivated farmland is presented. Apparent resistivity data were measured along six traverses using Schlumberger and Wenner arrays while soil samples were collected from all traverses at depths of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 m respectively. The ranges of resistivity and thickness of the topsoil, clayey sand and weathered layers are 78.0-1094.0 Omega m, 0.5-1.9 m; 110.0-275.0 Omega m, 1.1-11.9 m; and 19.0-274.0 Omega m, 1.1-14.0 m respectively. 2D resistivity inverted sections revealed three zones of resistivity anomalies: topsoil with resistivity 78.0-600.0 Omega m for traverses within the farmland and that of two traverses along the entrances to the farm. The second resistivity zone represents a clay region of high moisture content with resistivity values less than 25.0 Omega m. The third layer represents weathered/fractured layer with relatively high resistivity values ranging from 116 to 600 Xm. The 1D resistivity models showed effective depths of more than 30.0 cm while the 2D image lines revealed that active water uptake zone extends to about 3.0 m depth. All the collected soil samples belong to sandy loam while the soil moisture content values ranged from 45 to 74% at different soil depths of 0.5-2.0 m. The study has shown that the integrated methods provide important methods for better management of soil water reserves for improved agricultural production. (C) 2019 The Authors.

AB  - Indirect estimates of manure N availability to crops are highly variable. We developed two methods that label dairy manure N components with the stable isotope N-15 for direct measurement of manure N availability to crops. The forage method involved the labeling then feeding of N-15-enriched forage to dairy cows (Bos taurus) to label urine N, fecal endogenous N, and fecal undigested feed N. The urea method involved the direct feeding of N-15-enriched area to label urine N and fecal endogenous N. Manure from each enrichment method was applied to a Piano silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, mesic, Typic Argiudolls) using field plots in 1999 and 2000; corn (Zea mays L.) was grown for 2 yr after each application. No significant differences were observed in manure N-15 recoveries in corn, soil inorganic N, or soil total N due to manure application year or manure enrichment method. Corn took up 14 to 16% of manure N-15 the first year and 4 to 8% the second year after application. Most N-15 recovery in soil inorganic and total N was found in the upper 30 cm of soil, indicating little downward movement of applied manure N-15. On average, 68% of applied manure N-15 was accounted for, either in crop uptake (21%) or in the soil (47%). The less laborious and less costly area enrichment method may be adequate for short-term (2 yr or less, the range of this study) manure-soil-crop-N cycling studies. Longer-term studies may need to include fecal undigested feed N-15 derived from the forage enrichment method.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) is a staple crop worldwide and yield improvement since the green revolution was attributed to chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer application. The field experiment was performed from 2016 to 2020 in the eastern part of Loess Plateau, China, to study the effect of two sowing practices were carried out before summer fallow i.e., Wide-space sowing (WS) and drill sowing (DS). The results indicated the soil water content, root length surface density (RLSD), at anthesis by drought was 44% under WS and 29% with DS, while the reduction in above-ground dry weight was 67% under WS and 56% under DS. More soil water was depleted from the deep soil layer (80-100 cm depth) than that in the shallow layer (20-60 cm depth. The average contribution rates of soil water content at sowing to grain yield under DS were 23%-25%. Thus, drill sowing in summer fallow should be adopted for high water storage and yield stability.

AB  - The use of compost tea has increased in organic agriculture as a substitute for herbicides and inorganic fertilizers, but the relative effects of compost tea produced via different methods are largely unknown. We examined the effects of compost tea on soil and plant chemistry and microbial community enzyme activity on an organic blueberry farm in Minnesota, USA. We randomly assigned plants to one of three compost tea treatments: aerated compost tea under ambient temperature, heated and aerated compost tea, and a control treatment. Heated and aerated compost tea increased soil percent nitrogen compared to the other treatments, and decreased activity of beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme involved in chitin degradation, compared to the aerated-only treatment. We propose that the production method of compost tea has a significant effect on its efficacy as an organic soil amendment.

AB  - The curve number (CN) method is widely used for rainfall-runoff modelling in continuous hydrologic simulation models. A sound continuous soil moisture accounting procedure is necessary for models using the CN method. For shallow soils and soils with low storage, the existing methods have limitations in their ability to reproduce the observed runoff. Therefore, a simple one-parameter model based on the Soil Conservation Society CN procedure is developed for use in continuous hydrologic simulation. The sensitivity of the model parameter to runoff predictions was also analysed. In addition, the behaviour of the procedure developed and the existing continuous soil moisture accounting procedure used in hydrologic models, in combination with Penman-Monteith and Hargreaves evapotranspiration (ET) methods was also analysed. The new CN methodology, its behaviour and the sensitivity of the depletion coefficient (model parameter) were tested in four United States Geological Survey defined eight-digit watersheds in different water resources regions of the USA using the SWAT model. In addition to easy parameterization for calibration, the one-parameter model developed performed adequately in predicting runoff. When tested for shallow soils, the parameter is found to be very sensitive to surface runoff and subsurface flow and less sensitive to ET. Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Missing values in in situ monitoring data is a problem often encountered in hydrologic research and applications. Values in a data set may be missing because of sensor error or failure of data recording devices. Whereas various imputation techniques have focused on hydrometeorological data, very few studies have investigated gap-filling methods for soil moisture data. This paper aims to fill that gap by investigating well-established statistical and data-driven methods for infilling missing values in a high resolution, soil moisture time series. Since 2006, the authors collected hourly soil moisture data in the Hamilton-Halton Watershed, Southern Ontario, Canada at four research sites. Each site contained nine stations with time domain reflectometry (TDR) soil sensors at six soil depths. From these distributed data sets, the authors removed values randomly (approximate to 5%) and systematically (approximate to 20%) from the data to evaluate the effectiveness of the monthly average replacement (MAR), soil layer relative difference (SLRD), linear and cubic interpolation, artificial neural networks (ANN), and evolutionary polynomial regression (EPR) infilling methods. When values were randomly removed, interpolation, ANN, and EPR were able to infill the missing values with similar efficiency, whereas MAR and SLRD were the least effective methods. Similarly, when large systematic gaps were present in the data, interpolation and ANN were the most effective methods of infilling, respectively. However, the effectiveness of both infilling methods is limited as serial gaps become larger than 72-100h.

AB  - In the current study, the use of regression-kriging (RK), artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forest (RF) methods from machine learning algorithms, were used to estimate field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), available water content (AWC) and their performance was compared. A data set obtained from 354 surface soil samples taken randomly, mostly from agricultural areas is used. The soil data set includes pH, EC, calcium carbonate equivalent (CaCO3 equivalent), particle size distribution, and bulk density (BD) values. The results showed that while FC showed a negative strong correlation (p < 0.001) with sand (r:-0.69), BD (r:-0.85), and silt (r:-0.47), it showed a positive strong correlation (p < 0.001) with C (r: 0.90). Similarly, PWP showed a negative strong correlation with (p < 0.001) sand (r:-0.73), BD (r:0.88), and silt (r:-0.42) but a positive strong correlation (p < 0.001) with C (r: 0.90). While AWC showed a negative strong correlation (p < 0.001) with sand (r:-0.61), BD (r:-0.76), it found a positive strong correlation (p < 0.001) with FC (r: 0.97), clay (r: 0.83), and PWP (r: 0.74). In the stepwise regression results showed that particle size were prominent as the most important factor in the regression equation created for FC, PWP and AWC. Moreover, FC is the most important factor to predict AWC. For the soil FC, ANN was best with excellent accuracy (RPD = 2.71), followed by SVM (2.42), RF (2.21) while RK was poor accuracy (1.10 and 1.04). Similarly, among the machine learning algorithms (RF and SVM), ANN obtained superiority by producing lower RRMSE (7.84%), RMSE (2.83%), MAE (2.37%), MAPE (7.45%), with the largest Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC) (0.961) compared to other methods. For PWP and AWC, ANN was the best algorithm with excellent and good accuracy RPD 3.17 and 1.95 respecively. In addition, other machine learning algorithms have been the same value range in terms of LCCC. Therefore, we recommend the ANN machine-learning algorithm is more favorable to predict FC, PWP and AWC than both RK and other machine learning methods.

AB  - In the southern U.S., rollers/crimpers are used to terminate cover crops approximately 3 weeks before planting cotton when the cover crop reaches >90% termination. When spring is wet or cold, the 3-week period is reduced to keep recommended planting dates. A 3-year experiment was initiated in Alabama to determine the effectiveness of a 4-stage roller/crimper in increasing termination rates for cereal rye compared to 2-stage and spiral rollers/crimpers in rolling 1, 2, and 3 times over rye along with a single-pass smooth roller with glyphosate application. Effects of rye termination at 7, 14, and 21 days after rolling were assessed as were the effects on soil water conservation, cotton population, and yield. Seven days after rolling, the 4-stage, 2-stage, and spiral rollers rolling 3 times generated 96, 92, and 81% termination, respectively. Termination with the smooth roller with glyphosate was 94% and the control (no rolling) was 37%. At 14 days, termination among rollers was 91 to 98% and at 21 days no differences were found among rollers (99-100%). The 4-stage roller 3 times had the highest average soil volumetric water content (VWC) of 16.1%, whereas the spiral roller 1 time had the lowest (13.6%). Rolled rye had higher VWC content averaging 14.7% (12-cm surface layer) compared to the control (12.7%). Rolling treatments affected cotton emergence only in 2015; cotton population and yield were not affected. Seven days after rolling, the 4-stage and 2-stage roller/crimpers exceeded 90% rye termination making earlier cotton planting possible if required by climatic conditions.

AB  - A procedure for soil moisture (SM) estimation over flat lands in the Argentinian Pampas region, using the water balance equation that considers SM to be the result of water inflows and outflows to the soil system, is presented. In recent years, remotely sensed data with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and radiometer sensors have been used to develop different methodologies to obtain SM maps. Thus, a variety of methodologies with different levels of complexity are available nowadays. These models require soil information such as soil physical properties and mineral composition, not readily available in Argentina and many other remote areas of the world. The procedure presented in this paper takes into account water input and output processes of the soil system and represents them with different hydro-environmental variables and SAR data. The water balance equation was solved with Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) statistical models, fed with readily available data over Comisio In Nacional de Actividades Espaciales (CONAE) core site located in Cordoba province, Argentina. The resulting models were obtained with precipitation (PP), air temperature () and relative humidity (RH) observations and with SAR data from the Sentinel-1A satellite mission. The accuracy of the model estimates represents 10 of the observed measured values of SM and is in line with state of the art algorithms. Results suggest that any model can be used with similar precision, since they show similar errors, although the MLR method allows analyzing and quantifying the errors introduced by the variables.

AB  - Phosphorus is found in the soil in several forms that vary according to the chemical nature of the compounds and the bound energy. Therefore, methods for routine evaluation for the availability of P to plants should be able to extract the forms that sustain the plant uptake. This study evaluated the mode of action of Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3 and anion exchange resin (AER) methods by observing the modifications in soil P forms after three and thirteen successive extractions. Samples of a Rhodic Hapludox that had been cultivated under no-tillage and treated with annual doses of 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 kg ha(-1) P2O5, totalling 0, 180, 360, 540, and 720 kg ha(-1) P2O5 throughout the previous six years were used. After the successive extractions, the remaining soil was oven-dried and submitted to soil P fractionation according to Hedley's procedure. Results showed that Mehlich-1 and AER methods extract mainly the inorganic forms, and a portion of desorbed P is readsorbed to the colloids. Mehlich-3 promotes the desorption of inorganic and organic P forms. Phosphorus desorption by Mehlich-1, Mehlich-3 and AER occurs according to its lability in the soil, extracting the most labile forms first, followed by those of lower lability.

AB  - A progressive decline in soil fertility in taro (Colocasia esculenta L., Schott) production systems has contributed to reduced crop productivity and farm profitability, and is recognized to be a threat to soil nutrient and food security in Samoa. Evidence based on three years of field experimentation showed that appropriate nutrient budgeting is required to reduce soil nutrient deficits and mitigate soil organic carbon loss. Balanced crop nutrition coupled with appropriate crop husbandry can significantly improve productivity and narrow yield gaps. A framework to guide nutrient recommendations for taro production systems is presented and discussed. This framework proposes that recommendations for N be derived from the yield-to-N response function (from which the most economic rate of N can be estimated) and that for other nutrients, namely P, K, Ca, and Mg, recommendations be based on replacement. The replacement strategy requires the development of soil nutrient indexes, which can be used to define the long-term nutrient management policy at the field scale. This long-term policy is informed by soil analyses, and it will determine whether existing soil nutrient levels are to be maintained or increased depending on the focus (productivity, profitability, environmental protection). If soil nutrients were already at an agronomically satisfactory level, their application may be omitted in some years to help reduce crop production costs, improve use efficiency, and ensure environmentally safe levels in soil are not exceeded.

AB  - In order to support livelihoods, enhance food security, restore ecosystem services, and reduce pressure on forests, degraded land can be restored by utilising alternative land-use systems (ALUS), such as silviculture, silvipasture, and hortipasture techniques. ALUS significantly modify the dynamics of soil nutrients in both the surface and subsurface layers. Soils from the 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm layers of Leucaena leucocephala (S)-, Hardwickia binata (H)-, Emblica officinalis (A)-, and Azadiracta indica (N)-based silviculture systems, Acacia nilotica-based silvipasture systems (SPS), natural grassland (NT), and fallow land (F) were sampled in order to better understand the nutrient dynamics of ALUS. Soils under S, H, and SPS had similar to 203%, 195%, and 129% higher organic carbon (SOC), respectively, than fallow land in the 0-15 cm soil layer. In the subsequent soil layer, those land-use systems had similar to 199%, 82%, and 110% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. Similarly, in the deeper layer, those land uses had similar to 232%, 23%, and 105% higher SOC, respectively, than fallow land. SPS and NT also improved the SOC concentration significantly over fallow land. Plots under S, H, and SPS had similar to 198%, 190%, and 125% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land in 0-15 cm soil layer. In the 15-30 cm soil layer, those land-use systems had similar to 19%9, 82%, and 110% higher available N, respectively, than fallow land. These systems also improved the P and K contents in subsurface soil. Micronutrient concentrations were also improved in soils under S, H, and SPS. Hence, ALUS' adoption in degraded areas with trees provides a chance for C storage and improves the nutrient dynamics on degraded land.

The present study aims to apply the DRIS (Diagnosis and Recommendation Integrated System) for nutrient status assessment in farmers' soybean fields in northern and central Benin. Sixty-two plant leaf samples were collected during a survey carried out in 2019 in farmers' fields. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the leaf samples were analysed. DRIS norms were used to calculate the various paired nutrient ratios in the high-yielding population. Nutrient balance indices (NBI) were also determined. Nutrient requirements based on NBI were ranked according Zn > N > P > Ca > K > Mg, highlighting the importance of Zn and N in soybean nutrition. Paired nutrient ratios (N/P, N/K, Mg/N, N/Ca, Ca/P, K/Ca, Mg/Ca, Zn/Mg) were either significantly (p = 0.0001) higher or lower than those in the literature, excluding Mg/P, Mg/K, P/Zn, Ca/Zn, N/Zn K/Zn and P/K paired ratios. This observation indicates the necessity of calibrating DRIS norms taking into account local conditions and cropping systems. The DRIS model could be an important tool for refining soybean nutrient needs in a cropping system. Zinc and N levels limited soybean cultivation in farmers' fields and must be included in the soybean fertiliser formulations to ensure optimal yield of soybean in Benin.

AB  - Agroforestry systems strongly impact soil properties, yet their effects on the stoichiometry of soil nutrients remain unclear. This study aimed to determine the tree-cropping systems effects on soil C, N, P and K concentrations and their stoichiometry in 0-10 and 10-20 cm soil depths in a purple hillslope of southwestern China. Five typical agroforestry systems, including Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck system (CO), CO and Ipomoea batatas (L.) system (CI), CO and Arachis hypogaea (L.) system (CA), CO and Zea mays (L.) system (CZ), and CO and Solanum melongena (L.) system (CS), were investigated. Tree-cropping systems (i.e. CI, CA, CZ and CS) showed significantly higher soil C, N, P and K concentrations and clay percentage, and lower bulk density than CO system. Nutrient ratios altered inconsistently among five agroforestry systems. Soil depth differed N concentration, N:K ratio, bulk density and total porosity. Soil nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry showed significant correlations with physical properties. N:P ratio was 69.78 and 78.55% lower than the Chinese and World averages in the 0-10 cm soil depth, indicating that severe N limitation occurred in the agroforestry systems. Rational N fertilization and allocation of tree-cropping systems are urgently needed for sustainable development of agroforestry.

AB  - Field experiment was conducted in two consecutive summer seasons (2009 and 2010) to evaluate effect of integrated nutrient management system (INMS) on yield of cauliflower (Brassica oleracea var botrytis L.) and soil fertility. Studies employed integrated use of PGPR strains (Bacillus spp.) and NP fertilizer doses. Three isolates (MK 5, MK 7 and MK 9) were selected for studies along with varying doses of N and P fertilizers. Experimental set up was laid down in a randomized block design (RBD) with three replicates. Results revealed that application of MK 5 isolates combined with recommended dose of 75% NP fertilizers significantly increased the cauliflower yield by 27.29% as compared to control (recommended doses of NPK). Soil status was assessed after harvest and concentration of nutrients increased in soil with the combined use of fertilizers and PGPR.

AB  - Potassium (K) release characteristics in soil play a significant role in supplying available K. Information on K-release characteristics in soils of central Iran is limited. The objectives of this study were to determine K release characteristics and correlations of K release rate constants with K extracted by different chemical methods in surface soils of ten calcareous soils of central Iran. The kinetics of K release in the soils was determined by successive extraction with 0.01 mol L-1 CaCl2 in a period of 2-2 017 h at 25 +/- 1 degrees C. Soil K was extracted by distilled water, 0.5 mol L-1 MgNO3, 0.002 mol L-1 SrCl2, 0.1 mol L-1 BaCl2, 0.01 mol L-1 CaCl2, 1 mol L-1 NaCl, 1 mol L-1 boiling HNO3, 1 mol L-1 NH(4)OAC, Mehlich 1, 0.002 mol L-1 SrCl2 + 0.05 mol L-1 citric acid, and ammonium bicarbonate-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (AB-DTPA). A plot of cumulative amounts of K released showed a discontinuity in slope at 168 h. Thus, two equations were applied to two segments of the total reaction time (2-168 and 168-2 017 h). Cumulative amounts of K released ranged from 55 to 299 mg kg(-1) in 2-168 h and from 44 to 119 mg kg(-1) in 168-2 017 h. Release kinetics of K in the two time segments conformed fairly well to parabolic diffusion, simplified Elovich, and power function models. There was a wide variation in the K release rate constants. Increasingly higher average concentrations of soil K were extracted by distilled water, Mehlich 1, SrCl2, CaCl2, SrCl2 + citric acid, AB-DTPA, MgNO3, NaCl, NH4OAc, BaCl2, and HNO3. Potassium release rate constants were significantly correlated with K extracted. The results of this study showed that information obtained from mathematical modeling in two reaction time segments can help to estimate the K-supplying power of soils.

AB  - Significant changes in the photosynthesis of terrestrial vegetation are observed in recent decades due to climate variability, land use and land cover changes, frequent disasters and anthropogenic forcing, but this situation in the Indian context remains largely unexplored. Here, therefore, we estimate the long-term changes in photosynthesis and its key climate drivers in India. The gross photosynthetic activity peaks (FPAR (mean) = 0.57) in post-monsoon (September, October and November) due to high soil moisture (87.26 kg/m(2)), good precipitation (5.2 mm/day) and optimum temperature (21.46 degrees C) conditions, whereas it is smallest (FPAR (mean) = 0.4) in summer (March, April and May) due to very high temperature (27.37 degrees C) and lower soil moisture (55.45 kg/m(2)). The trend in FPAR over 2000-2019 reveals enhanced photosynthetic activity in India. In the northwest, both soil moisture and temperature have a positive influence on greening (i.e. moisture induced greening). Conversely, the unfavourable soil moisture and temperature conditions dominate in the peninsular region to trigger browning there (i.e. warming induced moisture stress). Our analyses suggest that the photosynthetic trend is primarily controlled by trend in the soil moisture (44.31%) and air temperature (32.54%). The warming induced moisture stress can be a serious threat in the future to drive browning in more areas. Extreme events such as droughts, landslides and fires are expected to increase in the hilly regions such as the northeast due to browning. Furthermore, as food production and forest resources influence the economy of a country like India, management and conservation of greenery are inevitable for a sustainable ecosystem.

AB  - In this article, a drip-fertigation system was compared to a control without irrigation concerning the amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the climatic conditions of north-east Germany. The investigation was carried out at a field research station in the federal state of Brandenburg. The mean N2O emissions under drip-fertigation were significantly higher than under non-irrigation. The higher N2O emissions under drip-fertigation can be explained by a constantly higher water-filled pore space (WFPS). These higher values in WFPS were caused by the necessary nutrient supply in combination with additional water application in periods with frequent rainfall.

AB  - In situ soil moisture sensors provide highly accurate but very local soil moisture measurements, while remotely sensed soil moisture is strongly affected by vegetation and surface roughness. In contrast, cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) allow highly accurate soil moisture estimation on the field scale which could be valuable to improve land surface model predictions. In this study, the potential of a network of CRNSs installed in the 2354 km(2) Rur catchment (Germany) for estimating soil hydraulic parameters and improving soil moisture states was tested. Data measured by the CRNSs were assimilated with the local ensemble transform Kalman filter in the Community Land Model version 4.5. Data of four, eight and nine CRNSs were assimilated for the years 2011 and 2012 (with and without soil hydraulic parameter estimation), followed by a verification year 2013 without data assimilation. This was done using (i) a regional high-resolution soil map, (ii) the FAO soil map and (iii) an erroneous, biased soil map as input information for the simulations. For the regional soil map, soil moisture characterization was only improved in the assimilation period but not in the verification period. For the FAO soil map and the biased soil map, soil moisture predictions improved strongly to a root mean square error of 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3) for the assimilation period and 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) for the evaluation period. Improvements were limited by the measurement error of CRNSs (0.03 cm(3) cm(-3)). The positive results obtained with data assimilation of nine CRNSs were confirmed by the jackknife experiments with four and eight CRNSs used for assimilation. The results demonstrate that assimilated data of a CRNS network can improve the characterization of soil moisture content on the catchment scale by updating spatially distributed soil hydraulic parameters of a land surface model.

AB  - Information on the amount and spatial distribution of plant roots is increasingly needed for understanding and managing crop behaviour. Soil electrical resistivity (rho) tomography has been proposed as a non-destructive method for root biomass quantification and mapping in trees but evidence is needed on the applicability of the technique at low root density and in herbaceous plants.
   We produced high-resolution 3D DC soil resistivity tomograms in containers with bare soil (B), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) (A1) on a silt loam soil, and alfalfa on a loam (A2). Root biomass (RMD), root length density (RLD), soil electrical conductivity (EC) and water content (theta) were measured destructively.
   The pattern of soil resistivity matched the spatial distribution of theta in bare soil and of RMD in rooted soil. Univariate linear relations were found between rho and theta in bare soil and between rho, RLD and RMD in rooted soil. Across all data RMD and soil texture (P < 0.01) explained a high proportion of variability in soil resistivity.
   This allows to conclude that soil resistivity is quantitatively related to root biomass in herbaceous plants even at low root density (biomass < 0.001 Mg m(-3)), providing a basis for the development of resistivity-founded methods for the non-destructive spatial detection of root mass in situ, but the response in p is of the same order of magnitude as the effects of grain size and water content. Therefore in field studies reciprocal masking of low-density roots and other soil features is possible, and the effect of variation in other soil properties should be explicitly addressed.

AB  - The intensity of grazing management required for optimal pasture and animal production from heterogeneous native grasslands has received little research in the high-rainfall zone of south-eastern Australia. The aim of this experiment was to determine how the intensity of grazing management, from continuous grazing (P01) to flexible 4- and 20-paddock rotational systems (P04 and P20), influenced the productivity and sustainability of a Merino ewe, terminal sire lamb production system run on a native grassland dominated by Microlaena stipoides and Rytidosperma spp. The present paper focuses on the animal production and feed-quality results from this experiment. There was a higher per head animal production for the P01 than the P20, with the P04 being intermediate. The differences were found for ewe liveweight and fat score, lamb growth rates and lamb liveweight at weaning. The P20 was able to run higher ewe numbers, in response to greater feed on offer than for P04 and P01, which enabled lamb production per hectare at weaning to be similar and greasy wool production per hectare to be greater than for P01. The organic matter digestibility of the ewe diet estimated from faecal analysis was lower for P20 and P04 systems than for P01 over a 7-month period and explained differences measured in sheep performance at that time. When lambs were retained after weaning, they could be kept for longer on the P20 and grown to a greater weight than for the P01 and P04, but the criteria for setting stocking rates and selling lambs from systems influenced the production from the systems. Further work is needed to investigate the interaction between stocking rate (ewe numbers and lamb sale time) and grazing management and examine different options for managing rotational grazing systems.

AB  - Researches evaluating the use of mulch has contributing to optimize soil management towards sustainability, and improving soil quality. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficiency of mulching on the reduction of erosion in a soil with sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) crops subjected to simulated rainfall and increased soil organic carbon. The experiment was carried out from August to December 2013 under field conditions, using a randomized block design with three replications. The treatments consisted of sorghum with mulch, using the local vegetation available in the area; and sorghum without mulch. Simulated rainfalls were performed in three different periods of the crop cycle (initial, intermediate, and final), using a rainfall simulator. The use of mulch in soils with sorghum crops was efficient in improving soil water retention in all phases of the crop, and maintaining soil moisture during the rainfall intervals used, resulting in the absence of plant water loss, and greater contribution to soil organic carbon.

AB  - In Mediterranean countries, where rainfall is scarce and irregular, intensive agriculture promotes erosion and nutrient losses from soil, ending eventually in contamination of water bodies. Wild shrubs may protect the soil against the erosivity of raindrops. However, some shrubs such as wild lavender are traditionally harvested by uprooting the entire plant. Thus, we studied here the impact of harvesting only a part of the plant biomass. Cultivating lavender, Lavandula lanata L., in erosion plots in Lanjaron, Granada, Spain, we studied the effect of two harvest intensities of 25% and 50% of the plant biomass, on soil erosion, runoff, nutrient loss (NPK) and soil-water dynamics. Our results show that decreasing the harvest intensity from 50% to 25% reduced soil loss by 67%: from 143 to 46 kg soil ha(-1) yr(-1). Water runoff was also decreased by 59%: from 13 to 5 mm yr(-1). These findings demonstrate that the rational harvest of cultivated aromatic plants protected the soil against erosion due to the reduction of soil-particle detachment by raindrop impact, and consequently avoided mechanical soil movement. Further, decreasing the harvest intensity from 50% to 25% reduced N losses by 65%, P losses by 42% and K losses by 64%. Soil-water content at 5, 10 and 20 cm deep was also higher for a harvest intensity of 25% than for a harvest intensity of 50%. In conclusion, this study supports the cultivation of lavender instead of wild harvest, following a rational harvest of biomass for reducing erosion and pollution as well as conserving soil-water content.

AB  - The trace of high and low ridge in the Sanyangzhuang village site showed that adopting ridge tillage cultivation technology (RT) in China has a long history of more than 2000 years. In this paper, we reviewed recent advances of the development and application of RI in China. The better yields from crops grown on ridges/furrow compared with those on flat land were attributed mainly to the improvement of soil moisture conditions, better air permeability and effective supply of soil nutrition. However, most studies of RI are mainly concentrated in upland crop. It has not been reported on RT's higher water use efficiency (WUE) and the capacity of drainage & impounding during the rice production process. New systems of ridge tillage & terrace cultivation model (RTT) for irrigated rice are described here. Further research is needed to optimize management strategies and to strengthen basic research for RTT to obtain environmental and economic benefits and to evaluate practicability and effectiveness of RTT in the paddy field.

AB  - The effects of irrigation water rates and seed bed shapes on changes in soil water and salinity status, bulk density, root growth and dry matter (DM) weights of wheat plants (Triticum aestivum L.) were investigated with a split plot design in a field trial in Zahak Agricultural Research Station in Sistan, Iran in 2005. Irrigation intervals after 80 and 160 mm evaporation from class A evaporation pan were used as main plot. Flat surface, single, triple, and six-row beds with a 20 cm row space were used as subplots. Each treatment was replicated four times. Volumetric soil water content and soil electrical conductivity (EC) were measured using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) at 0 20, 20 40 and 40 60 cm depths at nine different times during the growing season. Soil water contents were also measured at 0 10 and 10 20 cm depths using standard sampling rings at four different times. The three and six-row beds increased the EC of the saturated paste extract with the more frequent irrigation intervals in this coarse textured soil. Soil water content, DM, and root density were always greater with the more frequent irrigations (shorter irrigation intervals). Root density was greatest in 0 20 cm depth with the single row bed treatment. Grain yield and root density were greatest with single row bed treatment due to the bed shape at the root development stage (possibly due to a reduced mechanical resistance). A greater soil water content by the short irrigation interval increased grain yield and root density via reducing mechanical resistance. With the loamy sand, bulk density and mechanical resistance increased rapidly after cultivation. Bed shape at root development stage might have enhanced root growth and the crop yields. Apparently, mechanical resistance was the most limiting factor with these loamy sand soils than salinity.

AB  - Winter annual cover crops, winter rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth), can reduce weed density and build soil quality in organic production systems. There is interest in integrating cover crops and reduced tillage with organic vegetable production, but few studies have been conducted in regions with short growing seasons and cool soils such as the upper Midwest. We evaluated no-tillage production of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), zucchini (Cucurbita pepo L.), and bell pepper (Capsicum annum,: L.) planted into winter rye, hairy vetch, and a winter rye/hairy vetch (WR/HV) mixture that were mechanically suppressed with a roller crimper at two locations in Minnesota. Average marketable yields of tomato, zucchini, and bell pepper in the rolled cover crops were reduced 89%, 77%, and 92% in 2008 and 65%, 41%, and 79% in 2009, respectively, compared with a no-cover control. Winter rye and the WR/HV mixture reduced average annual weed density at St. Paul by 96% for 8 to 10 weeks after rolling (WAR) and hairy vetch mulch reduced weeds 80% for 2 to 8 WAR, whereas at Lamberton, there was no consistent effect of cover treatments on weed populations. Winter rye and the WR/HV mixture had higher average residue biomass (5.3 and 5.7 Mg.ha(-1), respectively) than hairy vetch (3.0 Mg.ha(-1)) throughout the season. Soil growing degree-days (SGDD) were lower in cover crop treatments compared with the no-cover control, which could have delayed early vegetable growth and contributed to reduced yields. All cover crop mulches were associated with low levels of soil nitrogen (N) (less than 10 mg.kg(-1) N) in the upper 15 cm. Rolled winter annual cover crops show promise for controlling annual weeds in organic no-tillage systems, but additional research is needed on methods to increase vegetable crop yields in rolled cover crops.

AB  - The understanding of neutron transport by Monte Carlo simulations led to major advancements towards precise interpretation of measurements. URANOS (Ultra Rapid Neutron-Only Simulation) is a free software package which has been developed in the last few years in cooperation with particle physics and environmental sciences, specifically for the purposes of cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Its versatile user interface and input/output scheme tailored for CRNS applications offers hydrologists straightforward access to model individual scenarios and to directly perform advanced neutron transport calculations. The geometry can be modeled layer-wise, whereas in each layer a voxel geometry is extruded using a two-dimensional map from pixel images representing predefined materials and allowing for the construction of objects on the basis of pixel graphics without a three-dimensional editor. It furthermore features predefined cosmic-ray neutron spectra and detector configurations and also allows for a replication of important site characteristics of study areas - from a small pond to the catchment scale. The simulation thereby gives precise answers to questions like from which location do neutrons originate? How do they propagate to the sensor? What is the neutron's response to certain environmental changes? In recent years, URANOS has been successfully employed by a number of studies, for example, to calculate the cosmic-ray neutron footprint, signals in complex geometries like mobile applications on roads, urban environments and snow patterns.

AB  - Aims Rainfed rice in subSaharan Africa suffers from combined drought and phosphorus (P) deficiency stresses. Enhanced root development under water stress may counteract the physical effects of drought lowering soil P bioavailability. This study was set up to evaluate how rice genotypes respond differently to variable water stress in P deficient conditions.
   Methods A greenhouse study was conducted with a full factorial combination of six genotypes, two soil P treatments (strong to moderate P deficiency) and two irrigation (W) regimes (rainfed limited and adequate). Plants were grown for 49 days and root traits were measured.
   Results The overall effects of P supply on shoot weight were larger than overall effects of water supply, water stress effects were most pronounced at highest P supply because of the higher transpiration in larger plants. Reduced water supply did not enhance P stress, and the stress antagonisms were genotype dependent. There was no genotypic variation in the increased root development in response to drought that would lead to increased P uptake. Root weight and root efficiency mainly explained shoot P content across all water treatments and genotypes with marginal effects of root architectural traits.
   Conclusion This study illustrates the importance of root biomass production and root efficiency under the combined stresses of water and P and corroborated the superior performance of genotypes Chhomrong Dhan and FOFIFA 172 that was found in the field.

AB  - Urbanization-associated land use and land cover (LULC) changes lead to modifications of surface microclimatic and hydrological conditions, including the formation of urban heat islands and changes in surface runoff pattern. The goal of the paper is to investigate the changes of biophysical variables due to urbanization induced LULC changes in Indianapolis, USA, from 2001 to 2006. The biophysical parameters analyzed included Land Surface Temperature (LST), fractional vegetation cover, Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), impervious fractions evaporative fraction, and soil moisture. Land cover classification and changes and impervious fractions were obtained from the National Land Cover Database of 2001 and 2006. The Temperature-Vegetation Index (TVX) space was created to analyze how these satellite-derived biophysical parameters change during urbanization. The results showed that the general trend of pixel migration in response to the LULC changes was from the areas of low temperature, dense vegetation cover, and high surface moisture conditions to the areas of high temperature, sparse vegetation cover, and low surface moisture condition in the TVX space. Analyses of the T-soil moisture and T-NDWI spaces revealed similar changed patterns. The rate of change in LST, vegetation cover, and moisture varied with LULC type and percent imperviousness. Compared to conversion from cultivated to residential land, the change from forest to commercial land altered LST and moisture more intensively. Compared to the area changed from cultivated to residential, the area changed from forest to commercial altered 48% more in fractional vegetation cover, 71% more in LST, and 15% more in soil moisture Soil moisture and NDWI were both tested as measures of surface moisture in the urban areas. NDWI was proven to be a useful measure of vegetation liquid water and was more sensitive to the land cover changes comparing to soil moisture. From a change forest to commercial land, the mean soil moisture changed 17%, while the mean NDWI changed 90%.

AB  - Purpose of ReviewThe ability to monitor soil moisture wirelessly can deliver immense benefits to annual crops. Real-time soil moisture monitoring allows for accurate and on-demand irrigation to achieve optimal growth and avoid overwatering. It is also an effective pollution prevention method, eliminating excessive run-off to prevent soil erosion, sediment discharge, and the dispersion of key water pollutants such as nitrogen and phosphorus to natural waterway. Current soil moisture sensors require constant a power supply or battery. Wiring can be used for soil moisture sensing of perennial crops but is also not suitable for annual crops that require significant tillage. This review aims to delineate the readiness of moisture sensors and wireless power transfer technology for developing a wireless soil moisture sensing network.Recent FindingsOf the many types of soil moisture sensors, only a few are compatible to a wireless network. They either are too expensive, have unreliable measurement accuracy, or require too much power. This review shows that capacitive sensor is a potential candidate for underground sensor networks in terms of affordability, measurement reliability, and power consumption. In addition, among all currently available wireless power transfer technologies, inductive power transfer has the potential to supply adequate power for wirelessly charging underground sensors and meet other requirements of an underground sensing network.SummaryThis review evaluates available soil moisture sensing and wireless power transfer techniques for wireless underground moisture sensing. The combination of capacitive sensing and inductive power transfer technologies has been identified as a potential solution for wireless underground sensor networks. Future research should focus on improving the calibration and post-processing algorithm for capacitive sensor while the misalignment and impact of soil need to be considered to enhance the performance of the inductive power transfer system.

AB  - In Sub-Saharan Africa, where most irrigation systems are manually operated, water allocation and irrigation scheduling are often based on uniform application irrespective of crop needs and growth stages, which results in nonoptimal water use. Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve irrigation water use efficiency through automation by employing wireless sensor-based monitoring systems. Further to the improvement of water use efficiency and yield, while reducing costs, a field trial was carried out at a farm in Harare, Zimbabwe, during the 2016, 2017, and 2018 winter seasons to test whether a new approach to the automated irrigation systems, one based on IoT and wirelessly connected soil sensors (called hereafter as WCSS), improves water use efficiency without reducing yield. WCSS method was compared with three widely used conventional irrigation methods, that is, manual scheduling, tensiometer-based scheduling, and weather-based scheduling. Impacts on water savings and yield of winter wheat crops under drip irrigation were evaluated. WCSS saved up to 25% more water compared to typical fixed irrigation schedule rates used by wheat growers during the winter season.

AB  - The importance of accurate soil moisture data for the development of modern closed-loop irrigation systems cannot be overstated. Due to the diversity of soil, it is difficult to obtain an accurate model for the agro-hydrological system. In this study, soil moisture estimation in one-dimensional (1D) agro-hydrological systems with model mismatch is the focus. To address the problem of model mismatch, a nonlinear state-space model derived from the Richards equation is utilized, along with additive unknown inputs. The determination of the number of sensors required is achieved through sensitivity analysis and the orthogonalization projection method. To estimate states and unknown inputs in real-time, a recursive expectation maximization (EM) algorithm derived from the conventional EM algorithm is employed. During the E-step, the extended Kalman filter (EKF) is used to compute states and covariance in the recursive Q-function, while in the M-step, unknown inputs are updated by locally maximizing the recursive Q-function. The estimation performance is evaluated using comprehensive simulations. Through this method, accurate soil moisture estimation can be obtained, even in the presence of model mismatch.

AB  - Systems of food production and provision face a set of complex and interdependent challenges to sustainably meet current and future nutrition needs and minimize the negative social and ecological consequences of modern agriculture. Food system localization, often in the context of specific initiatives like farmers' markets, are frequently put forth as a promising strategy for establishing more just food systems and agroecological production that relies on regional resources and in situ ecological processes rather than agrichemical inputs. Despite a significant literature on local food, there remain critical omissions in geographic inquiry, particularly analyses of scale in regard to food system localization. This article uses scale as an analytical lens to examine phosphorus fertility on farms participating in a farmers' market network in New York City. Through a synthesis of biogeochemical analysis, semistructured interviews, and nutrient network mapping, the work charts the complex and often contradictory interactions of material and discursive scales in local food systems. The lens of scale reveals multiple narratives of sustainability, indicating both the great potential for agroecological phosphorus management and significant structural problems that undermine the project of food system localization. These findings argue for a more expansive approach to localization that acknowledges a mosaic of overlapping scalar processes in food systems and that the sustainability promise of food system localization requires interconnected sustainabilities in multiple places and at multiple scales. Key Words: agroecology, local food systems, phosphorus, scale, sustainability.

AB  - Sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea L.), as a summer leguminous cover crop, is often grown before fall planting of strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa Duch.) in Florida. Although sunn hemp has been suggested as a green manure for supplying nitrogen (N) to subsequent crops, limited information is available regarding the contribution of sunn hemp biomass to soil N availability in Florida sandy soils with low levels of organic matter. This is especially true for organic strawberry production where nutrient management remains one of the major yield-limiting factors. This study was conducted in Citra, FL, and assessed the dynamics of N availability after soil incorporation of sunn hemp in organic strawberry production systems established on sandy soils in a subtropical environment. Sunn hemp was planted at a seeding rate of 44.9 kg.ha(-1) on 19 July 2017 and 24 July 2018 and terminated 65 days after seeding; a summer weedy fallow was used as the control. Containerized strawberry seedlings of Sweet Sensation (R) 'Florida127' were transplanted on 13 Oct. 2017 (22 days after sunn hemp incorporation) and 4 Oct. 2018 (8 days after sunn hemp incorporation) Immediately after sunn hemp incorporation, anion exchange membranes (AEMs) were buried in the soil to monitor soil NO3-N fluxes, together with traditional soil testing to measure extractable soil NO3-N concentrations. In the 2018 season, soils incorporated with sunn hemp residues were also incubated in the laboratory at 24 degrees C over 8 weeks to determine the N release pattern by quantifying soil NO3-N and NH4-N. Overall, nitrate fluxes monitored by AEMs in the first 3 weeks after sunn hemp incorporation were significantly higher in the sunn hemp treatment than in the weedy fallow control (by 66% to 185%) in both years. Sunn hemp incorporation also led to a considerable increase in extractable soil NO3-N concentration (by 20% to 94%). The early and fast release of plant available N (PAN) from sunn hemp residues was confirmed by the 8-week laboratory incubation study, which demonstrated that the net N mineralization rate of sunn hemp remained highest over the first 2 weeks of the incubation period. Sunn hemp showed a positive impact on organic strawberry early-season fruit yield in both years, with significant increases in marketable (by 59%) and total (by 52%) fruit weight yields and marketable fruit number (by 46%) in 2017 and total fruit number (by 15%) and weight yield (by 14%) and marketable fruit number (by 13%) in 2018. Given the typical waiting period between sunn hemp residue soil incorporation and strawberry planting as well as the lag in nutrient uptake shortly after transplanting, a large fraction of N released from sunn hemp residues is likely not taken up by strawberry plants. Our findings highlight the challenges of using sunn hemp residues to improve N availability for meeting crop demand and enhance fruit yield in organic strawberry production while minimizing environmental N losses in Florida sandy soils.

AB  - Public domain synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) imagery, particularly from Sentinel-1, has widened the scope of day and night vegetation monitoring, even when cloud cover limits optical Earth observation. Yet, it is challenging to combine SAR images acquired at different incidence angles and from ascending and descending orbits because of the backscatter dependence on the incidence angle. This study demonstrates two transformations that facilitate collective use of Sentinel-1 imagery, regardless of the acquisition geometry, for agricultural monitoring of several crops in Israel (wheat, processing tomatoes, and cotton). First, the radar backscattering coefficient (sigma(0)) was multiplied by the local incidence angle (theta) of every pixel. This transformation improved the empirical prediction of the crop coefficient (K-c), leaf area index (LAI), and crop height in all three crops. The second method, which is based on the radar brightness coefficient (beta(0)), proved useful for estimating K-c, LAI, and crop height in processing tomatoes and cotton. Following the suggested transformations, R-2 increased by 0.0172 to 0.668, and RMSE improved by 5 to 52%. Additionally, the models based on the suggested transformations were found to be superior to the models based on the dual-polarization radar vegetation index (RVI). Consequently, vegetation monitoring using SAR imagery acquired at different viewing geometries became more effective.

AB  - In recent decades, research on precision irrigation driven by climate change has developed a multitude of strategies, methods and technologies to reduce water consumption in irrigation projects and to adapt to the increasing occurrence of water scarcity, agricultural droughts and competition between agricultural and industrial sectors for the use of water. In this context, the adoption of water-saving and application practices implies a multidisciplinary approach to accurately quantify the water needs of crops under different water availability and management practices. Thus, this review article presented a review of technologies and new trends in the context of precision irrigation, future perspectives and critically analyze notions and means to maintain high levels of land and water productivity, which minimize irrational water consumption at the field level.

AB  - Sheep (Ovis aries L.) grazing, a cost-effective method of weed control compared to herbicide application and tillage, may influence N cycling by consuming crop residue and weeds and returning N through feces and urine to the soil. The objective of this experiment was to evaluate the effect of sheep grazing compared to tillage and herbicide application for weed control on soil particulate and active soil N fractions in dryland cropping systems. Our hypothesis was that sheep grazing used for weed control would increase particulate and active soil N fractions compared to tillage and herbicide application. Soil samples collected at the 0-30 cm depth from a Blackmore silt loam were analyzed for particulate organic N (PON), microbial biomass N (MBN), and potential N mineralization (PNM) under dryland cropping systems from 2009 to 2011 in southwestern Montana, USA. Treatments were three weed management practices [sheep grazing (grazing), herbicide application (chemical), and tillage (mechanical)] as the main plot and two cropping sequences [continuous spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.; CSW) and spring wheat-pea (Pisum sativum L.)/barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) mixture hay-fallow; W-P/B-F] as the split-plot factor arranged in randomized complete block with three replications. The PON and MBN at 0-30 cm were greater in the chemical or mechanical than the grazing treatment with CSW. The PNM at 15-30 cm was greater in the chemical or mechanical than the grazing treatment in 2009 and 2011 and at 5-15 cm was greater with W-P/B-F than CSW in 2010. From 2009 to 2011, PON at 0-30 cm and PNM at 15-30 cm reduced from 2 to 580 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in the grazing and chemical treatments, but the rate varied from -400 to 2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in the mechanical treatment. Lower amount of labile than nonlabile organic matter returned to the soil through feces and urine probably reduced soil active and coarse organic matter N fractions with sheep grazing compared to herbicide application and tillage for weed control. Reduction in the rate of decline in N fractions from 2009 to 2011 compared to the herbicide application treatment, however, suggests that sheep grazing may stabilize N fractions in the long-term if the intensity of grazing is reduced. Animal grazing may reduce soil N fractions in annual cropping systems in contrast to known increased fractions in perennial cropping systems.

AB  - Efficient utilization of incident solar radiation and rainwater conservation in rain-fed smallholder cropping systems require the development and adoption of cropping systems with high resource use efficiency. Due to the popularity of cassava-maize intercropping and the food security and economic importance of both crops in Nigeria, we investigated options to improve interception of photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), radiation use efficiency (RUE), soil moisture retention, and yields of cassava and maize in cassava-maize intercropping systems in 8 on-farm researcher-managed multi-location trials between 2017 and 2019 in different agroecologies of southern Nigeria. Treatments were a combination of (1) maize planting density (low density at 20,000 maize plants ha(-1) versus high density at 40,000 maize plants ha(-1), intercropped with 12,500 cassava plants ha(-1)); (2) fertilizer application and management targeting either the maize crop (90 kg N, 20 kg P and 37 kg K ha(-1)) or the cassava crop (75 kg N, 20 kg P and 90 kg K ha(-1)), compared with control without fertilizer application. Cassava and maize development parameters were highest in the maize fertilizer regime, resulting in the highest IPAR at high maize density. The combined intercrop biomass yield was highest at high maize density in the maize fertilizer regime. Without fertilizer application, RUE was highest at low maize density. However, the application of the maize fertilizer regime at high maize density resulted in the highest RUE, soil moisture content, and maize grain yield. Cassava storage root yield was higher in the cassava fertilizer regime than in the maize fertilizer regime. We conclude that improved IPAR, RUE, soil moisture retention, and grain yield on nutrient-limited soils of southern Nigeria, or in similar environments, can be achieved by intercropping 40,000 maize plants ha(-1) with 12,500 cassava plants ha(-1) and managing the system with the maize fertilizer regime. However, for higher cassava storage root yield, the system should be managed with the cassava fertilizer regime.

AB  - Cover crops can be an important source of nitrogen (N) for organic vegetable production, but N availability depends on the characteristics of the cover crop residues and crop management practices following termination. A 2-year field experiment in Michigan investigated (1) how the proportion of cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth) sown in a cover crop mixture (seven treatments ranging from 100% rye to 100% vetch plus a no-cover-crop control) influences cover crop residue quantity and quality and (2) how rye-vetch residue characteristics and the use of black polyethylene mulch (PM) interact to affect soil N dynamics, crop quality, and yield in bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) and slicing cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) production. Positive correlations among pepper marketable yield, leaf chlorophyll content (SPAD), and average soil inorganic N support that N fertility was a key driver of treatment effects. Higher sown proportions of vetch and the use of PM were generally associated with higher vegetable yields and soil N. The magnitude of yield response to PM was greater in a year with higher precipitation and greater for pepper than cucumber. Percentage of nonmarketable fruit decreased (pepper) and increased (cucumber) with PM. Pore water nitrate concentration below the root zone reflected plow layer N under PM but was more responsive to precipitation under bare ground. Our results demonstrate that PM can be an important tool for preserving N fertility benefits from high N cover crop residues for vegetable production, particularly on sandy soils.

AB  - This study was carried out at the experimental field station of the Atomic Energy Authority in Anshas, Egypt, by the aim of assessing the soil moisture status under surface and subsurface drip irrigation systems, as a function of the variation in the distance between drippers along and between laterals. Moisture measurements were carried out using neutron moisture meter technique, and water distribution uniformity was assessed by applying Surfer Model. The presented data indicated that the soil moisture distribution and its uniformity within the soil profile under surface drip was to great extent affected by the distance between drippers rather than that between laterals. Generally, the soil moisture distribution under using 30-cm dripper spacing was better than of that under 50 cm. Under subsurface drip irrigation, the allocation of the irrigation system was the factor that dominantly affected the moisture trend under the studied variables. Installing the system at 30 cm from the soil surface is the one to be recommended as it represents the active root zone for most vegetable crops, beside it leads to a better water saving in sandy soils than that allocated at 15 cm depth.

AB  - Flood irrigation is globally one of the most used irrigation methods. Typically, not all water that is applied during flood irrigation is consumed by plants or lost to evaporation. Return flow, the portion of applied water from flood irrigation that returns back to streams either via surface or subsurface flow, can constitute a large part of the water balance. Few studies have addressed the connection between vertical and lateral subsurface flows and its potential role in determining return flow pathways due to the difficulty in observing and quantifying these processes at plot or field scale. We employed a novel approach, combining induced polarization, time-lapse electrical resistivity tomography, and time-lapse borehole nuclear magnetic resonance, to identify flow paths and quantify changes in soil hydrological conditions under nonuniform application of flood irrigation water. We developed and tested a new method to track the wetting front in the subsurface using the full range of inverted resistivity values. Antecedent soil moisture conditions did not play an important role in preferential flow path activation. More importantly, boundaries between lithological zones in the soil profile were observed to control preferential flow pathways with subsurface run-off occurring at these boundaries when saturation occurred. Using the new method to analyse time-lapse resistivity measurements, we were able to track the wetting front and identify subsurface flow paths. Both uniform infiltration and preferential lateral flows were observed. Combining three geophysical methods, we documented the influence of lithology on subsurface flow processes. This study highlights the importance of characterizing the subsurface when the objective is to identify and quantify subsurface return flow pathways under flood irrigation.

AB  - A new ground temperature profile sensor comprising of a row of thermistors enables a large number of equidistantly arranged measuring points. The row of thermistors was formed using a group of negative temperature coefficient thick film segmented thermistors connected in series. After that calibration of the DC thermistor resistance R was performed at room temperature and the sensor was placed in a hole drilled on the lawn. DC resistances R of the row of thermistors were measured versus depth z as a parameter and converted to actual temperature T(z) in the ground using the Steinhart-Hart equation. The temperature profile of the ground depending on deepness z and time t as a function T(t, z) was measured on different days during one year in the early morning and in the afternoon. The temperature at the ground surface was compared with the temperature of the deepest sensor point in the ground. Thermal diffusivity D of the ground was determined using measured data T(t, z) in the periods of steady ground temperatures. The new ground temperature profile sensor was realized to investigate the correlation between air and ground temperature, observation of ground temperature profile changes and heat exchange (heat transfer, diffusion, gradient, and heat flow direction) through the ground top layer and finally humidity estimation versus deepness.

AB  - Arsenic (As) accumulation in agricultural lands has become a big environmental and health issue with rapid agricultural modernization and urbanization in China. We investigated the spatial variation of soil As and its association with soil total nitrogen (N) in intensive farming systems.
   The radial basis function neural network (RBF) and kriging techniques were used to interpolate spatial distribution of soil As and delineate the spatial relations between soil As and N based on 117 sampling points selected across Zengcheng District of Guangdong, China.
   There is a significant spatial variation of soil As, which is mainly attributed to anthropogenic disturbances and can be better delineated with RBF than with ordinary kriging for the study area. Specifically, soil As content, compared to that in either brushlands or forestlands, doubles in both orchards and croplands and triples in both vegetable fields and backyards; meanwhile, soil total N increases accordingly and shows a stronger spatial correlation than does soil As. Particularly, using soil As as a covariate can greatly improve soil N spatial interpolation, implying the effect of soil As on soil N spatial variation.
   The spatial variation of soil As is closely associated with land use. Farming activities tend to dramatically increase soil As concentration, which then enhances soil N accumulation in all intensively cultivated soils. These results suggest that farming management plans need to consider N fertilizer use efficiency for a specific land use, and more studies are needed to understand their interactions and biogeochemical processes in intensive farming systems.

AB  - The endemic New Zealand ground wet (Hemiandrus sp. promontorius') has a Naturally Uncommon conservation status. This is because of the paucity of information on its density and distribution. Here, the biology, density and distribution of a population of this wet found in and around vineyards in the Awatere Valley, Marlborough was studied. Wet density was assessed in vineyards, paddocks and shrublands in this valley. Soil moisture, penetration resistance, pH and organic matter were recorded at locations with and without wet. Wet density in vineyards was significantly higher than in either paddocks or shrub habitats. In vineyards, the density of this insect was significantly higher under-vines than in the inter-rows. Higher numbers of this wet were found in moist soils that required lower force to burrow. Females laid an average of 55 eggs between March and April, which hatched in September. These findings highlight the intersection between agriculture and conservation.

AB  - Land-atmosphere interactions play an important role in summer rainfall in the central United States, where mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) contribute to 30 to 70% of warm-season precipitation. Previous studies of soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks focused on the total precipitation, confounding the distinct roles of rainfall from different convective storm types. Here, we investigate the soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks associated with MCS and non-MCS rainfall and their surface hydrological foot-prints using a unique combination of these rainfall events in observations and land surface simulations with numerical tracers to quantify soil moisture sourced from MCS and non-MCS rainfall. We find that early warm-season (April to June) MCS rainfall, which is characterized by higher intensity and larger area per storm, pro-duces coherent mesoscale spatial heterogeneity in soil moisture that is important for initiating summer (July) afternoon rainfall dominated by non-MCS events. On the other hand, soil moisture sourced from both early warm-season MCS and non-MCS rainfall contributes to lower-level atmospheric moistening favorable for upscale growth of MCSs at night. However, soil moisture sourced from MCS rainfall contributes to July MCS rainfall with a longer lead time because with higher intensity, MCS rainfall percolates into deeper soil that has a longer memory. Therefore, early warm-season MCS rainfall dominates soil moisture-precipitation feed-back. This motivates future studies to examine the contribution of early warm-season MCS rainfall and associated soil moisture anomalies to predictability of summer rainfall in the major agricultural region of the central United States and other continental regions frequented by MCSs.

AB  - Observations of the temporal and spatial distribution of poststorm soil moisture in open shrublands and savannas are limited, yet they are critical to understanding the interaction and feedback between moisture distribution and canopies. The objective of this analysis was to study the hydrologic impacts of precipitation pulses on the upper layer of soils under and between shrubs. The study was based on measurements of precipitation, runoff, and under-and between-shrub soil moisture over a period of 20 years (1990-2009) at a shrub-dominated site in the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) near Tombstone, Arizona. Within much of the root zone (to 30 cm depth), infiltration was not significantly different under versus between shrubs, and the under: between infiltration ratio was not related to pulse size or intensity. However, root-zone soil moisture was significantly higher between shrubs than under shrubs. The soil moisture measured at the surface (at 5 cm depth) was not consistently different under and between shrubs, but the soil moisture measured at depths of 15 and 30 cm were both significantly higher between shrubs than under shrubs. Considering mechanisms that explain the interaction between plants and soil moisture, we found no differences in infiltration, evaporative losses, and surface soil moisture in locations under and between shrubs. This led to the conclusion that lower root-zone soil moisture under shrubs was due largely to greater root density under shrubs than between shrubs. This study adds to the understanding of the impact of precipitation patterns on infiltration and soil moisture in shrub-dominated sites and the potential for vegetation change in arid and semiarid lands.

AB  - Effective gas permeability is an important parameter in the design of methane oxidation systems, governing diffusive oxygen ingress and the spatial spread of landfill gas. The influences of soil texture, compaction, soil moisture and the resulting air filled porosity on the gas permeability were researched by performing pressure loss experiments on two loamy sands, currently in use as methane oxidation layer material. These experiments mimicked the influence of the intrinsic soil properties, the construction method (compaction) and the local climate (soil moisture) on the soils' permeability. In both soils, effective and specific permeability were strongly impacted by the level of soil compaction, whereas increasing moisture contents had little effect in one of the soils, only reducing effective permeability when a certain threshold was exceeded. In the other soil, structure-forming processes induced by the addition of water led to an increase in both effective and specific permeability with increasing moisture. It is concluded that the spatial spread of the landfill gas in the gas distribution layer is predominantly affected by texture and compaction of the overlying methane oxidation layer. In terms of methane oxidation system design, the choice of material and construction method have more impact on gas permeability than seasonal changes in soil moisture in moderate climates. Furthermore, air filled porosity on its own is not adequate to estimate the effective permeability of loamy sand for methane oxidation layers. Further research should address the estimation of effective gas permeability based upon soil texture, bulk density and soil moisture combined. (C) 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The availability of organic fertilisers plays a major role in organic farming systems. Such systems exclude the use of synthetic fertilisers, whilst aiming to optimise internal nutrient cycling. The low availability of manures, particularly in dry areas, can lead to negative nutrient balances in many organic farming systems. Such negative nutrient balances are mainly found for P and K. In this paper, we aim to study the availability of P in irrigated and tainted semiarid Mediterranean grassy crops with long-term organic and conventional farming practices. NaHCO3 extracts were prepared from an array of soils from 16 plots, covering organic and conventional management in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Inorganic (NaHCO3-Pi) and organic P (NaHCO3-Po) were analysed in the extracts and related to soil properties (carbonate content, pH, organic C and N content). Rainfed, organically managed soils showed low P availability compared to conventionally managed soils. However, organically managed irrigated soils showed slightly higher NaHCO3-Pi than conventional soils. This is due to the fertilisation regime applied to the irrigated, organically managed systems. Such systems received four-fold the amount of manure applied to organically managed rainfed soils. In soils with low P availability, NaHCO3-Pi was largely depleted while NaHCO3-Po remained nearly unchanged. In soils with good or moderate P availability, NaHCO3-Pi appeared mainly to be regulated by soil organic matter (organic C and N). In conditions of low P availability, NaHCO3-Pi was mainly regulated by chemical processes related to soil pH and carbonate content. The regulation of NaHCO3-Po was less clear. Under low P availability, NaHCO3-Pi depletion occurred mainly in soils with high organic C and N and low pH. In low P soils with a high pH and carbonate content, NaHCO3-Pi appeared to be geochemically protected. In calcareous soils, management practices need to increase or maintain the level of soil organic C to facilitate mobilisation of the Preserve. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The soil nitrogen (N) dynamics of an irrigated maize system in which stubble retention and stubble burned treatments were superimposed over treatments of varying N fertiliser rate were studied. The field site was near Whitton, New South Wales, Australia, and the work described here is part a life cycle analysis of greenhouse gas emissions from maize project. The objective of this part of the work was to quantify the fate of fertiliser N applied at the site. Field measurements of denitrification, mineral N content and recovery of N-15-labelled urea from microplots with and without ammonium thiosulfate were complimented with laboratory studies of denitrification and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux. Significantly (P < 0.05) more fertiliser N was recovered in the grain from the stubble incorporated treatment than the stubble burned treatment and there was greater recovery of fertiliser N in the soil at the end of the experiment in the stubble burned treatment. This may indicate that fertiliser N applied to the stubble burned system may be more exposed to soil-N transformations. The reason for the difference in uptake and soil residual is not clear but may be related to soil structure differences leading to less plant accessibility of N in the burned treatment. This difference may lead to more nitrous oxide emission from soil in the stubble burned treatments. Short-term (1 h) static chamber measurements in the field found a strong N-rate dependence of N2O emission rate for fertiliser rates between 0 and 300 kg N/ha. Inclusion of ammonium thiosulfate in the fertiliser formulation did not appear to have a significant impact on fertiliser N recovery.

AB  - A reasonable estimation of crop water uptake depth (WUD) provides vital prerequisites for determining scientific irrigation scheduling. However, real-time acquisition of crop WUD to guide irrigation has not been reported. In the current study, a smart irrigation system based on real-time soil moisture data was developed, in which the dynamic crop WUD was estimated using the spatiotemporal characteristics of soil moisture distributions. Subsequently, the data of crop WUD were acquired using a central irrigation controller to achieve a precise irrigation depth at each irrigation event. A drip irrigation experiment for tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) planting was conducted in a greenhouse in northern China. Wireless soil moisture sensors were installed to collect real-time soil moisture data from a 0-100 cm soil profile. Soil moisture exhibited a ladder trend for 0-60 cm and a stable trend for 60-100 cm. A regression equation (WUDi = 0.0119d(2) + 1.9387d.6.5795, R-2 = 0.89) quantifying the dynamic depth of crop water uptake was successfully obtained based on the characteristics of soil moisture distribution, and a water-saving scheme (i.e., irrigation to real-time crop WUD) was determined to guide every irrigation event via a remote automatic irrigation system. Tomato evapotranspiration (ET) calculated using soil moisture data was consistent with that calculated using indoor meteorological data, confirming the reliability of real-time soil moisture data for estimating the tomato WUD. The tomato irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of the established system reached 41.23 kg/m(3), which was an evident improvement compared with that obtained using a traditional irrigation scheme (31.58 kg/m(3)). In addition, the IWUE of tomato in the established system was almost approached that of the previously published results. The findings of this study highlight the importance of reasonable water-saving irrigation scheduling and provide insights into the development of an efficient and automatic irrigation system.

AB  - The effects of different planting systems on soil conditions and crop growth are not well documented in cool high-latitude rainfed regions. Therefore, a field experiment was conducted from 2009 to 2011 to evaluate the impacts of planting systems on soil moisture, soil temperature and corn yield in the center of Northeast China. The experimental design was randomized complete block with three replications. Three planting systems (RP: ridge planting, FRP: flat planting with ridging at early jointing stage, and FP: flat planting without ridging) were tested in this study. Corn yield was significantly higher under FRP than under RP and FP by 302.2 and 552.3 kg ha(-1), respectively, on average across the three experimental years (P < 0.05). Significant differences in soil moisture were found in the early stage of the growing season. Soil water storages in 0-40 cm depth under FRP and FP were higher than under RP during the period from sowing to seedling stages (VE to V1 stages). Meanwhile, significant differences in topsoil temperatures occurred among planting systems during early growth period. The FRP and FP significantly increased the daily minimum temperature in the soil layer of 5 cm on average by 1.2 and 1.1 degrees C compared to RP during the period from VE to V1 stage, despite the fact that the daily maximum temperatures were correspondingly 2.4 and 2.6 degrees C lower, respectively. Compared to FP, RP and FRP could reduce waterlogging by draining extra rainwater through furrows during the later growth period. The above findings indicate that FRP can benefit corn cropping for higher yield through mitigating soil temperature and moisture limitations to corn growth in cool high-latitude rainfed areas.

AB  - This study investigated phosphorus (P) dynamics and kinetics in calcareous soil under inorganic, organic, and integrated (inorganic+organic) fertilizer systems during two growing seasons of maize in two soil depths (0-0.15 and 0.15-0.30 m). A field experiment was conducted with 150, 300, and 400 kg ha(-1) triple superphosphate (TSP), 7.5 and 15.0 ton ha(-1) (on dry matter basis) farmyard manure (FYM), and integrated systems. In order to analyze Olsen P, soil samples were collected in 30-day-intervals after planting. The results showed that at the end of the two growing seasons of maize, the lowest magnitudes of Olsen P0-0.15 m were 6.0, 6.8, 7.4, and 7.6 mg kg(-1) for the control, 7.5 FYM, 15 FYM, and 150 TSP, respectively. The highest magnitudes of Olsen P0-0.15 m were 12.4, 11.5, 11.4, and 11.1 mg kg(-1) for 300 TSP +15 FYM, 400 TSP+7.5 FYM, 400 TSP+15 FYM, and 300 TSP+7.5 FYM, respectively. The same trends were observed for Olsen P0.15-0.30 m. Heterogeneous diffusion model demonstrated that Elovich equation could best describe the experimental data (mean; R-2 = 0.98, SE = 0.29). The highest P supply rates (PSR) were 4.73, 3.91, and 3.86 mg kg(-1)day(-1) (days after application) for 400 TSP, 400 TSP+15 FYM, and 300 TSP, respectively. The models of P supply capacity of soil could estimate P supply of soil under different fertilizer systems (R-2 = 0.84-0.95). The present study improved the understanding of the capacity and rate of P supply by considering P uptake by grain maize. Fertilizer recommendations depend on the accessibility of fertilizer types suggested to help choose the best fertilizer systems.

AB  - Soil management systems affect the P dynamics in content and forms. The aim of this work was to measure the effect of several cultivations systems in the long term (16 years) on the different soil P forms. The treatments consisted of combinations of the two cultivation systems: sole corn (C) and corn-bean intercrop (CB), with two levels (0 and 1) of organic fertilizer (OF), at rates of 0 and 40 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1) and three levels (0, 1, 2) of mineral fertilizer (MF) N-P-K, in the doses 0, 250 and 500 kg ha(-1) of the formula 4-14-8. An area under Atlantic Forest was used as reference of a balanced state. The values of total organic P (Pto) changed from 184.2 to 280.2 and from 184.4 to 282.9 mg kg(-1) in 0-10 and 10-20 cm deep soil, respectively. The highest values were observed for 500 kg ha(-1) of mineral fertilizer + organic fertilizer, corresponding on average to 26.4 % P in the soil. The C/P to ratio of the treatments tended to be constant. An increase of the Pto values with the increase of the soil organic carbon content was observed. The mineral fertilizer promoted P increment in the microbial biomass (Pmb) in the sole corn crop system. The increase of Pmb was 262 and 164 % of the system that received the organic compost in the sole corn crop and corn-bean intercrop, respectively. On average, the fraction of organic soluble P corresponded to 90 % Pto, prevailing over the basic soluble fraction. The 500 kg ha(-1) of mineral fertilizer and 500 kg ha(-1) of mineral fertilizer + organic fertilizer treatments in the intercrop system caused increases in the total labile P (Plt) values of 53 and 157 %, respectively, compared to the reference. The labile organic P fraction (Plo) corresponded to 3.7% of Pto for the cultivation systems; for the Atlantic Forest soil this relationship was 10.7% at both depths. The increments in the contents of most labile P forms, owing to the organic manure, demonstrate the importance of this management system for an improvement of the P cycle.

AB  - The efficient management of P fertilizer in rice (Oryza sativa L.) systems is essential in ensuring optimal yields while also avoiding problems related to over application. Identifying P deficient soils is critical to developing efficient P recommendations. The objectives of study were to determine the extent of P deficiencies in California rice systems, evaluate diagnostic P tests, and identify soil P fractions that contribute to crop P nutrition. On-farm P-omission experiments were conducted at 64 sites where we measured Y-leaf P concentration, P uptake, and grain yield. Soil samples were collected and analyzed for Olsen and Bray-P as well as being subjected to a sequential P fractionation scheme to determine NaHCO3, NaOH, and HCl inorganic (Pi) and organic (Po) P. From grower interviews, an annual input/output P budget was constructed for each site that accounted for P fertilizer inputs and outputs (P removed at harvest) over the previous 5 yr. Olsen-P (critical value: 6 mg kg(-1)) and Y-leaf P tests (critical value: 0.2%) were reasonable at predicting P deficiencies across a wide range of soil types. The P budget, correlated with Olsen and Y-leaf P, was also helpful in determining if the grower applied P rates were adequate as the only P deficient sites had a P budget of 0.5 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) or less. Sodium bicarbonate inorganic P (NaHCO3-Pi), NaOH-, and HCl-Pi and -Po fractions were all correlated with Y-leaf P concentrations. The only Po fraction correlated with Y-leaf P and the P budget was HCl-Po. The primary sinks for excess applied P fertilizer were the NaHCO3-Pi and NaOH-Pi fractions.

AB  - Alternate land uses that restore ecological balance with economic viability are desirable. Alternate land uses, that is, horti-pasture systems (HPSs) with Emblica officinalis and Psidium guajava trees and pasture (Cenchrus ciliaris + Stylosanthes seabrana), were introduced with different soil moisture conservation measures (staggered contour trenches [T1], continuous contour trenches [T2], stone mulch [T3], vegetative barriers [T4], and control [T5]) for reclamation of degraded land and to test their capacity to perform ecological functions and provide economic return to the farmers. After 10 years, T1 increased soil organic carbon by similar to 58% and 15% over control in Emblica- and Psidium-based HPS, respectively. T1 stipulated fruit and pasture yield by similar to 45% and 90% and 32% and 22% over control plots, in those HPS, respectively; T1 also improved fodder and fruit quality. Changing climates significantly affected the fruit and pasture yield. Despite this, T1 assured a benefit-cost ratio of 3.78 and 4.23 in those HPSs, respectively. The sustainable yield index for fruit and pasture in T1 were approximately (a) 1.85 and 1.68 and (b) 1.33 and 1.25 times higher than control, for Emblica- and Psidium-based HPS, respectively. Soil moisture conservation could enhance profit by similar to 30% and 20% in those HPSs, respectively over control. T1 can potentially recycle approximately (a) 83%, 77%, and 71% and (b) 62%, 122%, and 81% higher N, P, and K than control in those HPSs, respectively. Thus, Emblica- and Psidium-based HPS with staggered trenching could be replicated on a wide scale to enhance income, ensure fodder supply, and improve degraded land.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted to study effect of various land configurations on soil moisture conservation and productivity of pigeonpea at experimental farm of AICRP for dry land Agriculture, V.N.M.K.V., Parbhani during kharif season of 2015 and 2016. Soil of experimental field was medium deep black with low in organic carbon, low in available nitrogen, medium in available phosphorus and high in available potassium.The experiment was laid out in split plot design with three main plot treatments and four sub plot treatments. The gross and net plot sizes are 7 .2x5.4m(2) and 5.4x3.6m(2) respectively. The pigeonpea variety BDN-711 was used for sowing with spacing 90 x 20 cm. The main plot treatments were three land configurations as (L-1) broad bed furrow (BBF), (L-2) ridges and furrow and (L-3) flat bed method. Sub plot treatments were four intercropping systems i.e. (I-1) pigeonpea + soybean (2:1), (I-2) pigeonpea + green gram (2:1), (I-3) pigeonpea + black gram (2:1) and (I-4) pigeonpea + cowpea (2:1). It was observed that seed yield of pigeon pea and pigeonpea equivalent yield were significantly affected due to different land configuration and intercropping systems. The highest pigeonpea seed yield (1588 kg ha(-1)) and pigeonpea equivalent yield (1823 kg ha(-1)) were obtained with Broad bed furrows (L-1) followed by ridges and furrow (L-2) Among the intercropping systems, pigeonpea + greengram intercropping system (I-2) recorded higher seed yield (1574 kg ha(-1)) and pigeonpea equivalent yield(1832 kg ha(-1)). Periodical soil moisture observations in different land configuration considering depth of soil, higher average soil moisture was recorded under broad bed furrow followed by ridges and furrows while lesser was recorded under flat bed sowing.

AB  - Despite greater emphasis on holistic phosphorus (P) management, current nutrient advice delivered at farm-scale still focuses almost exclusively on agricultural production. This limits our ability to address national and international strategies for the delivery of multiple ecosystem services (ES). Currently there is no operational framework in place to manage P fertility for multiple ES delivery and to identify the costs of potentially sacrificing crop yield and/or quality. As soil P fertility plays a central role in ES delivery, we argue that soil test phosphorus (STP) concentration provides a suitable common unit of measure by which delivering multiple ES can be economically valued relative to maximum potential yield, in $ ha(-1) yr(-1) units. This value can then be traded, or payments made against one another, at spatio-temporal scales relevant for farmer and national policy objectives. Implementation of this framework into current P fertility management strategies would allow for the integration and interaction of different stakeholder interests in ES delivery on-farm and in the wider landscape. Further progress in biophysical modeling of soil P dynamics is needed to inform its adoption across diverse landscapes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Accurate groundwater recharge estimates are vital for the management of groundwater resources. The watertable fluctuation method (WTFM) is one of the most widely used techniques for estimating distributed recharge. This is likely due to the simplicity of its formulation and the limited input data requirements, which include groundwater level measurements and a specific yield estimate. The method is presented in alternative forms within published accounts of its use, including adaptations for non-ideal situations (e.g., aquifers subjected to extensive pumping). This review summarises the development of the WTFM and its variants, applied to the estimation of distributed recharge, and compares resulting recharge estimates from alternative forms of the method with other recharge estimation techniques. The review finds that the WTFM has been modified to account for shallow watertable conditions, deep unsaturated zones, groundwater pumping, seasonal variations in evapotranspiration, and aquifers with hydraulic properties that vary with depth. A key component of the WTFM is the projection of the antecedent recession curve to account for groundwater discharge during periods of watertable rise, for which there are multiple approaches. The best choice for projecting the recession curve remains unclear. Opportunities to develop the WTFM and improve its reliability include modifications to account for common boundary effects (e.g., proximity to rivers, etc.), evaluating the accuracy of recession curve projection techniques, assessing the spatial scale for which WTFM estimates of recharge apply, and incorporating more complex storage terms into the WTFM. Despite the extensive use of the WTFM, systematic testing has been limited and is therefore needed, including for the many alternative forms of the WTFM.

AB  - Predicting simultaneous movement of liquid water, water vapor, and heat in the shallow subsurface has many practical interests. The demand for multidimensional multiscale models for this region is important given: (a) the critical role that these processes play in the global water and energy balances, (b) that more data from air-borne and space-borne sensors are becoming available for parameterizations of modeling efforts. On the other hand, numerical models that consider spatial variations of the soil properties, termed here as multiscale, are prohibitively expensive. Thus, there is a need for upscaled models that take into consideration these features, and be computationally affordable. In this paper, a multidimensional multiscale model coupling the water flow and heat transfer and its respective upscaled version are proposed. The formulation is novel as it describes the multidimensional and multiscale tensorial versions of the hydraulic conductivity and the vapor diffusivity, taking into account the tortuosity and porosity properties of the medium. It also includes the coupling with the energy balance equation as a boundary describing atmospheric influences at the shallow subsurface. To demonstrate the accuracy of both models, comparisons were made between simulation and field experiments for soil moisture and temperature at 2, 7, and 12 cm deep, during 11 days. The root-mean-square errors showed that the upscaled version of the system captured the multiscale features with similar accuracy. Given the good matching between simulated and field data for near-surface soil temperature, the results suggest that it can be regarded as a 1-D variable.
   Plain Language Summary Models that predict the simultaneous movement of liquid water, vapor, and heat in the shallow subsurface has many practical interests, given the critical role these processes play in the global water and energy balances. Given the limitation in computational capabilities, important details describing the interaction between heat and water near the subsurface, including the type of soil and its spatial variability, have not yet been accounted for in current one-dimensional models. This is a new multiple scale and multidimensional formulation that accounts for the pore geometry, as it includes the spatially variables porosity and tortuosity into the hydraulic conductivity and also for the vapor diffusivity. The other new feature of the paper is that the corresponding upscaled model is also developed, which is computationally viable and takes the multiscale features into account. The coupled system uses parameters at the surface of the soil, such as air temperature, solar radiation, among others, making it more realistic and ready for coupling with the atmosphere, through the energy balance equation. This will allow a more accurate prediction of evaporation, which can be used into large scale climate modeling efforts to better quantify the change of the climate, its forecast and its impact.

AB  - Increased nutrient cycling in the agri-food system is a way to achieve a healthier nutrient stewardship and more sustainable food production. In life cycle assessment (LCA) studies, use of recycled fertilizer products is often credited by the substitution method, which subtracts the environmental burdens associated with avoided production of mineral fertilizer from the system under study. The environmental benefits from avoided fertilizer production can make an important contribution to the results, but different calculation principles and often implicit assumptions are used to estimate the amount of avoided mineral fertilizer. This may hinder comparisons between studies. The present study therefore examines how the choice of substitution principles influences LCA results. Three different substitution principles, called one-to-one, maintenance, and adjusted maintenance, are identified, and we test the importance of these in a case study on cattle slurry management. We show that the inventory of avoided mineral fertilizer varies greatly when the different principles are applied, with strong influences on two-thirds of LCA impact categories. With the one-to-one principle, there is a risk of systematically over-estimating the environmental benefits from nutrient cycling. In a sensitivity analysis we show that the difference between the principles is closely related to the application rate and levels of residual nutrients in the soil. We recommend that LCA practitioners first and foremost state and justify the substitution method they use, in order to increase transparency and comparability with other studies.

AB  - The accurate estimation of moisture content in deep soil layers is usually difficult due to the associated costs, strong spatiotemporal variability, and nonlinear relationship between surface and deep moisture content, especially in alpine areas (where complications include extreme heterogeneity and freeze-thaw processes). In an effort to identify the optimal method for this purpose, this study used measurements of soil moisture content at three depths (4, 10, and 20 cm) in the upper parts of the Babao River basin in the Qilian Mountains, Northwest China. These measurements were collected in the HiWATER (Heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research) program to test four vertical extrapolation methods: exponential filtering (ExpF), linear regression (LR), support vector regression (SVR), and the application of a type of artificial neural network, the radial basis function (RBF). SVR provided the best predictions, in terms of the lowest root mean squared error and mean absolute error values, for the 10 and 20 cm layers from surface layer (4 cm) measurements. However, the data also confirmed that freeze-thawing is an important process in the study area, which makes the infiltration process more complex and highly variable over time. Thus, we compared the vertical extrapolation methods' performance in each of the four periods with differing infiltration characteristics and found significant among-period differences in each case. However, SVR consistently provided the best estimates, and all methods provided better estimates for the 10 cm layer than for the 20 cm layer.

AB  - In eastern India, farmers grow rice during rainy season (June-September) and land remains fallow after rice harvest in the post-rainy season (November-May) due to lack of sufficient rainfall or irrigation facilities. But in lowland areas of eastern India, sufficient carry-over residual soil moistures are available in rice fallow in the post-rainy season (November-March), which can be utilized for growing second crops in the region. During the post-rainy season when irrigation facilities are not available and rainfall is meager, effective utilization of carry-over residual soil moisture and conservation agriculture become imperative for second crop production after rice. Implementation of suitable tillage/seeding methods and other agro-techniques are thus very much important to achieve this objective. In this study four pulse crops (lathyrus, blackgram, pea, and greengram) were sown utilizing carry-over residual soil moisture and with different tillage/seeding methods viz. relay cropping (RC)/farmers' practice, reduced tillage (only two ploughing) (RT), conventional tillage (CT) and zero tillage (ZT). Study revealed that the highest grain yields of 580, 630, 605 and 525 kg ha(-1) were obtained from lathyrus, blackgram, pea and green gram, respectively, with RT treatment. On the other hand, with conventional tillage, 34-44% lower yields were obtained than that of RT. Crops with reduced tillage performed better than that with zero tillage or relay cropping also. Impacts of different tillage methods on important soil physical properties like infiltration, bulk density were also studied after harvesting first crop (rice) and before growing second crops (pulses) in rice fallow. The lowest mean bulk density (1.42) was recorded in the surface soils of CT treatment while the corresponding value under ZT treatment was 1.54 Mg m(-3). (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In arid and semi-arid areas, soil moisture (SM) plays a crucial role in land-atmosphere interactions, hydrological processes, and ecosystem sustainability. SM data at large scales are critical for related climatic, hydrological, and ecohydrological research. Data fusion based on satellite products and model simulations is an important way to obtain SM data at large scales; however, little has been reported on the comparison of the data fusion methods in different categories. Here, we compared the performance of two widely used data fusion methods, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) and the Back-Propagation Artificial Neural Network (BPANN), in the degraded grassland site (DGS) and the alpine grassland site (AGS). The SM data from the Community Land Model 5.0 (CLM5.0) and the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) were fused and validated against the observations of the Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) to avoid the impacts of scale-mismatch. Results show that compared with the original data sets at both sites, the RMSE of the fused data by BPANN (FD-BPANN) and EnKF (FD-EnKF) had improved by more than 50% and 31%, respectively. Overall, the FD-BPANN performs better than the FD-EnKF because the BPANN method assigned higher weights to input data with better performance and the EnKF method is affected by the strong variabilities of both the fused CLM5.0 and SMAP data and the CRNS data. However, in terms of the percentile range, the FD-BPANN showed the worst performance, with overestimations in the low SM range of 25th percentile (<Q25), because the BPANN method tends to be trapped in a local minimum. The BPANN method performed better in humid areas, then followed by semi-humid areas, and finally arid and semi-arid areas. Moreover, compared with the previous studies in arid and semi-arid areas, the BPANN method in this study performed better.

AB  - Dryland Sorghum, which is the fifth most important cereal crop in the world, is grown in Zimbabwe typically as a rain-fed crop in areas receiving low, erratic and highly variable rainfall. A two-season field trial was carried out at Save Experiment Station (20 degrees 24'S; 28 degrees 29'E) in Zimbabwe to establish soil water storage, selected biometric parameters of dryland grain sorghum responses to in-field rainwater harvesting tillage methods. Deep basin tillage method significantly increased the soil moisture content by 14.6% (62.5 mm); 6.2 % (26.5 mm) above that on the ridges and in furrows of open and closed end tied ridges, respectively. Soil moisture storage in deep basins, on ridges and in furrows of open and closed end tied ridges exceeded that in conventional tillage plots by 98.0 mm (29.8%); 35.5 mm (10.8%) and 69.5 mm (21.1%), respectively. Consequently, sorghum plant biometric growth parameters in deep basin tillage treatments were significantly higher than those in conventional, open- and close-ended tied ridges tillage plots. However, the use of conservation tillage methods where tied end ridges are opened introduces homogeneous soil water build-ups in furrows and ridges as those observed in tied end ridges with closed ends. As a consequence, biometric growth parameters of sorghum are not altered by substituting open with closed end tied ridges.

AB  - The "Digital Earth" (DE) metaphor is very useful for both end users and hydrological modelers (i.e., the coders). In this opinion paper, we analyze different categories of models with the view of making them part of Digital eARth Twin Hydrology systems (DARTHs). We stress the idea that DARTHs are not models, rather they are an appropriate infrastructure that hosts (certain types of) models and provides some basic services for connecting to input data. We also argue that a modeling-by-component strategy is the right one for accomplishing the requirements of the DE. Five technological steps are envisioned to move from the current state of the art of modeling. In step 1, models are decomposed into interacting modules with, for instance, the agnostic parts dealing with inputs and outputs separated from the model-specific parts that contain the algorithms. In steps 2 to 4, the appropriate software layers are added to gain transparent model execution in the cloud, independently of the hardware and the operating system of computer, without human intervention. Finally, step 5 allows models to be selected as if they were interchangeable with others without giving deceptive answers. This step includes the use of hypothesis testing, the inclusion of error of estimates, the adoption of literate programming and guidelines to obtain informative clean code.
   The urgency for DARTHs to be open source is supported here in light of the open-science movement and its ideas. Therefore, it is argued that DARTHs must promote a new participatory way of performing hydrological science, in which researchers can contribute cooperatively to characterize and control model outcomes in various territories. Finally, three enabling technologies are also discussed in the context of DARTHs - Earth observations (EOs), high-performance computing (HPC) and machine learning (ML) - as well as how these technologies can be integrated in the overall system to both boost the research activity of scientists and generate knowledge.

AB  - An integrated hydrological model that couples a low-dimensional (2-D) subsurface model to 1-D river flow and 2-D overland flow is presented and applied to a real-world system. The 2-D subsurface equation stems from a careful integration a 3-D Richards equation along a local direction normal to the bottom of the aquifer. A Normally Integrated Model (NIM) is first compared with the integrated model CATHY (CATchment HYdrology) in regard to a synthetic test case with complex geometry, heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field of the subsurface compartment, and various interactions between the surface and the subsurface. This exercise reveals the gain in computation time associated with the use of a low-dimensional model (by a factor of 6). NIM is then applied to simulate the hydrodynamics of an actual restored hydrosystem, namely, Rohrschollen Island of the Upper Rhine River, with the aim of assessing the ability to address highly transient hydrological conditions and the efficiency of the restoration strategy. The calibration and validation steps associated with this exercise show that the coupled model describes the hydraulic head evolution and water mass balance induced by artificial injections of surface water in a channel dug for the purpose of reconnecting the Rhine to an old and clogged channel. The low-dimensional coupled model of this study is simpler than the state-of-the-art integrated models employing the solution of the 3-D Richards equation. It is, however, suited to investigate fine-scale problems in relation to water resource management and hydraulic developments, with reasonable computational costs and a physically-based approach to model flow processes.

AB  - Y Conservation tillage is a promising tillage practice for enhancing soil moisture conservation. The objective of the study is to evaluate conservation tillage methods on soil moisture and maize grain yield in Silte and Gurage zone of Ethiopia. No tillage, one-time tillage, two times tillage, and conventional tillage methods were evaluated. The treatments were laid out in randomized complete block design with three replications for three consecutive years (2018-2020). Besides soil moisture data, selected physical and chemical soil properties were collected. Economic analysis was also computed for each tillage method to select cost effective conservation tillage methods. The result reveals, conservation tillage methods had better soil infiltration and soil moisture content relative to conventional tillage. There was no significant difference between treatments in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, and phosphorus in the top 10 cm in the Mareko site. However, except for phosphorus, significant differences (p < 0.05) between treatments in soil organic carbon and nitrogen were detected in the 10-20 cm depth. The maize yield and yield components are significantly affected by treatments at the Mareko site and not significant at Mito. The results support that conservation tillage tested in this study could contribute to the improvement of soil properties and maize yield in study sites.

AB  - At field scale, surface soil had special characteristics of volumetric moisture content (VMC) with a relatively little difference and spatial heterogeneity induced by physical and chemical properties, roughness, straw residues, etc. It has been a great challenge for near infrared diffuse reflectance spectroscopy (NIR-DRS) measurement of surface soil moisture in situ. In this study, exonential decay models based on seven water-related wavelengths (1 200, 1 400, 1 450, 1 820, 1 940, 2 000 and 2 250 rim), linear models of normalized difference soil moisture index (NSMI) and relative absorption depth (RAD) based on wavelength combinations, linear or quadratic model of width of the inflection (sigma), center amplitude of the function (R-d) and area under the Gaussian curve (A) from soil moisture Gaussian model (SMGM), and partial least square (PLS) regression models based on bands were used to quantify VMC. The results indicated that (1) of all the single wavelengths, 2 000 nm showed the best validation result, indicated by the lowest RMSEp (2. 463) and the highest RPD value (1. 060). (2) Comparing with RAD, the validation of NSMI was satisfactory with higher R-2 (0. 312), lower RMSEp (2. 133) and higher RPD value (1. 224). (3) In the validation results of SMGM parameters and PLS fitting, Rd was found to produce the best fitting quality identified by the highest R-2 (0. 253), the lowest RMSEp (2. 222), and the highest RPD value (1. 175). (4) Comprehensively, a linear model based on NSMI showed the highest validation accuracy of all the methods. What is more, its calculation process is simple and easy to operate, and therefore become the preferred method to quantify surface soil moisture content in situ.

AB  - Smart farming is the integration of advanced technologies such as sensors, wireless communication, Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and robots, with traditional farming practices. The goal is to increase the yield and quality of the crops or other agricultural products, as well as to reduce the cost and improve efficiency. Sensors play a critical role in smart farming as they provide the most important information related to varied aspects of agriculture, namely soil conditions, plant growth, and environmental conditions. With the emergence of printed electronics technologies, printed sensors have gained much attention in recent years. Printed sensors are fabricated through the additive manufacturing and are extremely versatile. They can be made on any solid substrate and be conformable, flexible, stretchable, low-cost, and/or biodegradable. These unique features have made the printed sensors attractive for a variety of applications. This article aims to review the potential applications of printed sensors in smart farming. First, the state of the art of printed sensor fabrication is presented with a discussion on their advantages and disadvantages. Then, the measurement and monitoring applications of printed sensors in the key aspects of smart farming, are reviewed, including measurement of chemicals, soil monitoring, and microclimate monitoring in greenhouses.

AB  - The microwave backscattering model is one of the most effective tools for surface soilmoisture (SSM) inversion, which has strong theoretical support, but the inverse problem is difficult to solve. Advance in artificial intelligence offers possibilities to learn complex nonlinear relationships in a data-driven way, but it lacks physical mechanism. To combine the advantages of model-driven and data-driven methods, an SSM inversion approach that couples the AIEM-Oh model with deep neural networks (DNNs) was proposed in this study. DNNs with different inputs were trained with a large number of simulation data generated from the AIEM-Oh model, thus embedding physical mechanisms in the data-driven scheme. Two field experiments at different scales were carried out to evaluate the performances of the proposed approach over bare surfaces. The effects of polarization modes and prior knowledge of surface roughness on SSM inversion were explored, and the accuracy of the approach was compared with the existing methods. The results suggest that satisfactory accuracy was obtained by the proposed approach, the RMSE between the measured and estimated values of SSM was 0.03-0.04 cm(3) . cm(-3) with prior knowledge of soil roughness, and the RMSE was 0.08-0.10 cm(3) . cm(-3) without the prior soil roughness information. VV polarization was more sensitive toSSMover bare surfaces thanVH polarization. Moreover, the approach showed stable performance in different experimental regions. The results demonstrate the capability and reliability of the coupled approach for SSM inversion over bare surfaces.

AB  - A new smartphone vegetable irrigation scheduling application (VegApp) was compared with current irrigation scheduling recommendations and soil moisture sensor (SMS)-based irrigation for growing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) in southern Georgia during Spring 2016 and 2017. Plants were grown using plastic mulch and drip irrigation following standard production. The VegApp-scheduled irrigation based on crop evapotranspiration (ETc) values calculated daily from meteorological data retrieved from nearby weather stations, whereas ETc rates for current water balance (WB)-based recommendations were calculated from historic averages for the region. Water usage, soil moisture tension, fruit yield and quality, and foliar macronutrient content were measured. In 2016, plants grown using SMS-based irrigation applied the least water followed by the VegApp- and WB-grown plants. In 2017, WB-treated plants received the least water, followed by VegApp- and SMS-grown plants. Total marketable yields were similar among treatments and years. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) varied between year and irrigation regime, with SMS-grown plants having a significantly greater IWUE than the other treatments in 2016. Plants irrigated using the VegApp had a greater IWUE than SMS-irrigated plants in 2017. Differences in IWUE were largely the result of variable irrigation volumes and not changes in yield. Fruit total soluble solids (TSS) were unaffected by treatment in either study year. Fruit pH was affected by irrigation treatment in 2017. Foliar nitrogen concentrations were affected by irrigation regime in 2017, with VegApp-grown plants having significantly greater concentrations of foliar N than other irrigation treatments. The results of this study suggest that the VegApp could be a reliable tool that can be used by growers to produce yields comparable to currently accepted irrigation scheduling practices and reduce water use in some seasons.

AB  - A new smartphone irrigation scheduling application (VegApp) was compared with current irrigation scheduling recommendations and an automated soil moisture sensor (SMS)-based irrigation system in southern Georgia during Spring 2016 and 2017. Plants were grown using plastic mulch and drip irrigation following standard production practices for watermelon (Citrullus lanatus) in Georgia. The VegApp irrigation regime was based on evapotranspiration (ETo) values calculated from real-time data collected from a nearby weather station. Current irrigation scheduling recommendations use a water balance (WB) method. The WB method uses historic averages for determining ETo rates for the season. Water applied, soil water tension at 6-, 10-, and 14-inch depths, yield, and fruit quality were evaluated. In 2016, the SMS-based irrigation plots applied the least water. In 2017, the lowest amount of water was applied to plants grown using the VegApp. Total marketable yields were not significantly affected by irrigation regime. However, 45-count fruit yields were affected by irrigation in 2017. Plants grown using SMS-based irrigation had significantly higher yields of 45-count fruit than those grown using the WB method. Irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) was affected by irrigation treatment and year. The SMS-irrigated plants had the greatest IWUE, although it was not significantly different from plants grown using the VegApp irrigation program. Internal quality parameters including, firmness, hollow heart, and total soluble solids (TSS) were not significantly affected by irrigation scheduling during the study. The results suggest that overall water applications may be reduced and yields maintained when using VegApp compared with traditional WB methods of irrigation scheduling.

AB  - Plant available soil phosphorus contents are assessed by various different methods worldwide. The resulting country-specific methodology prohibits comparison or joint analysis of international data on yield response to soil P level. A change of the standard method would decrease comparability to older data, require new costly and time-consuming calibration and familiarization of advisory authorities and farmers. The use of conversion equations can allow the combination of data derived by different methods, but large differences between available equations question their reliability. The aim of this review is to provide a comprehensive overview of conversion options from P extracted by methods commonly used in Europe (acid ammonium acetate, acid ammonium acetate + EDTA, ammonium lactate, calcium acetate lactate, double lactate, H2O and Mehlich 3) to the widely used Olsen method. For a given method of soil P extraction, coefficients derived from different publications often vary by factors above two. Differences in coefficients can, at least to a certain degree, be attributed to variations in soil type, soil texture and especially pH range and carbonate contents of the soils of the according databases. In several studies, decreasing pH values increased Olsen-P values in relation to the other methods. Linear regressions are prone to bias by the right-skewed distribution of P values in most databases and therefore have to be handled with care on the lower end of the P level range. Even the option most appropriate for the soil and research purpose at hand can be a considerable source of error, therefore conversions should only be conducted if absolutely necessary.

AB  - Soil nutrients vary greatly and information regarding their spatial-temporal variability is critical for achieving site-specific nutrient management. However, the problem is that the high cost of soil sampling and laboratory analysis limits the number of samples current research budgets can afford. Besides, large sampling intervals sometimes fail to capture the variability of typical soil properties. Consequently, determining a reasonable yet feasible sampling interval to characterize the spatial variation of soil properties is greatly needed to delineate soil nutrient management zones (MZs). For this purpose, this study used four sampling intervals, 25 m x 25 m, 50 m x 50 m, 75 m x 75 m, and 100 m x 100 m by resampling the raw data acquired from seven adjacent fields located in Quzhou County to estimate the optimal design of soil sampling. Five soil properties (pH, electrical conductivity, extractable phosphorus, extractable potassium, and soil organic matter) were selected to delineate MZs using principal component analysis and fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm. The results indicated that indigenous P and K varied significantly, with the coefficients of variation of 34.33% and 24.01 %, respectively. The findings suggested that the optimal soil sampling interval was 50 m to accurately delineate MZs in medium- and small-scale farmlands. Besides, findings also demonstrated that site-specific P and K management could save approximately 21 kg P ha(-1) and 30 kg K ha(-1) as compared to conventional farming practices while ensuring target yield. The results can help make precision P and K management decisions in medium- and small-scale farming systems.

AB  - Silvopastoral systems are widely used for ecological vegetation restoration in fragile areas. As the main landform of western Henan, the low hilly areas are experiencing water and soil loss because of human activities. However, the effect of silvopastoral systems on soil nutrients in low hilly areas has not been well studied. To address this issue, we established a silvopastoral experiment in the low hilly area of western Henan province in 2011, where four plots of pure forest of poplar (Populus simonii, PS), oriental thuja (Platycladus orientalis, PO), Chinese cork oak (Quercus variabilis, QV) and false acacia (Robinia pseudoacacia, RP) was planted on a natural wasteland; perennial alfalfa (Medicago sativa, MS) was intercropped with these pure forest plots as silvopastoral treatments, i.e., PS-MS, PO-MS, QV-MS and RP-MS; one plot of natural wasteland as CK. In 2018, 2019 and 2020, we examined the soil total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) of different vegetation restorations. Results showed that the silvopastoral treatments (PO-MS, QV-MS and RP-MS) generally increased the TC and TN (by similar to 53% and similar to 51% in 2018, similar to 66% and similar to 49% in 2019, and similar to 66% and similar to 67% in 2020, respectively) compared to the pure forest treatments, and were also higher than the M and PS-MS. The change in relative TC and TN between downslope and upslope positions is higher in PS and PO, lower in RP compared to the PS-MS and PO-MS, RP-MS respectively, and non-different between QV and QV-MS. In summary, soil nutrient properties are generally higher but vary among the slope positions in the silvopastoral treatments compared to pure forest treatments in the low hilly area.

AB  - PurposeTo understand the effects of poplar-intercropping systems on soil nutrients and soil enzyme activities, and further analyzed the relationship between soil enzyme activities and soil nutrients.MethodsThree different planting systems were chosen: a monoculture wheat (Triticum aestivum) system (W), a narrowly spaced poplar (Populus deltoides)-wheat intercropping system (PWN), and a widely spaced poplar-wheat intercropping system (PWW). The chemical properties (soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP) and available potassium (AK)) and four enzymatic activities (urease, catalase, sucrase and alkaline phosphatase) in four soil layers (0-20, 20-40, 40-60 and 60-100 cm) of two sampling sites (1.5 and 3.5 m from tree row) in the three planting systems were investigated.ResultsThe SOM, TN, TP, TK, AP, AK concentrations and four soil enzyme activities were higher in the intercropping systems than in the monoculture wheat system, especially the PWN system. In the vertical direction, the soil nutrient concentrations and soil enzyme activities decreased with soil depth (P < 0.001), except AK and catalase. In the horizontal direction, the SOM, TN, TP, TK concentrations and four soil enzyme activities decreased with greater of distance from the poplar row, but the distribution trend was the opposite for AN, AP and AK. The correlation analysis revealed that the soil enzyme activities were significantly correlated with the SOM, TN, TP, AN and AP concentrations in the three planting systems (P < 0.01).ConclusionIn conclusion, agroforestry systems can significantly increase soil nutrient status and soil enzyme activities and can be an efficient method for improving soil health conditions. Additionally, compared with the wide poplar spacing in the intercropping system, the reasonably dense planting of intercropped poplar had more obvious effects on improving soil enzyme activities and soil nutrients.

AB  - Accurate estimation of field-scale root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is essential for hydro-meteorological and agricultural management. The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is an innovative technique for field-scale soil moisture observation. However, it is limited at deeper depths, and requires suitable methods for scaling the CRNP effective depth to represent the root-zone layer (up to 100 cm depth). A merging framework was developed in this study for improving field-scale RZSM with the CRNP via coupling the representative ancillary RZSM information with cosmic-ray soil moisture. By using ancillary RZSM retrieved at the most time stable location, this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets, while maintaining scale representativeness. A linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets (the cosmic-ray soil moisture and ancillary RZSM) and a reference product, which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in-situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location. The variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts, and subsequently merging the ancillary RZSM and cosmic-ray soil moisture. Performance of the merged RZSM in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter-based RZSM over three different environments was evaluated against the reference RZSM product. The results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation, root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged RZSM, and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure. Superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field-scale RZSM measurement compared to other products. This study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method, with respect to variations of CRNP effective depths. Overall, the merging framework is simple to apply, enables unrestricted-use in different environments, and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources.

AB  - Pot experiments were conducted in a glasshouse to investigate the effect of soil water content and phosphorus (P) supply on biomass, P uptake by rice cultivated in soils with different water regimes and soil available P. Results showed that P application rates had greater effect on P nutrition of rice than soil moisture content. Yield of rice grain was significantly decreased when soil moisture content was kept at 60% of water holding capacity (WHC) while the yields of rice grain were not significantly different when soil moistures were remained at 80% of WHC and waterlogged. This meant that it was possible for paddy rice variety to be cultivated in aerobic soil under the condition of sufficient P supply. The highest biomass of rice and highest P uptake by rice were found in the treatment with 0.0300 g P kg(-1) of P application rate and with 80% of WHC. Soil available P content decreased with the decrease of both the soil moisture content and the P applied. Rice crop exhausted soil P to a great extent leading to very low available soil P content when the rice crop was harvested, especially in the soil receiving no or small amounts of P fertilizer. All the results obtained in this experiment could provide the theoretic base for water and P management of paddy rice variety cultivated in aerobic soil in the southern hilly areas of China.

AB  - Nitrogen-use efficiency can be enhanced through an understanding of the nitrogen (N) mineralization behavior of organic sources. An incubation study was conducted to assess the impact of organic manures on N mineralization. The manures, farmyard manure (FYM), Leucaena leucocephala, and poultry manure, were applied to the soil alone or along with urea. There was a rapid increase in the amount of mineral N released with a peak appearing either at 14days (+urea treatments) or 21days (manure only) of aerobic incubation. Thereafter the net N mineralized decreased gradually and levelled off beyond day 56. Overall the cumulative net N mineralized after 98days of incubation was in the order urea > Leucaena + urea > poultry manure + urea (>) FYM + urea > Leucaena > poultry manure > FYM > zero N. The potentially mineralizable N (N-0) was lower in treatments where urea was not applied.

AB  - Information on soil moisture is important for crop and water management. This study investigated soil moisture variability in relation to rice cropping systems in the Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam, using MODIS data acquired from January to April, 2002 to 2007. The soil moisture was estimated using the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). This index was empirically calculated by parameterizing the relationship between the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The rice cropping systems were classified using time-series MODIS NDVI data for 2002 and 2006. The data were processed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), principal component analysis (PCA) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) methods. Various spatial and non-spatial data were also collected for accuracy validation of the TVDI and classification results. Comparisons reveal good agreement between the TVDI and daily rainfall data. The areas with low soil moisture were mainly distributed in coastal areas from 2002 to 2005, but expanded into the middle of the MD in 2006 and 2007. The largest area of low soil moisture was observed in 2006. Classification of rice cropping systems reveals an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for 2002 of 76.3% and 0.68, respectively while the values for 2006 were 76.9% and 0.69, respectively. To relate soil moisture with rice cropping systems, we aggregated the composite soil moisture maps (considering dry and very dry classes only) with the rice crop maps for 2002 and 2006. The results indicate a remarkable increase in the area of double and triple irrigated rice cropping systems in areas of low soil moisture (i.e., dry and very dry conditions) during this period. This study demonstrated the merits of using MODIS data for studying soil variability in relation to rice crops which is important for crop and water management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Only 0 center dot 20-0 center dot 70 of the fertilizer-nitrogen (N) applied to grassland is taken up in herbage in the harvest directly following application. Residual effects at subsequent harvests can be large but are poorly quantified, and rarely taken into account in current management practices. An increased understanding of N-use efficiency per harvest can improve operational management. This study systematically assessed the residual effects of previously applied N fertilizer on N uptake, dry matter (DM) yield and soil mineral-N (SMN) during the whole of the growing season. It is based on field experiments conducted on peat and mineral soils in 1991-1994. Statistical models were derived for SMN, N uptake and DM yield as a function of previously and freshly applied N fertilizer. There were clear residual effects of previously applied N in later cuts. They were relatively greater at higher levels of N fertilizer. On peat soils, 0 center dot 15-0 center dot 25 of the N applied was recovered as SMN. On mineral soils the proportion was maximally 0 center dot 08. There was a clear relationship between SMN and N uptake in the subsequent cut on mineral soils but not on peat soils. The value of SMN as a tool to adjust fertilizer-N application rates was hence found to be limited. There were clear relationships between the amount of previously applied N and the N uptake in subsequent cuts, on both soil types and over the whole of the growing season. It was concluded that the total amount of previously applied N is a useful indicator for adjusting N-fertilizer application rates.

AB  - Improving energy efficiency in tillage is critical for developing sustainable agriculture and mitigating fuel-related CO2 emissions. However, data on energy efficiency and CO2 emissions across various tillage-sowing practices remain scarce in terms of vetch production. The study aimed at evaluating the impact of four tillage-sowing practices (conventional tillage [CT], Reduced-I and II, and no-tillage [NT]) on the fuel consumption, energy productivity, and fuel-related CO2 releases in Hungarian vetch production. The study was performed in Turkey, in semiarid conditions using two water applications (rainfed and irrigated) under two different crop rotations (rainfed: vetch-wheat-fallow and irrigated: vetch-wheat-sunflower). The study findings revealed that while CT had the highest diesel-fuel consumptions (52.2 L/ha in irrigated and 53.1 L/ha in rainfed), the lowest values were determined in NT (16.4 L/ha in irrigated and 16.6 L/ha in rainfed). Total energy requirements were the highest in CT, and determined 11827.4 MJ/ha (5229.1 MJ/ha direct and 10502.5 MJ/ha nonrenewable) in irrigated rotation and 9328.5 MJ/ha (3013.6 MJ/ha direct and 8004.6 MJ/ha nonrenewable) in rainfed conditions. Moreover, CT provided the lowest energy ratio (4.41 in irrigated and 3.87 in rainfed). NT practice required significantly lower total (20.6% in irrigated and 27.8% in rainfed), direct (52.5% in irrigated and 68.8% in rainfed), and nonrenewable energies (23.1% in irrigated and 32.3% in rainfed) and provided higher energy ratio (24.0% in irrigated and 53.2% in rainfed) compared to CT. Irrigation increased energy gain by 48.2% on average. Conservation tillage logarithmically reduced CO2 emissions in both rotations. NT and reduced tillage practices generated 68.7% and 42.2% lower emissions on average compared to CT (151.1 kg CO2/ha), respectively. It was concluded that NT can be a suitable practice to achieve higher energy efficiency and lower CO2 emissions in vetch production. However, reduced tillage can be favorable due to the limited application of NT in most countries.

AB  - Soil tillage systems can be able to influence soil compaction, water dynamics, soil temperature and crop yield. These processes can be expressed as changes of soil microbiological activity, soil respiration and sustainability of agriculture. Objectives of this study were: 1) to assess the effects of tillage systems (conventional system (CS), minimum tillage (MT), no tillage (NT)) on soil compaction, soil temperature, soil moisture and soil respiration and 2) to establish the effect or the changes on the production of wheat, maize and soybean. Five treatments were installed: CS-plough; MT-paraplow, chisel, rotary grape and NT-direct sowing. The study was conducted on an Argic-Stagnic Faeoziom. The MT and NT applications reduce or completely eliminate the soil mobilization, due to this, soil is compacted in the first year of application. The degree of compaction is directly related to soil type and its state of degradation. The state of soil compaction diminished over time, tending toward a specific type of soil density. Soil moisture was higher in NT and MT at the time of sowing and in the early stages of vegetation and differences diminished over time. Moisture determinations showed statistically significant differences. The MT and NT applications reduced the thermal amplitude in the first 15 cm of soil depth and increased the soil temperature by 0.5-2.2 degrees C. Water dynamics and soil temperature showed no differences on the effect of crop yields. The determinations confirm the effect of soil tillage system on soil respiration; the daily average was lower at NT (315-1914 mmol m(-2)s(-1)) and followed by MT (318-2395 mmol m(-2)s(-1)) and was higher in CS (321-2480 mmol m(-2)s(-1)). Comparing with CS, all the four conservation tillage measures decreased soil respiration, with the best effects of no-tillage. Although wheat production at MT and NT applications had no significant differences, soybean production was significantly affected by MT and NT applications. The differences in crop yields were recorded at maize and could be a direct consequence of loosening, mineralization and intensive mobilization of soil fertility.

AB  - Background Agroforestry has been advocated as a climate-smart agricultural approach to counter extreme climate and as an important sustainable intensification practice to meet Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, its efficacy remains under dispute in drylands where resources, especially water, are limited. Aim and methods This study aimed to study how annual bioenergy crops, soybean (Glycine max) and canola (Brassica rapa), influence soil water availability and fine root distribution in a young apple orchard exposed to varying to drought intensity on the semiarid Loess Plateau of China. Drought was simulated by reducing natural precipitation by 15% (moderate drought) and 25% (severe drought). Result and conclusions Intercropping soybean and canola increased the fine root biomass (FRB) of apple trees in the 80-180 cm soil layer, improved moisture status below the 80 cm soil layer in the wet season, and promoted apple tree growth. Under moderate drought, FRB in the 0-80 cm soil layer increased, making use of the shallow soil water replenished by precipitation. However, the trees switched to absorbing soil water in the 80-180 cm in the dry season. Under severe drought, the apple trees increased FRB in the 0-80 cm and 180-280 cm soil layers and increased the proportion of the total roots in the 180-280 cm layer, aggravating the deep soil desiccation and inhibiting apple tree growth. These findings offer insights into drought effects on root plasticity and soil management practices in rainfed orchards.

AB  - Rainfall-induced landslides are a disastrous natural hazard causing loss of life and significant damage to infrastructure, farmland and housing. Hydromechanical models are one way to assess the slope stability and to predict critical combinations of groundwater levels, soil water content and precipitation. However, hydromechanical models for slope stability evaluation require knowledge about mechanical and hydraulic parameters of the soils, lithostratigraphy and morphology. In this work, we present a multi-method approach of site characterization and investigation in combination with a hydromechanical model for a landslide-prone hillslope near Bonn, Germany. The field investigation was used to construct a three-dimensional slope model with major geological units derived from drilling and refraction seismic surveys. Mechanical and hydraulic soil parameters were obtained from previously published values for the study site based on laboratory analysis. Water dynamics were monitored through geoelectrical monitoring, a soil water content sensor network and groundwater stations. Historical data were used for calibration and validation of the hydromechanical model. The well-constrained model was then used to calculate potentially hazardous precipitation events to derive critical thresholds for monitored variables, such as soil water content and precipitation. This work introduces a potential workflow to improve numerical slope stability analysis through multiple data sources from field investigations and outlines the usage of such a system with respect to a site-specific early-warning system.

AB  - Greater precipitation use efficiency (PUE) and economic returns by increasing cropping frequency through the addition of summer crops to the dryland winter wheat-fallow (WF) cropping system have been reported in the semiarid Central Great Plains of USA. However, due to the highly variable nature of precipitation and uncertain water availability, selection of a crop with assured positive net returns to add to the system to increase cropping frequency is a challenge in the absence of reliable seasonal precipitation forecasts. The objective of this study was to evaluate long-term yields and net returns of several potential summer crops at various soil water contents at planting to assess their potential use in increasing dryland cropping frequency. Three grain crops [corn (Zea mays L.), canola (Brassica napus), and proso millet (Panicum miliaceum L.)] and two forage crops [foxtail millet (Setaria italica L Beauv.) and spring triticale (X Triticosecale rimpaui Wittm.)] for which the Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) had been calibrated at Akron, CO and/or Sidney, NE, were selected for investigation through modeling. The calibrated model was used to simulate yield responses of the crops to 25, 50, 75 and 100% of plant available water (PAW) in the soil profile at planting using recorded weather data from Akron, CO and Sidney, NE (1948-2008). Average costs of production and 10-yr average commodity prices for northeast Colorado were used to calculate net returns for each of the crops at the varying PAW levels. All crops showed significant (p < 0.05) simulated yield increases in response to increasing initial PAW levels when those changes occurred in the entire 0-180 cm soil profile. The two forage crops gave greater net returns than the three grain crops for all initial PAW levels when calculated with 10-yr average prices received. Among the grain crops, proso millet was slightly more profitable than corn at Akron, while corn was the least profitable crop at Sidney. Using current commodity prices (13 September 2011) resulted in proso millet being the least profitable crop at Sidney, while corn was the most profitable grain crop at Akron and showed net returns that were similar to those found for the forage crops. The results of this study may guide the selection of a spring- or summer-planted crop and help farmers assess risk as they contemplate intensifying the WF system by using a measure or estimate of PAW at planting.

AB  - Tibetan Plateau Vortices (TPVs) are important synoptic systems that affect precipitation over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and downstream weather. By using daily reanalysis data provided by ECMWF and the objective identification methods, the study identified the basic spatiotemporal changes of TPVs, clustered the TPVs by different dynamic circulation types and explored the dynamic circulation background of the classified TPVs in the midwestern TP and their relationship with thermal factors, such as sensible heat and soil moisture. The results show that TPVs in the midwestern TP exhibited an increasing trend from May to August, resulting from the coupling of dynamics with thermal forcing. The related synoptic circulations were divided into four types according to the dynamic circulations: the shortwave trough, the longwave trough, the shear line and the plateau anticyclone type. Among the TPVs, the percentage of TPVs in the shortwave and longwave trough type was relatively large, accounting for 48.7% and 31.5%, respectively, both of which were dominated by the coupling of increased sensible heat and decreased soil moisture. The shear line type was less affected by thermal factors, and mainly driven by dynamic factors, whereas the soil moisture gradient was responsible for the plateau anticyclone type. The simulation experiment also proved this conclusion.

AB  - Liu, K., Hammermeister, A. M., Warman, P. R., Drury, C. F. and Martin, R. C. 2011. Assessing soil nitrogen availability in contrasting cropping systems at the end of transition to organic production. Can. J. Soil Sci. 91: 493-501. Quantifying soil nitrogen (N) availability at the end of a transition period for converting conventional fields to organic fields could enhance N management during the subsequent organic crop production phase. Soil total N (N(tot)), KCI extractable N (KCI N) and potentially mineralizable N (N(o)) were determined at the end of a 3-yr transition period. A complementary greenhouse ryegrass N bioassay was conducted using soils collected from the treated field plots. The field experiment consisted of six cropping systems comprising two N inputs (legume-based vs. manure-based) and three forage cropping treatments (0, 1 or 2 yr of forage in 4-yr rotations). The N input treatments consisted of alfalfa meal in the legume-based cropping system (LBCS) and composted beef manure in the manure-based cropping system (MBCS). Orthogonal contrasts suggested no differences in N(tot) or KCI N either between LBCS and MBCS or between no-forage and forage cropping systems. However, in the greenhouse study, high cumulative N inputs in the MBCS resulted in significantly higher ryegrass N uptake and potentially mineralizable soil N than in the LBCS. Ryegrass N uptake ranged from 101 to 139 kg ha(-1), which should be an adequate N supply for the succeeding potato crop. In the greenhouse, a ryegrass N bioassay effectively identified the differences in soil N availability. Ryegrass N uptake was linearly related to cumulative soil amendment N inputs but had no apparent relationship with N(o). A systems approach provided a good assessment of N availability at the end of the transition period to organic production.

AB  - Water management is a key factor to optimize fruit quality and yield of processing tomatoes which are site-specific and influenced by environmental conditions e.g., soil, temperature, precipitation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacity of a low-cost wireless soil moisture sensor in determining the irrigation level for optimizing the marketable yield, fruit quality and economic profit of processing tomato. A two-years (2017-2018) trial was conducted in open field, applying nine drip irrigation levels controlled by wireless soil moisture capacitance sensors. The irrigation levels were as follows: 13.2, 16.7, 25.4, 33.3, 50.0, 62.3, 82.5, 100 and 186.8% of water restitution based on soil moisture sensor readings. Because of the crop stress induced by heavy rainfalls occurring in 2018 growing season, total and marketable yields reached higher maximum values in 2017 than 2018. In 2017, total and marketable yields were maximized by supplying 92.8% and 96.2% of irrigation level, respectively. Moreover, 95.6% and 91.2% of irrigation level were necessary in 2018 to maximize total and marketable yield, respectively. In both growing seasons, marketable yield variation was due to changes of both fruit number and fruit mean weight. Total soluble solids of fruit juice linearly decreased by increasing the irrigation level with a more pronounced effect in the driest growing season (2017). Economic analysis demonstrated that 100% of irrigation level should be preferred by the Italian farmers since it maximized the operating margins of processing tomatoes in both years. To conclude, the use of the tested low-cost wireless soil moisture sensor is an effective tool to manage the level of irrigation and optimize the processing tomato yield and economic benefits for farmers.

AB  - Shallow landslide failures are distributed worldwide and cause economic losses and fatalities. A proper evaluation of the possible occurrence of shallow landslides requires reliable characterization of water content. Volumetric water content (theta) is commonly estimated using dielectric sensors, which use manufacturers' calibration curves developed for specific soil types. In this study, we present the experimental results achieved during a laboratory calibration of a capacitance probe (PR2/6 probe), tested on two sandy soils widely outcropping in Central Italy. The proposed equations demonstrate a more reliable estimation of theta with respect to the generalized soil equation provided by the manufacturer, which overestimates theta by up to 10 percentage points. Such overestimation could affect the evaluation of suction stress in partially saturated shallow soils affecting the slope stability analysis. Although the use of theta from correct calibration equations provides less precautionary factor of safety values, a reliable evaluation of the soil moisture condition is fundamental when mapping and predicting the spatial and temporal occurrence of shallow landslides. The use of the PR2/6 probe with the appropriate soil calibration equations in early warning monitoring systems will provide a more reliable forecast, minimizing the number of false alarms.

AB  - Production of Conilon coffee under organic management systems has increased in the State of Espirito Santo, Brazil. However, information is lacking in regard to the impact of these management practices on soil carbon and nitrogen stocks. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of organic fertilization on C and N stocks and soil bulk density (Bd) in a Conilon coffee agrosystem. A field experiment was carried out in Linhares, ES, in a randomized block design in a 2 x 2 x 5 factorial arrangement, with three replications. The factors were: two organic composts; presence and absence of the jackbean legume between the rows; and five different proportions of each organic compost (0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 %) to substitute the recommended mineral fertilization. Each replicate consisted of 30 coffee plants. Soil samples were collected under the canopy of each plant. The organic composts were compound 1, prepared from elephant grass and coffee straw in a 1: 1 ratio (v:v); and compound 2, prepared from elephant grass, coffee straw, and chicken litter in a 2: 1: 1 ratio (v: v: v). Soil samples were taken 240 days after fertilization (240DAF) in the 1st crop year and 30 days after the 1st stage of fertilization (30DAF) in the 2nd crop year. The use of organic compounds to fertilize coffee led to a decrease in Bd of approximately 13 %. The increase in the proportion of organic compounds in fertilization increased the content and stock of C and N in the soil at 30 days after fertilization in the 2nd crop year. There were increases of 11 and 0.4 Mg ha(-1) for the stock of C and N, respectively, for coffee plants fertilized with 100 % of compound 1, in relation to mineral fertilization. Fertilization with organic compounds is an alternative for increasing C and N stocks in agrosystems of conilon coffee.

AB  - Understanding of soil phosphorus (P) transformation is crucial to minimize its edge-of-field loss associated with ecosystem disservices. A sequential chemical extraction procedure was used to assess the impact (42 years) of organic and chemical fertilizations on soil P partition and distribution under subtropical rice based cropping systems. Experimental treatments were control, N, NP, NK, NS, NZn, NPK, NSZn, NPKSZn, and N+FYM (farmyard manure). Composite soils were collected from 0-5, 20-25 and 40-45 cm depths, extracted, and analyzed for soluble P, NaHCO3-P (inorganic and organic), NaOH-P (inorganic and organic), acid soluble (H2SO4), and residual P fractions. The NPKSZn significantly increased the concentration of soil inorganic P compared to other treatments. When FYM was applied together with N fertilizer, the organic P concentration increased, which was statistically identical to NPKSZn and NPK treatments. While the labile (NaHCO3-Pi, NaOH-Po), residual, and total P concentrations were stratified at 0-5 cm depth, the concentration of NaHCO3-Po, NaOH-Pi, and acidic P fractions increased with soil depth. The soluble, NaHCO3 (Pi and Po), NaOH-Pi and NaOH-Po, acidic, and residual P fractions constituted about 0.4, 6.6, 1.7, 21.3, 37.7, and 8.3%, respectively, of the total P. A higher concentration of the labile P at the surface soil indicated that the impact of chemical fertilization stratified the available P for plant uptake or susceptible to edge-of-field loss. The NPKSZn and N+FYM both had higher NaHCO3-Po and NaOH-Po concentrations within 40-45 cm and 0-25 cm depths, suggesting that N+FYM could promote the transformation of non-labile P into labile P pool, by reducing P fixation by soil and transport them at 20-45 cm depth. It is concluded that long-term fertilization increased the concentration of P pools especially labile P by saturating the soil adsorption sites especially in surface soil.

AB  - The wetting pattern which occurs under surface drip irrigation is an important component for the optimum design of the system and for irrigation programming. The aim of this investigation was to devise a model which enables estimation of the 2D cross-sectional area of the wetting pattern which occurs under a surface dripper by an analytical method. The main parameters of the wetting pattern are the wetting diameter on the soil surface, the maximum wetted depth and maximum wetted width in the soil profile, and the depth of this maximum wetted width from the soil surface. In the laboratory experiments, water applications were carried out on two soil textures (clay loam and clay) with homogeneous soil profiles at two discharge rates over 125 min and 170 min periods. The sizes of the parameters of the wetting pattern were measured as consecutive series over 5-min intervals during the water application period. The general/main shape which represents the wetting patterns which occur under different irrigation conditions was defined and mathematically modelled. When the results were evaluated statistically, a correlation of 0.9128 was found between the momentary rates of change of the maximum depth of the wetting pattern predicted by the model and those measured in the experiment. The correlation between the momentary variations of accelerations of the same parameter was 0.9205. In addition, the size of the wetting pattern showed an increment in reducing velocities during the water application period. The results indicate that the model devised in this investigation can be used in the prediction of the cross-sectional area of the wetting pattern which occurs under a surface dripper.

AB  - . Much of the research on irrigation scheduling sensors, especially soil water sensors, assesses and refines the accuracy of sensor calibrations. However, a sensor with an accurate calibration but high variability among replicates may require a larger-than-acceptable number of replicates for informing recommendations of optimal irrigation timing. To compare the interreplicate variability of sensors across types and calibration accuracy levels, this study presented eight metrics: (1) absolute spread-to-change ratio, (2) shifted spread-to-change ratio, (3) coefficient of change variation, (4) standard deviation of relative value, (5) standard deviation of relative change, (6) standard deviation of absolute triggering date, (7) standard deviation of shifted triggering date, and (8) standard deviation of relative triggering date. These metrics enabled comparisons either by nondimensionalizing sensor measurements or by expressing interreplicate variability in terms of time. For demonstrating their usage and their particularities, the metrics were applied to two datasets that included soil water sensor types such as neutron probe (503DR), dielectric sensor (TDR-315, CS616, CS655, HydraProbe II, 5TE, TEROS 12, Drill & Drop), and granular matrix sensor (Watermark 200SS). The neutron probe in the single-depth dataset and the granular matrix sensor in the multi-depth dataset generally displayed less interreplicate variability than other evaluated sensor types over multiple drying cycles. Future research is suggested to calculate and improve the eight metrics for identifying combinations of sensor types, deployment methods, and data interpretation techniques that minimize interreplicate variability and maximize irrigation scheduling precision.

AB  - SCoBi-Veg stands for Signals of opportunity Coherent Bistatic scattering model for Vegetated terrains. It simulates polarimetric reflectometry of vegetation canopy over a flat ground using a Monte Carlo scheme. The model is aimed at assessing the value of navigation and communication satellite Signals of Opportunity in a range of frequencies from P-to S-bands for remote sensing of a number of geophysical land parameters such as soil moisture and biomass. A fully polarimetric expression for bistatic scattering from a vegetation canopy is first formulated for a general case and is then specialized to the practical case of ground-based/low-altitude platforms with passive receivers overlooking vegetation using the signals transmitted from large distances. Using analytical wave theory in conjunction with distorted Born approximation, the transmit and receive antenna effects (i.e., polarization crosstalk/mismatch, orientation, and altitude) are explicitly accounted for. The forward model developed here enables the understanding of the effect of different geophysical parameters and system configurations on the coherent and incoherent components of the reflected signatures. It can thus help developing robust inverse algorithm for extraction of soil moisture and biomass. The model is applied to P-band signals of geostationary communication satellites to describe polarimetric reflections from tree canopies as observed from down-looking platforms at various altitudes. The relative contributions of diffuse and specular scattering on total reflected power and reflectivity are quantified for various observing scenarios.

AB  - To improve hydrological predictions, real-time measurements derived from traditional physical sensors are integrated within mathematic models. Recently, traditional sensors are being complemented with crowdsourced data (social sensors). Although measurements from social sensors can be low cost and more spatially distributed, other factors like spatial variability of citizen involvement, decreasing involvement over time, variable observations accuracy and feasibility for model assimilation play an important role in accurate flood predictions. Only a few studies have investigated the benefit of assimilating uncertain crowdsourced data in hydrological and hydraulic models. In this study, we investigate the usefulness of assimilating crowdsourced observations from a heterogeneous network of static physical, static social and dynamic social sensors. We assess improvements in the model prediction performance for different spatial-temporal scenarios of citizen involvement levels. To that end, we simulate an extreme flood event that occurred in the Bacchiglione catchment (Italy) in May 2013 using a semi-distributed hydrological model with the station at Ponte degli Angeli (Vicenza) as the prediction-validation point. A conceptual hydrological model is implemented by the Alto Adriatico Water Authority and it is used to estimate runoff from the different sub-catchments, while a hydraulic model is implemented to propagate the flow along the river reach. In both models, a Kalman filter is implemented to assimilate the crowdsourced observations. Synthetic crowdsourced observations are generated for either static social or dynamic social sensors because these measures were not available at the time of the study. We consider two sets of experiments: (i) assuming random probability of receiving crowdsourced observations and (ii) using theoretical scenarios of citizen motivations, and consequent involvement levels, based on population distribution. The results demonstrate the usefulness of integrating crowdsourced observations. First, the assimilation of crowdsourced observations located at upstream points of the Bacchiglione catchment ensure high model performance for high lead-time values, whereas observations at the outlet of the catchments provide good results for short lead times. Second, biased and inaccurate crowdsourced observations can significantly affect model results. Third, the theoretical scenario of citizens motivated by their feeling of belonging to a "community of friends" has the best effect in the model performance. However, flood prediction only improved when such small communities are located in the upstream portion of the Bacchiglione catchment. Finally, decreasing involvement over time leads to a reduction in model performance and consequently inaccurate flood forecasts.

AB  - Rolling/crimping technology has been utilized to mechanically terminate cover crops in conservation agriculture. In the southeastern United States, to eliminate competition for valuable soil moisture, three weeks are typically required after rolling to plant a cash crop into the desiccated cover crop residue. A common method to enhance the cover crop termination is a supplemental application of herbicides such as glyphosate. However, synthetic herbicides cannot be used in organic production, thus additional rolling operations might speed the desiccation process. On the other hand, recurrent rolling/crimping operations could cause additional soil compaction, which could be detrimental for water infiltration and crop root development. The objectives of this experiment were to determine the effectiveness of a single-stage roller with straight bars and a new two-stage roller in terminating either rye (Secale cereale L) or a mixture of rye, crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L), and hairy vetch (Vicia villosa L) with repeated rolling operations, and the effect of repeated rolling on volumetric soil water content and soil strength. Cover crop termination dates were selected three weeks before planting date recommendations for vegetables in the northern Alabama region. In three growing seasons (2007, 2008, 2009), three weeks after rolling, both roller designs effectively terminated rye > 90%, which is above the recommended rye termination rate to plant a cash crop. No difference in termination rates were observed between two rollers. Rolling two or three times did not cause additional soil compaction, and rolled residue reduced soil strength compared to standing cover crops due to an improved termination rate and associated moisture conservation. Soil volumetric moisture content (VMC) after repeated rolling operations was significantly higher compared with standing rye and mixture covers. In the mixture, hairy vetch was actively growing two weeks after rolling even after three rolling operations, most likely due to too early growth stage for hairy vetch. Repeated rolling can be beneficial for faster mechanical termination of cover crops such as rye and crimson clover, but may not be adequate for mixtures that include hairy vetch.

AB  - The use of different cropping systems affects soil phosphorus (P) availability. Microbes play a main role in regulating soil P cycling. Currently, there is a knowledge gap on the effects of the long-term use of different crop rotation systems on microbial functional genes involved in P cycling on soil P availability. In this study, metagenomics was used to determine microbial functional genes involved in P cycling in a 12-year experiment that included three crop rotation systems: wheat-maize rotation (WM), wheat-cotton rotation (WC), and wheat-soybean rotation (WS). WS had a significantly higher AP content than WC (37.3%) and WM (41.5%). Further analysis of the soil microbial population showed that WS mainly enriched the abundance of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes from the phylum to genus levels. For the P-cycling genes, WS significantly increased the P-cycling gene abundance of organic P mineralization (phoD, phnA, and phnP) compared with WC and WM. WC enhanced the microbial function of the Inorganic P solubilization genes gcd and gppa. WM enhanced the function of polyphosphate degradation, and the abundance of genes spoT and ppnK was significantly increased in WM soil compared with WC and WS soil. In addition, our structural equation model and network analysis showed that the organic P mineralization gene abundance had a significant effect on the available P content; the effect coefficients were 0.73, and the organic P mineralization genes phoD, phnA, and phnP, which were enriched in WS soil, were keystone genes in the process of increasing the soil-available P. Our results highlight the relationship between P cycle functions and cropping systems, which also has implications for enhancing P availability through the use of different crop systems in agricultural production.

AB  - Tomatoes, one of the most appreciated vegetables consumed, are crops well adapted for cultivation in arid and semi-arid conditions, with the success of large yields guaranteed by covering water consumption through irrigation. Solar Pumps-SP are driven by Photovoltaic Panels-PV (SPAPV), eliminating the dependence on electricity or diesel; they are environmentally friendly because they generate carbon-free electricity, and the cost of operation and maintenance is lower. In order to preserve the water administered by drip to the tomato crop grown in solariums, mulching is used. In Husasau de Tinca, in the Crisurilor Plain, the cultivation of tomato varieties without mulching (WM) and with mulching with black foil (MBF) was studied. To answer the question "How effective are water conservation measures in terms of energy independence?", two variants of SPAPVs, direct pumping (ADP) and storage tank (AST) were simulated. It is proposed to determine the water consumption of tomatoes (ETRo), using the temperatures inside the solarium. In 2016, the average temperatures during the vegetation period with insurance of over 20%, were observed. The specific investment (SI) is 214,795 Euro ha(-1) in the case of ADP and respectively 202,990 Euro ha(-1) in the case of ATS. The payback period (IPT) is between 2.68 years and 2.53 years for the ADP variant and between 1.63 years and 1.54 years for the ATS variant. The indications for water use and irrigation water use show that in the MBF variant, the water administered by localized irrigation is better utilized than in the WM variant. The novelty of this study is the evaluation of the effectiveness of measures to reduce the effects of global climate change on tomatoes grown in solariums, useful for forecasting and watering restrictions, water consumption is determined from the air temperature measured inside the solarium, with insurance of over 20%. Taking into account the working hypotheses, the distribution of irrigation water in the solarium, with the help of SPAPVs, for tomatoes grown in the MBF variant, and a drip irrigation arrangement with ATS, the energy independence of the farm is ensured, the yields obtained are economically efficient, and the irrigation water is used rationally.

AB  - Projected changes to rainfall patterns may exacerbate existing risks posed by flooding. Furthermore, increased surface runoff from agricultural land increases pollution through nutrient losses. Agricultural systems are complex because they are managed in individual fields, and it is impractical to provide resources to monitor their water fluxes. In this respect, modelling provides an inexpensive tool for simulating fluxes. At the field-scale, a daily time-step is used routinely. However, it was hypothesised that a finer time-step will provide more accurate identification of peak fluxes. To investigate this, the process-based SPACSYS model that simulates water fluxes, soil carbon and nitrogen cycling, as well as plant growth, with a daily time-step was adapted to provide sub-daily simulations. As a case study, the water flux simulations were checked against a 15-minute measured water flux dataset from April 2013 to February 2016 from a pasture within a monitored grassland research farm, where the data were up-scaled to hourly, 6-hourly and daily. Analyses were conducted with respect to model performance for: (a) each of the four data resolutions, separately (15-minute measured versus 15-minute simulated; hourly measured versus hourly simulated; etc.); and (b) at the daily resolution only, where 15-minute, hourly and 6hourly simulations were each aggregated to the daily scale. Comparison between measured and simulated fluxes at the four resolutions revealed that hourly simulations provided the smallest misclassification rate for identifying water flux peaks. Conversely, aggregating to the daily scale using either 15-minute or hourly simulations increased accuracy, both in prediction of general trends and identification of peak fluxes. For the latter investigation, the improved identification of extremes resulted in 9 out of 11 peak flow events being correctly identified with only 2 false positives, compared with 5 peaks being identified with 4 false positives of the usual daily simulations. Increased peak flow detection accuracy has the potential to provide clear field management benefits in reducing nutrient losses to water.

AB  - Oilseed and pulse crops have been increasingly used to replace conventional summer fallow and diversify cropping systems in northern high latitude areas. The knowledge of water use (WU) and its distribution profile in the soil is essential for optimizing cropping systems aimed at improving water use efficiency (WUE). This study characterized water use and distribution profile for pulse and oilseed crops compared to spring wheat (Triticum aestiuum L.) in a semiarid environment. Three oilseeds [canola (Brassica napus L.), mustard (Brassica juncea L.) and flax (Linum usitatissimum L.)], three pulses [chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), dry pea (Pisum sativum L.) and lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.)], and spring wheat were seeded in removable 100 cm deep x 15 cm diameter lysimeters placed in an Aridic Haploboroll soil, in southwest Saskatchewan in 2006 and 2007. Crops were studied under rainfed and irrigated conditions where lysimeters were removed and sampled for plant biomass and WU at various soil depths. Wheat yields were greater than pulse crop yields which were greater than oilseed yields, and WUE averaged 4.08 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for pulse crops, 3.64 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for oilseeds, and ranged between 5.5 and 7.0 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) for wheat. Wheat used water faster than pulse and oilseed crops with crop growth. Pulse crops extracted water mostly from the upper 60 cm soil depths, and left more water unused in the profile at maturity compared to oilseeds or wheat. Among the three pulses, lentil used the least amount of water and appeared to have a shallower rooting depth than chickpea and dry pea. Soil WU and distribution profile under canola and mustard were generally similar; both using more water than flax. Differences in WU and distribution profile were similar for crops grown under rainfall and irrigation conditions. A deep rooting crop grown after pulses may receive more benefits from water conservation in the soil profile than when grown after oilseed or wheat. Alternating pulse crops with oilseeds or wheat in a well-planned crop sequence may improve WUE for the entire cropping systems in semiarid environments. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Y Harvesting floodwaters to recharge depleted groundwater aquifers can simultaneously reduce flood and drought risks and enhance groundwater sustainability. However, deployment of this multibeneficial adaptation option is fundamentally constrained by how much water is available for recharge (WAFR) at present and under future climate change. Here, we develop a climate- informed and policy-relevant framework to quantify WAFR, its uncertainty, and associated policy actions. Despite robust and widespread increases in future projected WAFR in our case study of California (for 56/80% of subbasins in 2070-2099 under RCP4.5/RCP8.5), strong nonlinear interactions between diversion infrastructure and policy uncertainties constrain how much WAFR can be captured. To tap future elevated recharge potential through infrastructure expansion under deep uncertainties, we outline a novel robustness-based policy typology to identify priority areas of investment needs. Our WAFR analysis can inform effective investment decisions to adapt to future climate-fueled drought and flood risk over depleted aquifers, in California and beyond.

AB  - The increase in agricultural production over the last decades has required an excessive use of nutrients, notably phosphorus (P). The phosphorus surplus (P-surplus) transferred to hydrosystems represents a source of potential harm to the environment, particularly in terms of water pollution (e.g. eutrophication). In this study, a soil surface budget was used to calculate P-surplus as the difference between inputs from mineral fertilizer, manure and atmospheric deposition and outputs represented by various types of harvested crops. P-surplus was quantified yearly between 1920 and 2020 for 90 geographic entities in France, called departments. National mean P-surplus calculated over the 1920-2020 period was 6 kg P per hectare of utilized agricultural area (ha UAA). At the departmental scale, the 1920-2020 average ranged from - 25 to 62 kg P ha UAA(-1). Annual imprecisions linked to P-surplus were also quantified for each department as the difference between the 1st and 9th decile of 200 Monte Carlo simulations. The average departmental imprecision was 4 kg P ha UAA(-1) year(-1). These uncertainties are mainly related to P content in crops (R-2 = 0.67). Despite these imprecisions, this study assessed trends in P-surplus and determined key-drivers responsible for surplus changes. Indeed, changes in surplus were similar in all the departments for the period 1920-1974, characterized by surplus increase with a maximum in 1974 and by a surplus decline since then. This decrease was clearly related to the decline of mineral fertilizer use in most departments.

AB  - THE MAXIMUM requirement of primary nutrients by hybrid maize crop deteriorate the fertility of soil, therefore farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with mineral zinc (Zn) and phosphorus (P) was selected for the increasing crop productivity, rehabilitate and sustain the precious soil. The research was carried out at the farm of the university of Agriculture Peshawar (UAP)during year 2019-20.To investigate the impact of mineral P from di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and Zn from zinc sulphate (ZnSO4) in combination with FYM on maize yield. The experiment was carried out in randomized completed block design (RCND) having eight different combinations of FYM, P and Zn were used excluding control. Spring hybrid variety of maize (CS-200) was used as a test crop. Basal dosage of nitrogen (N) 120 and potassium (K) 60 kg ha(-1) were also applied. Physio-chemical properties of soil and concentration of Zn, P and K in maize leaves at silking stage and post harvested stage were measured. The objectives of this study was to determine the impact of FYM, P and (Zn) alone and in combination on yield of maize and soil properties and to gives best combination of organic fertilizers with mineral. From this research it was concluded that the combine application mineral P and Zn with FYM have linearly influenced the thousand grains weight, grain and biological yield of hybrid maize (CS- 200). The combine used of P and FYM @ of 90 kg ha(-1) and 10 ton ha(-1) shows influential impact on 1000 grains weight and grain yield, respectively. The soil organic matter and total N were significantly (P <= 0.05) influenced by FYM applied alone, whereas the uptake of N, P and K by hybrid maize crop was found maximum in the plot where P in combination with FYM was added. Based on results the application of FYM @ 10 t ha(-1) applied with 90 kg ha(-1) have the potential to improve maize yield as well as soil fertility and physical condition, also enhance the plant nutrient uptake and yield of hybrid maize, while the concentration of zinc in soil and plant were also greatly affected by the applied treatment. It shows antagonistic effect with P and its concentration become linearly decreased with the increase in P rates, while the maximum Zn concentration was showed by the sole application of zinc fertilizer.

AB  - La Montana region, in southern Mexico, is characterized as a highly human-modified landscape with a rough topography, extreme poverty and structural violence. In this region, Xuajin Me'Phaa, an Indigenous non-governmental organization conformed by ca. 300 peasants, implements productive restoration projects and trades organic hibiscus (Hibiscus sabdariffa L.) as its main monetary income. Nonetheless currently, organic hibiscus yield is low compared to the potential yields in the region. Thus, it is necessary to explore alternative sustainable land management systems which enable farmers to increase hibiscus crop productivity, while halting land degradation. This study assessed the impact of six different agroecological fertilization protocols (AFPs) on hibiscus productivity planted in an alley cropping system with Calliandra houstoniana trees. The AFPs were based on the combination of three local plant amendments: C. houstoniana mulch, Mucuna pruiriens var. utilis green manure and hibiscus stover, and a commercial bio-fertilizer (Azospirillum + Rhizophagus). Simultaneously, the performance of C. houstoniana trees was assessed. The AFPs were applied in the alley cropping system and evaluated from 2016 to 2018. After 3 years, in the AFPs which included C. houstoniana mulch, hibiscus yielded significantly more (419 +/- 27 kg dry calyxes ha(-1) in average) than AFPs which did not include this species (264 +/- 15 kg ha(-1)). The 18-month-old C. houstoniana trees yielded 0.6 t ha(-1) of dry biomass and 1.12 t ha(-1) of wooden stakes, a relatively low production. In conclusion, our results show that alley cropping with a denser arrangement of C. houstoniana trees in combination with mulching of this tree species, and use of mucuna green manure represent a promising agroforestry system for organic hibiscus production.

AB  - Incorporation of crop residues into agricultural system has become a worldwide efficient practice for enhancing crop production. The main objectives of this experiment was to investigate the major role of incorporating wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residues and nitrogen (N) fertilizers rates under different water requirements (WR) on growth, seed yield and yield components of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.). The results showed that seed yield under 80% WR in retained crop residue plots was & SIM;11% higher than WR treatment with no residue incorporation. Seed yield was not significantly different between residue retention and removal treatments in 2016, whereas it was higher (12% and 17%) under residue retained plots compared to removed ones in subsequent years. Seed yields responded to N up to 170 and 225 kg ha(-1) in removed and retained residue treatments, respectively in 2017 and 2018. Annual increment of seed yield in residue retained plots (36%) was 2.11 times higher than the residue removed ones (17%). There was higher soil N content in 50% residue retention with 225 kg N ha(-1) under both water deficit treatments in all years. The highest soil organic carbon (SOC) was achieved with normal irrigation in retained residue plots with 225 kg N ha(-1) in all years. Overall, wheat residue incorporation into the soil and N-supply substantially contributed to counteracting yield declines of common bean under water deficit conditions.& nbsp;(c) 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) treatment devices are often used to restore natural drainage properties in developed catchments. WSUD can make positive contributions to the restoration of natural ecosystem processes, by supporting trees and habitats in urban areas without taking up limited urban space. This paper reports on the development and testing of a new WSUD device, the Wicking Tank. It is designed to supply sufficient volumes of water to urban trees through periods of drought via synthetic wicks from an underground storage tank to support adequate tree health. Relying on gravity fed stormwater, and the natural capillarity, adhesion, and cohesion properties of water and the process of hydraulic redistribution, water is transferred from the tank and into the rhizosphere of the tree. Water demand is controlled passively by the water potential differential across the root zone. Proof of concept testing of the Wicking Tank has shown the device to successfully draw water into soil to support the ongoing survival of a potted plant for over 20 weeks. Substantial differences are anticipated between this proof of concept test and an in-situ field trial. A field-based demonstration style version of the Wicking Tank is planned for construction and testing in 2015.

AB  - In Northern China, vegetables are usually grown in solar greenhouses using intensive fertilization and cultivation, which produces significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to the atmosphere. In this study, the nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from 12 solar greenhouses with different fertilization practices (without manure application (SG); with chicken (SG-CM) or swine (SG-SM) manure application) were measured in the southern Loess Plateau of China during the summer fallow (35-61 days) in 2013 and 2014. The daily N2O fluxes varied over the ranges of 0.002-0.041, 0.014-12.58, and 0.005-8.41 mg N m(-2) h(-1) with averages of 0.037, 0.81, and 1.70 mg N m(-2) h(-1) in the SG, SG-CM, and SG-SM greenhouses, respectively, and the total N2O emissions were 1.17, 12.0, and 16.0 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Significantly high peak N2O emissions were observed at the beginning of the summer fallow and after manure application, accounting for more than 80% of the total N2O emissions. The management practices of polythene removal, greenhouse enclosure for a week, and tillage also significantly increased the N2O daily fluxes and total emissions. Linear regression analyses showed that soil moisture and manure application were the main factors controlling the N2O emissions during summer fallow, followed by the residual mineral N in the soil. The results indicated that solar greenhouses cause high N2O emissions during summer fallow and farmers should use appropriate measures to mitigate these emissions.

AB  - Overuse of phosphorus (P) fertilizer and the resulting soil P accumulation in vegetable production increases the risk of P runoff and leaching. However, P transformations under continuous fertilization and their effects on environmental risk are unclear. The current study examined the effects of long-term P fertilizer application on P fractions in different soil layers, and assessed the correlations between P fractions and environmental risks in intensive vegetable production in a subtropical region. A total of 32 fields were studied, including 8 uncultivated fields and 24 fields continuously used for vegetable production for 1-3, 4-9, or 10-15 years. The results showed that excessive P fertilizer input caused soil P surpluses ranging from 204.6 to 252.4 kg ha(-1) yr(-1). Compared to uncultivated fields, vegetable fields contained higher levels of labile P, moderately labile P, sparingly labile P, and non-labile P. The combined percentage of labile P and moderately labile P increased from 55.2% in fields cultivated for 0-3 year to 65.5% in fields cultivated for 10-15 years. The concentrations of soil P fractions were higher at 0-20 cm soil depth than at 20-40 and 40-60 cm soil depth. Soil available P was positively correlated with all soil P fractions except diluted HCI-P-i or concentrated HCI-P-o. Long-term vegetable production increased CaCl2-P downward movement, which was positively correlated with levels of labile and moderately labile P. The P index indicated a high risk of P losses from the vegetable fields. The P index was on average 3.27-fold higher in the vegetable fields than in uncultivated fields, and was significantly correlated with soil available P and organic and inorganic P fertilizer input. The environmental risk caused by P in vegetable production should be reduced by reducing P fertilizer input so as to maintain soil available P within an optimal range for vegetable production.

AB  - Famines have long been associated with drought. With the severity of droughts growing in association with climate change, there is increasing pressure to do a better job predicting famines and delivering international aid to avert human suffering and civil instability. We examine recent advances in remote sensing technology, focusing on the latency, historical availability and spatial and temporal scales of the data these satellites provide. Because of their global coverage, seven variables derived from satellite observations emerge as especially pertinent to drought and famine: precipitation (TRMM/GPM), groundwater (GRACE/GRACE-FO), snow (MODIS), soil moisture (SMOS, SMAP, Sentinel-1), evapotranspiration (MODIS, ECOSTRESS), vegetation health (Landsat, AVHRR, MODIS, SPOT) and chlorophyll fluorescence (OCO-2). We discuss tipping point theory as a possible framework for taking advantage of long time series of these satellite data where they exist in order to enhance the effectiveness of existing famine early warning systems.

AB  - Greenhouse and field-grown 'Seyval blanc' grapevines (vitis sp.) were grown with low-growing, shallow-rooted, mat-forming, ornamental perennial groundcovers, and the effect of the groundcovers on the vegetative and fruiting growth of the grapevines was evaluated. The groundcovers used in this experiment were 'Kentucky-31' tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea); white mazus (Mazus japoonicus albus); english pennyroyal (Menthapulegium); dwarf creeping thyme (Thymus serpyllum minus); strawberry clover (Trifolium fragiferum); 'Heavenly Blue' veronica (Veronica prostrata 'Heavenly Blue'); and a companion grass mixture of 75% perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne) and 25% red fescue (Festuca rubra). A control treatment grown without any groundcover was also used in both the greenhouse and field experiments. All of the groundcovers reduced 'Seyval blanc' total shoot length from 22% to 85% in the vineyard. Cluster size was reduced in the field from 7% to 68% by the groundcovers compared to the herbicide control treatment, and from 9% to 66% in the greenhouse experiment, but none of the groundcovers in either the greenhouse or field experiments affected the pH, total acidity, or soluble solids concentrations of the 'Seyval blanc' juice. English pennyroyal was the only groundcover that reduced in the leaf area of the grapevine. Single-leaf photosynthesis of the 'Seyval blanc' grapevines in the field experiment was reduced by all groundcovers except mazus and creeping thyme. Water infiltration rates were 10 to 50 times higher in the groundcovers compared to the bare soil of the herbicide control treatment. Weed growth in the field caused reduction in shoot length similar to the most competitive groundcovers. Weed growth was reduced in the early season by the english pennyroyal and companion grass, and in the late season by all groundcovers. The reduction in growth of the grapevines caused by groundcovers in the greenhouse was a reasonable screen for the affect of groundcovers in the field. The mazus treatment was the only groundcover in our experiments that coupled fast growth with low competitive ability.

AB  - Phosphorus can be removed successfully from dairy wastewater using Al- or Fe-water treatment residuals (Al-WTR, Fe-WTR). Understanding the characteristics of P-sorbing pools can facilitate reuse of the newly formed organic composites (WW-Al/O-WTR, WW-Fe/O-WTR) as fertilizers. Phosphorus fractionation in heterogenic materials requires a specific composition of chemical extractants. The SEDEX protocol suited the Fe-WTR, but the Al-WTR required a modified protocol that focused on the Al-bound pool. Both fractionation protocols express similar pools consisting of the labile-, the major tri-valent (hydr)oxides-, moderately- and strongly Ca associated-P pools. The modified Al-WTR sequential P extraction protocol allows for differentiation between inorganic P (Pi) versus organic P pools, including most labile P, P bound onto Al (hydr)oxide surfaces, Fe (hydr)oxide- and humic substances (HS)-bound, moderately labile Ca-bound, strongly Ca-bound, and residual occluded P. The strongly Ca-bound P constituted 65% of P in the original Al-WTR. Following mixing with dairy wastewater, this pool became 40% of the P in WW-Al/O-WTR, while surface Al (hydr)oxide and moderately labile Ca fractions became larger (33% and 19% Pi, respectively). Organic P was mainly associated with the moderately labile Ca-bound (68%) fraction, and only 25% was strongly bound to Fe and HS. The predominating P pool on Fe-WTR was Fe (hydr)oxides (61%), with a similar fraction of labile and CaCO3 bound P (about 16%). Mixing Fe-WTR with dairy wastewater significantly increased P bound to Fe (hydr)oxides and labile P, and decreased P pools associated with Ca (ca. 62, 30 and < 6% respectively). These sequential extractions demonstrated the heterogenic behavior of P sorption in WTR materials and that mixing Al- and Fe-WTR with WW will form moderately labile P pools, enhancing the potential to reuse these waste materials as P fertilizers.

AB  - Near-surface soil moisture content variation is a major factor in the frequent shallow slope failures observed on Mississippi's highway slopes built on expansive clay. Soil moisture content variation is monitored generally through borehole sensors in highway embankments and slopes. This point monitoring method lacks spatial resolution, and the sensors are susceptible to premature failure due to wear and tear. In contrast, Unmanned/Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have higher spatial and temporal resolutions that enable more efficient monitoring of site conditions, including soil moisture variation. The current study focused on developing two methods to predict soil moisture content (?) using UAV-captured optical and thermal combined with machine learning and statistical modeling. The first method used Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) color values from UAV-captured optical images to predict ?. Support Vector Machine for Regression (SVR), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), and Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) models were trained and evaluated for predicting ? from RGB values. The XGB model and MLR model outperformed the SVR model in predicting soil moisture content from RGB values. The R-2 values for the XGB and MLR models were >0.9 for predicting soil moisture when compared to SVR (R-2 = 0.25). The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for XGB, SVR, and MLR were 0.009, 0.025, and 0.01, respectively, for the test dataset, affirming that XGB was the best-performing model among the three models evaluated, followed by MLR and SVR. The better-performing XGB and MLR models were further validated by predicting soil moisture using unseen input data, and they provided good prediction results. The second method used Diurnal Land Surface Temperature variation (?LST) from UAV-captured Thermal Infrared (TIR) images to predict ?. TIR images of vegetation-covered areas and bare ground areas of the highway embankment side slopes were processed to extract ?LST amplitudes. The underlying relationship between soil surface thermal inertia and moisture content variation was utilized to develop a predictive model. The resulting single-parameter power curve fit model accurately predicted soil moisture from ?LST, especially in vegetation-covered areas. The power curve fit model was further validated on previously unseen TIR, and it predicted ? with an accuracy of RMSE = 0.0273, indicating good prediction performance. The study was conducted on a field scale and not in a controlled environment, which aids in the generalizability of the developed predictive models.

AB  - A three-year study was conducted to examine the spatial and temporal variability of phosphorus concentrations and mass loads within four sub-basins in the Crowfoot Creek watershed in southern Alberta, Canada. Monitoring was carried out at the inflows and outflows of the four sub-basins from mid-March until the end of October in 1997 to 1999. Data were collected on flow, total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP). The TP and TDP concentrations increased and were greatest during spring snowmelt and rainfall runoff events. Median TP concentrations varied from 0.022 to 1.141 mg L-1 and median TDP concentrations varied from 0.005 to 1.031 mg L-1. Within the sub-basins, phosphorus concentrations generally increased between inflow and outflows. The presence of grassland and well-developed crop cover adjacent to the watercourses generally resulted in a greater proportion of TDP in runoff. The proportion of TP as TDP varied from 31 to 97% and appeared to be affected by the timing of the storm and antecedent moisture conditions of the soil. The proportion of phosphorus exported during events made up from 1 to 83% of the total phosphorus load during the post-spring runoff period. Phosphorus concentrations exceeded Alberta surface water quality guidelines most of the time; however, the addition of irrigation return flow water generally improved water quality in Crowfoot Creek.

AB  - The availability of soil nutrients can have significant influence on water quality and wetland productivity. Nitrogen mineralization is the important process transferred from organic nitrogen to plant-available inorganic forms by soil animals and microorganism. Soil nitrogen mineralization processes in coastal wetlands will be greatly impacted by the significant changes of soil water and salt conditions caused by global climate change in the future. However, further studies concerning the effects of water and salt on soil nitrogen mineralization is still needed. The influences of other soil physicalchemical properties and plant community on soil nitrogen mineralization processes are also concluded. The influencing mechanism of soil nitrogen mineralization can be explained using the laboratory incubation, whereas the in situ incubation can contribute to reflecting the real nitrogen mineralization information in the field. The laboratory and in situ incubation methods combined with 15N tracing-isotope technique should be combined and applied to better reflect and explain soil nitrogen mineralization processes. Moreover, the applications of modern molecular biology techniques are also very necessary to quantitatively and accurately study nitrogen mineralization.

AB  - Curve number (CN) is a principal factor which is widely used in hydrology, specifically in the rainfall-runoff modelling. Its value varies based on soil moisture condition; soil hydrologic group, land use, and vegetation cover type. Remote sensing technology provides a tool to investigate spatiotemporal variations of land-cover. This may lead to generation of some continuous spatiotemporal CN datasets required for many hydrological applications. The purpose of this research is to develop an approach for estimating a monthly-distributed curve number via MODIS leaf area index (LAI) products. For calculating monthly CN, we investigated the relationship between monthly LAI, rainfall and CN under different computational scenarios of arithmetic mean, median, and geometric mean for estimating monthly LAI and rainfall. For this purpose, rainfall data for the period 2002-2016 were collected. Further, LAI data were obtained from MODIS for the same period. The performance of the modelled CN (correlation coefficients and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient) was compared against obtained values of monthly rainfall and runoff in the SCS-CN method (observation-based CN). The findings of this study suggested that CN values obtained from the arithmetic mean of LAI and the geometric mean of rainfall yielded the best scenario (R-2 = 0.916 and NS = 0.903 for calibration set; R-2 = 0.926 and NS = 0.892 for validation set). Therefore, we suggest a simple appropriate method to generate monthly spatially distributed CN for hydrological applications.

AB  - This study unveils regional patterns of rainfall-runoff event characteristics in Germany and identifies their spatial controls. Characteristics describing mean value, variability, and seasonality of event runoff coefficient, time scale, rise time, and of the occurrence of multiple-peak events are derived for a set of 196,073 rainfall-runoff events observed in 401 mesoscale German catchments. Multiobjective performances of various variable selection methods are used to identify hydrologically relevant variables from a comprehensive set of 115 descriptors of climate, topography, geomorphology, soil, land use, hydrogeology, and geology for every catchment. Results show that although event characteristics have relatively clear regional patterns due to the dominance of climatic controls at regional scale, subsurface properties (i.e., catchment storage) play a considerable role for the prediction of event runoff response. Compared to other tested variable selection methods, the application of a backward elimination procedure allows for the most accurate prediction of spatial patterns and regionalized values of event characteristics identifying soil depth, hydraulic permeability and frequency, size, and seasonality of wet spells as hydrologically relevant catchment descriptors. Climatic and hydrogeological descriptors outperform other generic groups of catchment descriptors. The hydrological interpretation of the emergent regional pattern of event characteristics, their variability, and seasonality provides insight on archetypical catchment behaviors and their controls.

AB  - When choosing sites for monitoring of soil moisture for hydrological purposes, a suitable process that considers the factors influencing soil moisture level should be followed. In this study, two multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods, the multi-influencing factor (MIF) method and the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method, were used to identify the optimal soil moisture monitoring (SMM) sites in the Dry Creek Catchment in South Australia. The most representative areas for nine SMM sites were obtained using the MIF method, considering the factors of rainfall, soil type, land use, catchment slope, elevation, and upslope accumulated area (UAA). The AHP method was used to select the optimal sites using the site-specific criteria. 30.3% of the catchment area in the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L) Grid_DC2 can be considered acceptable as representative area with the MIF method. Four potential sites were evaluated for each AWRA-L grid using the relative weights of the site-specific criteria with the AHP method. The Grid_DC2 required two sites that had the highest overall weight chosen with the AHP analysis. The procedure was repeated for the remaining four AWRA-L grids within the study area to select the required SMM sites.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) accumulation and the risk of P release were studied in the estuarine sediments of the Chaohu Lake Valley in Eastern China. Rapid agricultural intensification has occurred in this area since the 1980s, resulting in the extensive use of phosphate fertilizers. This extensive use of phosphate has affected P processes throughout the valley and resulted in the total phosphorus (TP) contents in the substrates and surface sediments increasing from 374 to 537 mg/kg, on average. Of all the forms of P evaluated in this study, residual P (Res-P) was present at the highest levels and accounted for 19.8-74.0% of the TP. Conversely, the lowest contents were observed for KCl-extracted P (KCl-P), which accounted for only 0.602% of the TP. Additionally, aluminum/iron-bound P (NaOH-Pi), which accounted for 16.0-53.1% of the TP, was an important factor that caused the TP to increase due to long-term P fertilization. However, calcium-bound P (Ca-P) was maintained at a relatively stable level. Furthermore, the degree of P saturation (DPS) and the P-induced lake eutrophication risk index (ERI) were investigated to determine the risk of release of P from the sediments. The average DPS and ERI values were found to range from 3.92-21.4% and from 12.6-33.6%, respectively. These results suggest that almost half of the estuarine sediments posed a potential risk of eutrophication. Moreover, these findings indicate that estuarine sediments that have been enriched with P are likely the sources of P that lead to the formation of algal blooms in Chaohu Lake.

AB  - West Africa faces a rapid growth in population and a subsequent demand for food production. Despite increasing demand, local farmers still follow traditional practices and try to overcome low productivity by continuously expanding cultivated areas. To assess the consequences of this expansion and to describe, based on anticipated population growth rates and land accessibility, the dynamics of agricultural land-use, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based ALADYN model of agricultural land use in the savannah around Kita, Mali. The model is based on remote sensing data on agricultural land use and data from field surveys. The ALADYN simulations clearly demonstrate that traditional agriculture is not sustainable. Even under the optimistic scenario of a declining rate of population growth, the current agricultural practices will result in the cultivation of all available agricultural lands by 2015. Under current practices, every farm will experience a period of 1-3 years every 15-20 years, during which field fertility will be too low to allow cultivation. Thus, to avoid severe food shortage, emigration or alternative sources of food are necessary. Comparison of the model and remote sensing data reveals that already in 2003 the cultivated part of the study area is lower than projected. That is, farmers anticipate over-exploitation and, most probably, emigrate from the area. The model highlights the great need for new agricultural practices in West Africa. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Surface water and energy balance plays an important role in land surface models, especially in coupled land surface-atmospheric models due to the complicated interactions between land surfaces and the overlying atmosphere. The primary purpose of this paper is to demonstrate the significant negative impacts that a minor deficiency in the parameterization of canopy evaporation may have on offline and coupled land surface model simulations. In this research, using the offline NCAR Land Surface Model (LSM) and the locally coupled NCAR Single-column Community Climate Model (SCCM) as examples, intensive effort has been focused on the exploration of the mechanisms involved in the activation of unrealistically high canopy evaporation and thus unreasonable surface energy partitions because of a minor deficiency in the parameterization of canopy evaporation. The main causes responsible for exacerbating the impacts of the deficiency of the land surface model through the coupling of the two components are analyzed, along with possible impacts of land surface parameters in triggering the problems. Results from experimental runs show that, for a large number of randomly generated physically realistic land surface parameter sets, this model deficiency has caused the occurrences of negative canopy water with a significantly high frequency for both the offline NCAR LSM and the coupled NCAR SCCM, suggesting that land surface parameters are not the only important factors in triggering the problems associated with the model deficiency. In addition, the concurrence of intense solar radiation and enough precipitation is identified to be mainly responsible for exacerbating the negative impacts of the parameterization deficiency. Finally, a simple adjustment has been made in this study to effectively prevent the occurrences of negative canopy water storages, leading to significantly improved model performances.

AB  - Data assimilation has allowed hydrologists to account for imperfections in observations and uncertainties in model estimates. Typically, updated members are determined as a compromised merger between observations and model predictions. The merging procedure is conducted in decision space before model parameters are updated to reflect the assimilation. However, given the dynamics between states and model parameters, there is limited guarantee that when updated parameters are applied into measurement models, the resulting estimate will be the same as the updated estimate. To account for these challenges, this study uses evolutionary data assimilation (EDA) to estimate streamflow in gauged and ungauged watersheds. EDA assimilates daily streamflow into a Sacramento soil moisture accounting model to determine updated members for eight watersheds in southern Ontario, Canada. The updated members are combined to estimate streamflow in ungauged watersheds where the results show high estimation accuracy for gauged and ungauged watersheds. An evaluation of the commonalities in model parameter values across and between gauged and ungauged watersheds underscore the critical contributions of consistent model parameter values. The findings show a high degree of commonality in model parameter values such that members of a given gauged/ungauged watershed can be estimated using members from another watershed.

AB  - Typically, when using data assimilation to improve hydrologic forecasting, observations are assimilated up to the start of the forecast. This is done to provide more accurate state and parameter estimates which, in turn, allows for a better forecast. We propose an extension to the traditional data assimilation approach which allows for assimilation to continue into the forecast to further improve the forecast's performance and reliability. This method was tested on two small, highly urbanized basins in southern Ontario, Canada; the Don River and Black Creek basins. Using a database of forcing data, model states, predicted streamflow, and streamflow observations, a lookup function was used to provide an observation during the forecast which can be assimilated. This allows for an indirect way to assimilate the numerical weather prediction forcing data. This approach can help in addressing prediction uncertainty, since an ensemble of previous observations can be pulled from the database which correspond to the forecast probability density function given previous information. The results show that extending data assimilation into the forecast can improve forecast performance in these urban basins, and it was shown that the forecast reliability could be improved by up to 78%.

In organic farming, however, soil nutrient stocks are regarded as an additional source of plant-available nutrients that can be mobilised by crop plants through rhizosphere effects. Therefore, unlike in conventional farming, the focus is not on replacement of the nutrients removed by the harvested products through readily soluble fertilisers enhancing nutrient concentrations in the soil solution. Instead, it is on minimising nutrient losses and supplying plant nutrients through soil-plant-microorganism interactions in which improved soil structure and enhanced soil biological activity facilitate plant-induced nutrient mobilisation and nutrient uptake under conditions of limited nutrient availability in the soil. This paper reviews these soil processes that improve the availability of macro- and micronutrients to plant roots under conditions of limited nutrient availability. It focuses on providing a conceptual framework for the different processes contributing to nutrient mobilisation and within which the various strategies for improving nutrient efficiency can be integrated in organically managed soils. Essential farm management options based on scientific views of nutrient dynamics to maintain soil fertility are addressed. With diverse, legume-based crop rotations with an adequate proportion of time dedicated to fertility building crops, careful management of manure and organic residues, and by using permitted inputs for phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), organic farms can be managed sustainably. However, efforts for recycling nutrients, mainly phosphorus, need to be enhanced.

AB  - Seasonal water content fluctuation within the effective root zone was monitored during the growing season for a maize-bean intercrop (IMB), sole maize (SM) and sole bean (SB) in Free State Province, Republic of South Africa. Comparisons were undertaken for progressive depths of extraction 0-300 mm; 300-600 mm and 600-900 mill respectively. These enabled the understanding of water extraction behavior of the cropping systems within the different soil layers including the topsoil surface normally influenced by soil surface evaporation.
   Additive intercrops have been known to conserve water, largely due to the early high leaf area index and the higher total leaf area. In this study, the combined effect of the intercrop components seemed to lower the total water demand by the intercrop compared to the sole crops. During the two seasons (2000/2001 and 2001/2002) the drained upper limit (DUL) and crop lower limits (CLL) were determined. The maize-bean intercrop, sole maize and sole bean had CLL of 141 mm/m, 149 mm/m and 159 mm/m respectively. The DUL was 262 mm/m for the site and therefore the potential plant extractable soil water for the cropping systems were: 121 mm/m (IMB); 114 mm/m (SM) and 103 mm/m (SB). Overall, the intercrop did not have significantly different total soil water extraction during both seasons, although it was additive, showing that it had higher water to biomass conversion.

AB  - The soil microbial community is a key indicator to evaluate the soil health and productivities in agricultural ecosystems. Monoculture and conversions of forests to tea plantations have been widely applied in tea plantation globally, but long-term monoculture of tea plantation could lead to soil degradation and yield decline. Understanding how long-term monoculture systems influence the soil health and ecosystem functions in tea plantation is of great importance for soil environment management. In this study, through the comparison of three independent tea plantations across eastern China composed of varying stand ages (from 3 to 90 years after conversion from forest), we found that long-term tea monoculture led to significant increases in soil total organic carbon (TOC) and microbial nitrogen (MBN). Additionally, the structure, function, and co-occurrence network of soil bacterial communities were investigated by pyrosequencing 16S rRNA genes. The pyrosequencing analysis revealed that the structures and functions of soil bacterial communities were significantly affected by different stand ages, but sampling sites and land-use conversion (from forest to tea plantation) had stronger effects than stand age on the diversity and structure of soil bacterial communities. Soil bacterial diversity can be improved with increasing stand ages in tea plantation. Further RDA analysis revealed that the C and N availability improvement in tea plantation soils led to the variation of structure and function in soil bacterial communities. Moreover, co-occurrence network analysis of soil bacterial communities also demonstrated that interactions among soil bacteria taxa were strengthened with increasing stand age. Our findings suggest that long-term monoculture with proper managements could be beneficial to soil ecosystems by increasing the C and N content and strengthening bacterial associations in tea plantations. Overall, this study provides a comprehensive understanding of the impact of land-use change and long-term monoculture stand age on soil environments in tea plantation.

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is dominated by small holder-farmers who have limited access to chemical fertilizers. This study was conducted in Eastern Uganda with a primary objective to investigate the intricate relationship between crop residue quality, soil carbon and nitrogen mineralization, and their collective impact on maize yields and residue quality. Employing a randomized completely block design (RCBD) over a two-year period (2013 - 2014), the study involved cattle manure, Tithonia compost each applied at 2t/ha, and maize residues which was applied at 4t/ha. Maize grain yield, maize stover and soil properties were measured at the harvesting period. Particularly, soil from each treatment plots and control was collected for laboratory chemical analysis to determine the Nitrogen(N), Phosphorus (P), potassium (K) content. At the end of each growing period, maize residues were also collected and analysed for the N, P, K content. Carbon (C) and N mineralization experiments were conducted in the laboratory that tested the potential of these organic amendments for soil nutrient release. In 2013 maize grain yield increased by 87, 27 and 13% following the application of cattle manure, Tithonia compost and maize residues compared to control plots, respectively. In 2014 maize grain yields improved significantly from 59% to 106% in plots with organic amendments. Over the two years, maize stover yield increased by 25% in the first year and a 56% in the second year compared to control plots. The impact of these organic materials also resulted in the doubling of N, P and K content in maize residues, particularly when cattle manure and Tithonia compost were applied. This, in turn, resulted in improved carbon mineralization and enhanced net nitrogen mineralization. This study demonstrated that application of organic soil amendments improves both maize yields and the quantity and quality of subsequent maize residues. For better results long-term application of these organic amendments and maize residues have the potential to reduce the need for additional inputs and could support a more sustainable and economically viable approach to maize production.

AB  - Changes in soil bulk density and soil nutrient profiles are a major concern of dryland grain producers considering grazing sheep on cereal stubble fields. Our objective was to compare burned, grazed, tilled, trampled and clipped wheat stubble fields on changes in soil bulk density and soil nutrient profiles. Treatments were evaluated in a series of three experiments using a randomized complete block design and four replications at each site. Contrast statements were used to make pre-planned comparisons among treatments. For Experiment 1, treatments were fall tilled, fall grazed, spring grazed, fall and spring combined (Fall/Spr) grazed, and an untreated control. Five mature ewes were confined with electric fence to a 111 m(2) plot for 24 h for fall and spring grazed plots resulting in a stocking rate of 452 sheeps d/ha. For Fall/Spr, the stocking rate was 904 sheeps d/ha. For Experiment 2, treatments were fall grazed, fall burned, fall tilled, and an untreated control. In Experiment 3, treatments were fall trampling by sheep, spring trampling by sheep, fall and spring combined (Fall/Spr) trampling by sheep, hand clipping to a stubble height of 4.5 em, and an untreated control. Trampling treatments were done at the same stocking rates as grazing treatments but sheep were muzzled to prevent intake. In Experiment 1, post-treatment organic matter tended to be greater (P=0.09) in the mean of the grazed treatments than control plots. In all of the experiments, change in soil bulk density, and soil nutrient profiles did not consistently differ (P > 0.07) among treatments in any manner that would suggest a detrimental impact of grazing sheep on small grain residue. These results indicate a strong potential for grazing sheep on grain stubble without adversely impacting soil bulk density or nutrient profiles. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Farmers in Ghana use a variety of soil-fertility management practices to optimize the benefits of shifting cultivation and/or to intensify their production. The research question was to analyze the relationship between these practices and the availability of the production factors land, labor, and capital. A farm survey along a gradient through SW Ghana showed that there is only a weak link between the intensification of traditional farming Systems, population pressure, and reduced fallow periods as long as shifting cultivation is possible and common. Even where fallow periods reach a cut-off point, farmers might look for land in remoter areas or invest in off farm activities. Only where market proximity supports the production of high-value crops, investment flows are used to maintain continuous cultivation on favorable production sites, especially those with water access. The results verify the validity of the framework of agricultural-systems dynamics in W Africa, developed by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the importance to distinguish between population-driven and market-driven situations. Both meet in periurban areas, which make them hot spots for research and development, while support for intensification is likely to fail where markets are far and shifting cultivation still an option.

AB  - Soil nutrient status under different slope positions in an alley cropping system as affected by two management practices (pattern of biomass incorporation and crop combination) was investigated. A split-plot in randomized complete block design was used with three replications. Three treatments of factor A, were randomly used in the main plots: BI1 (biomass applied in the upper one-third of the alleyways), BI2 (biomass in the upper two-thirds of the alleyways) and BI3 (biomass throughout the alleyways as control because most of the farmers follow this. system). Three treatments of factor B were used in the three subplots of each main plot: CC, (pure stand or sole corn as control), CC2 (corn + sweet potato) and CC3 (corn + peanut).
   Soil pH increased slightly by an average of 0.44 compared to its initial value of 6.04 as a result of the various systems of biomass incorporation and crop combination. Organic matter (OM) content after the wet season crop harvest was lower than the initial OM, although more than 2.5 t ha(-1) of green leaves of Flemingia macrophylia were incorporated in the soil. OM content sharply increased after the dry season crop harvest. In most cases, available P and exchangeable K decreased due to cropping. In general, cation exchange capacity (CEC) had a slight increase due to the effect of biomass incorporation and crop combination. Differences in all soil chemical properties except pH and cation exchange capacity were significant between the upslope and downslope portions of the alley.

AB  - Soil loss due to crop harvest contributes to land degradation, and knowledge of this challenge can guide the choice of crops for sustainable agriculture. Nigeria is the largest producer of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and the third largest producer of peanut (Arachis hypogaea Linn) in the world. Due to limited information on soil loss during peanut and cassava harvests worldwide, and cost of nutrient loss, a two-year field experiment was conducted to compare soil loss due to harvesting of peanut and cassava and to estimate cost of nutrient loss due to crop harvest under traditional agriculture. Peanut pod yields of 2.39 and 2.08 t ha(-1) harvest(-1) removed 0.62 and 0.58 t ha(-1) harvest(-1) during peanut harvest, respectively, for years 1 and 2. Similarly, cassava yields of 22.71 and 21.40 t ha(-1) harvest(-1) removed 1.11 and 0.91 t ha(-1 )harvest(-1) during cassava harvest, respectively, for years 1 and 2. Crop yields strongly correlated with soil loss due to peanut harvest (R-2 = 0.36; p < 0.001) and soil loss due to cassava harvest (R-2 = 0.23;p < 0.01). Significantly higher soil loss due to cassava harvest compared to peanut harvest can be ascribed to higher cassava yield. Also, soil nutrient loss due to crop harvest was significantly (p < 0.001) higher for cassava compared with peanut by 27.6% phosphorus (P) and 73.7% potassium (K) for the first year and 39.2% P and 79.1% K for the second year. Fertilizer equivalent cost of P and K losses due to cassava harvest for the two years was higher than that of peanut by US$29 ha(-1).The study indicated that the intensity of nutrient loss by harvesting is largely dependent on the crop type, and harvesting of cassava can deplete soil nutrients faster than that of peanut under traditional agriculture. Sequential planting of cassava (deep rooted crop) followed by peanut (shallow rooted crop) as a crop rotation management practice is recommended to mitigate soil loss due to continuous harvesting of cassava, and harvesting with thorough shaking technique is also suggested to reduce nutrient loss potential of crop harvesting.

AB  - Non-destructive soil water content determination is a fundamental component for many agricultural and environmental applications. The accuracy and costs of the sensors define the measurement scheme and the ability to fit the natural heterogeneous conditions. The aim of this study was to evaluate five commercially available and relatively cheap sensors usually grouped with impedance and FDR sensors. ThetaProbe ML2x (impedance) and ECH2O EC-10, ECH2O EC-20, ECH2O EC-5, and ECH2O TE (all FDR) were tested on silica sand and loess of defined characteristics under controlled laboratory conditions. The calibrations were carried out in nine consecutive soil water contents from dry to saturated conditions (pure water and saline water). The gravimetric method was used as a reference method for the statistical evaluation (ANOVA with significance level 0.05). Generally, the results showed that our own calibrations led to more accurate soil moisture estimates. Variance component analysis arranged the factors contributing to the total variation as follows: calibration (contributed 42%), sensor type (contributed 29%), material (contributed 18%), and dry bulk density (contributed 11%). All the tested sensors performed very well within the whole range of water content, especially the sensors ECH2O EC-5 and ECH2O TE, which also performed surprisingly well in saline conditions.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to investigate the potential of sentinel-1 SAR sensor products and the contribution of soil roughness parameters to estimate volumetric residual soil moisture (RSM) in the Upper Blue Nile (UBN) basin, Ethiopia. The backscatter contribution of crop residue water content was estimated using Landsat sensor product and the water cloud model (WCM). The surface roughness parameters were estimated from the Oh and Baghdadi models. A feed-forward artificial neural network (ANN) method was tested for its potential to translate SAR backscattering and surface roughness input variables to RSM values. The model was trained for three inversion configurations: (i) SAR backscattering from vertical transmit and vertical receive (SAR VV) polarization only; (ii) using SAR VV and the standard deviation of surface heights (h(rms)), and (iii) SAR VV, h(rms), and optimal surface correlation length (l(eff)). Field-measured volumetric RSM data were used to train and validate the method. The results showed that the ANN soil moisture estimation model performed reasonably well for the estimation of RSM using the single input variable of SAR VV data only. The ANN prediction accuracy was slightly improved when SAR VV and the surface roughness parameters (h(rms) and l(eff)) were incorporated into the prediction model. Consequently, the ANN's prediction accuracy with root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.035 cm(3)/cm(3), mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.026 cm(3)/cm(3), and r = 0.73 was achieved using the third inversion configuration. The result implies the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data to accurately retrieve RSM content over an agricultural site covered by stubbles. The soil roughness parameters are also potentially an important variable to soil moisture estimation using SAR data although their contribution to the accuracy of RSM prediction is slight in this study. In addition, the result highlights the importance of combining Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat images based on an ANN approach for improving RSM content estimations over crop residue areas.

AB  - Precision agriculture (PA) strongly relies on spatially differentiated sensor information. Handheld instruments based on laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) are a promising sensor technique for the in-field determination of various soil parameters. In this work, the potential of handheld LIBS for the determination of the total mass fractions of the major nutrients Ca, K, Mg, N, P and the trace nutrients Mn, Fe was evaluated. Additionally, other soil parameters, such as humus content, soil pH value and plant available P content, were determined. Since the quantification of nutrients by LIBS depends strongly on the soil matrix, various multivariate regression methods were used for calibration and prediction. These include partial least squares regression (PLSR), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (Lasso), and Gaussian process regression (GPR). The best prediction results were obtained for Ca, K, Mg and Fe. The coefficients of determination obtained for other nutrients were smaller. This is due to much lower concentrations in the case of Mn, while the low number of lines and very weak intensities are the reason for the deviation of N and P. Soil parameters that are not directly related to one element, such as pH, could also be predicted. Lasso and GPR yielded slightly better results than PLSR. Additionally, several methods of data pretreatment were investigated.

AB  - Pulse and continuous irrigation can affect water distribution in the soil, thereby affecting the growth and distribution of root systems. Different base and topdressing fertilizers can affect nitrogen transport in the soil and root distribution, thus affecting root water and nitrogen uptake. This study used pot experiments to set up four different nitrogen levels, including two different irrigation methods, to research the effects of soil moisture, nitrogen transport, nitrogen accumulation and root systems under the conditions of continuous and pulse irrigation, as well as different nitrogen applications. Result showed that continuous irrigation can increase the moisture content around the drip emitter position and reduce the soil moisture content in the horizontal spreading compared with pulse irrigation, especially reducing the horizontal spreading in the deep soil layers. One treatment in this study did not apply base fertilizer, and then supply topdressing fertilizer at a ratio of 2:4:4 in the seedling stage, jointing stage and tasseling stage, respectively. This treatment is beneficial for improving nitrogen utilization efficiency. Furthermore, this treatment can increase the root length density and root surface area in the deep soil layers, especially in the 20-35 cm soil depth, and to some extent increase the deep growth of the root system.

AB  - Soil wetness is an important property in determining the variable disposition of hillslopes to shallow landslides. Recent studies have demonstrated the potential of in situ soil wetness information for landslide early warning. However, the spatial representativeness of in situ sensors may be affected by local heterogeneities of soil properties and hydrological processes, and their installation may be destructive. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) has been used in the past to estimate plot-scale soil moisture variation and may overcome these limitations. In this study, we installed and operated an automated ERT monitoring system on a landslide-prone hillslope in the Napf region (Switzerland). The system was operational during a period of 9 mo, and measurements were conducted at high temporal resolution and under different soil hydrological conditions. Electrical resistivity was measured along two perpendicular profile lines in Wenner-Schlumberger configuration at 0.25-m electrode spacing. Soil saturation was calculated by the Archie's law and the parameters were fitted with colocated soil moisture sensors. Comparison of ERT-derived soil moisture with soil wetness from in situ sensors showed a good correlation, and infiltration properties critical for landslide early warning could be reliably reproduced. Further, analysis of spatial saturation variation revealed that ERT was capable to detect heterogeneities of soil hydrological process. Under highly saturated conditions, the reliability of the saturation estimation was affected by an increased number of faulty measurements and the spatial heterogeneity of the infiltration process.

AB  - Reliable soil moisture information is vital for optimal irrigation management, farm-level agronomic decision-making, hydrologic studies, and cropping systems modeling. A wide range of soil moisture sensing technologies is commercially available, but their performance must be evaluated for diverse conditions of use. In this research, we investigated nine soil moisture sensors based on time-domain reflectometry, capacitance, and electrical resistance principles in production field conditions with two installation orientations, i.e., vertical (V) and horizontal (H), in two soils (silt loam and loamy sand) and two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Performance parameters deduced from the 2017 datasets revealed that sensor type and soil type significantly affected the soil moisture sensor performance under factory calibration (F.C.); however, sensor installation orientation did not. Thus, the sensors were only evaluated based on their performance in horizontal orientation in both soils. Precision and accuracy were considered targets to assist in appropriate sensor selection. To improve sensor accuracy, site-specific calibration (S.S.C.) functions were developed and validated using independent datasets from 2018. Considering mean bias error (MBE), all sensors overestimated volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) in both soils, with the exception of TEROS 21 (MPS-6) in silt loam and JD probe in loamy sand. On average, sensor performance was 67% better in loamy sand than in silt loam. Overall, the sensors showed higher precision in silt loam (R-2 = 0.53 to 0.93) than in loamy sand (R-2 = 0.25 to 0.82). Substantial post-S.S.C. improvement (32% to 89%) was observed in all sensors' performance relative to F.C. in silt loam. In loamy sand, while most sensors performed reasonably well with F.C., considerable improvements (28% to 85%) were observed with S.S.C. Significant differences (p < 0.05) were observed in sensors' sensitivity to soil temperature (T-soil), which ranged from 14 degrees C to 23 degrees C in silt loam and from 14 degrees C to 25 degrees C loamy sand during the experiments. The CS655, 10HS, 5TE, and TEROS 21 (MPS-6) sensors showed significant (p < 0.05) sensitivity to T-soil fluctuations, with T-soil explaining a maximum of 17% of the variance observed in sensor performance. No statistically significant (p > 0.05) sensitivity was detected for any of the sensors in loamy sand. TEROS 21 (MPS-6) had the highest sensitivity to T-soil with a slope of -4.25. In contrast, while statistically significant (p < 0.05), 5TE was the least sensitive to T-soil variability with a slope of 1.81. The information, data, and analyses presented here can be instrumental for informed sensor selection and use in decision-making in production fields with similar soil textures and soil water regimes.

AB  - Measurement of carbon dynamics of soybean (Glycine max L.) ecosystems outside Corn Belt of the United States (U.S.) is lacking. This study examines the seasonal variability of net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and its components (gross primary production, GPP and ecosystem respiration, ER), and relevant controlling environmental factors between rainfed (El Reno, Oklahoma) and irrigated (Stoneville, Mississippi) soybean fields in the southern U.S. during the 2016 growing season. Grain yield was about 1.6 t ha(-1) for rainfed soybean and 4.9 t ha(-1) for irrigated soybean. The magnitudes of diurnal NEE (similar to 2-weeks average) reached seasonal peak values of -23.18 and -34.78 mu mol m(-2) S-1 in rainfed and irrigated soybean, respectively, approximately two months after planting (i.e., during peak growth). Similar thresholds of air temperature (T-a, slightly over 30 degrees C) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, similar to 2.5 kPa) for NEE were observed at both sites. Daily (7-day average) NEE, GPP, and ER reached seasonal peak values of 4.55, 13.54, and 9.95 g C m(-2) d(-1) in rainfed soybean and -7.48, 18.13, and 14.93 g C m(-2) d(-1) in irrigated soybean, respectively. The growing season (DOY 132-243) NEE, GPP, and ER totals were 54, 783, and 729 g C m(-2), respectively, in rainfed soybean. Similarly, cumulative NEE, GPP, and ER totals for DOY 163-256 (flux measurement was initiated on DOY 163, missing first 45 days after planting) were 291, 1239, and 948 g C m(-2), respectively, in irrigated soybean. Rainfed soybean was a net carbon sink for only two months, while irrigated soybean appeared to be a net carbon sink for about three months. However, grain yield and the magnitudes and seasonal sums of CO2 fluxes for irrigated soybean in this study were comparable to those for soybean in the U.S. Corn Belt, but they were lower for rainfed soybean.

AB  - Besides floodplains, hillslopes are basic units that mainly control water movement and flow pathways within catchments of subdued mountain ranges. The structure of their shallow subsurface affects water balance, e. g. infiltration, retention, and runoff. Nevertheless, there is still a gap in the knowledge of the hydrological dynamics on hillslopes, notably due to the lack of generalization and transferability. This study presents a robust multi-method framework of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) in addition to hydrometric point measurements, transferring hydrometric data into higher spatial scales to obtain additional patterns of distribution and dynamics of soil moisture on a hillslope. A geoelectrical monitoring in a small catchment in the eastern Ore Mountains was carried out at weekly intervals from May to December 2008 to image seasonal moisture dynamics on the hillslope scale. To link water content and electrical resistivity, the parameters of Archie's law were determined using different core samples. To optimize inversion parameters and methods, the derived spatial and temporal water content distribution was compared to tensiometer data. The results from ERT measurements show a strong correlation with the hydrometric data. The response is congruent to the soil tension data. Water content calculated from the ERT profile shows similar variations as that of water content from soil moisture sensors. Consequently, soil moisture dynamics on the hillslope scale may be determined not only by expensive invasive punctual hydrometric measurements, but also by minimally invasive time-lapse ERT, provided that pedo-/petrophysical relationships are known. Since ERT integrates larger spatial scales, a combination with hydrometric point measurements improves the understanding of the ongoing hydrological processes and better suits identification of heterogeneities.

AB  - Wise phosphorus (P) management is paramount to ensure food and environmental security and prolong the life of P resources. Long-term experiments under winter wheat-summer maize (with irrigation) and winter wheat-summer fallow (rain-fed) cropping systems were undertaken to investigate P efficiency, soil P availability and P downward movement in the deep profile of a loess soil in China. The four nutrient management regimes in each experiment were: a control without any nutrient input; P and K combined (PK); N, P and K combined (NPK), and organic manure (M) combined with NPK (MNPK). The P efficiency ranged from 20 to 54% under the double cropping system, and from 13 to 33% in the single cropping system over the 25 years studied, and the highest P efficiency was in the NPK treatment in both systems. Application of P significantly increased soil total-P, Olsen-P and CaCl2-P over the years, especially in the MNPK treatment. Two segment regression analyses indicated that Olsen-P was about 14 mg kg(-1) or 16 mg kg(-1) for optimal crop yield under double cropping or single cropping. In addition, Olsen-P content above 37 mg kg(-1) or 57 mg kg(-1) led to a significant increase in CaCl2-P content under double cropping or single cropping, which might indicate risk of P leaching. After 24 years of P applications, total P accumulated at various depths depending on treatment under double cropping, but there was no accumulation under single cropping. While Olsen-P leached down to a depth of 300 cm in the MNPK treatments under both cropping systems, and higher concentrations were recorded in the deeper layers in single cropping than in double cropping systems. The Olsen-P leached to a shallower depth in the PK and NPK treatments under single cropping compared to double cropping. We conclude that P supply in excess of the crop's requirement (e.g. MNPK) or an unbalanced nutrient supply (e.g. PK) resulted in not only low P efficiency and massive accumulation of P in the topsoil but also leaching out of root zone under both irrigated and rain-fed conditions in the loess soil. Thus, P fertilization recommendations need to be adjusted based on changes in soil P over time.

AB  - Crop rotation and nitrogen (N) fertilization can influence soil N cycling, however, less is known about their interactive effects under varying soil and climatic conditions. We examined the interactive effects of preceding crops and N fertilizer rates on soil N cycling in canola (Brassica napus L.) and spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping systems in no-till soils in the Canadian prairies. Field pea (Pisum sativum L), lentil (Lens culinaris Medik), faba bean ( Vida faba L.; faba bean-seed), canola and wheat grown for grain, and faba bean green manure (faba bean-GRM) were the preceding crops and were direct-seeded at 7 and 6 locations in 2009 and 2010, respectively. Canola and wheat were seeded in 2010 and 2011 (2012 for wheat at one site), respectively with N fertilizer applied at 0, 30, 60, 90 and 120 kg N ha(-1). Above-ground residue N returned was greatest for faba bean-GRM and lowest for canola and wheat. On average across sites, apparent in-crop N mineralization (ANM) under canola was greater following faba bean-GRM than all other preceding crops, except field pea, while under wheat, ANM was greater following all the legumes than following canola and wheat. Crop N uptake increased with N fertilizer rate, but the response was generally lower following faba bean-GRM and lentil. The N budget showed that 40-65% of crop N uptake (35-100% at highest ANM site) was possibly derived from ANM, more so following legumes, as compared to 35-60% from N fertilizer. The surplus and unaccounted N were particularly pronounced when canola and wheat were preceded by legumes rather than by canola or wheat. Our findings indicate that legumes can enhance soil N supply in no-till soils, and also highlight the importance of adjusting N fertilizer rates based on preceding crops to minimize the potential for N losses.

AB  - Phosphorus distribution and stability in soils of the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) of south Florida is important because of changing land uses. We investigated the effects of land use on P distribution in the soil profile and between chemical fractions for a histosol of the Florida Everglades. Labile, Fe-Al bound, Ca-bound, humic-fulvic acid, and residual P pools in 0-15, 15-30, and 30-45 cm depths were determined for drained soils planted to sugarcane (Saccharum sp.) for 50 yr, pasture for 100 yr, turfgrass for 60 yr, and forest for 20 yr. The P concentrations of all chemical fractions decreased with depth in the profile, indicating accumulation in surface soil resulting from oxidation and fertilization. Trends in P distribution between chemical fractions were similar between land uses. Labile P comprised less than 1% of total P. Fe-Al bound P averaged 2.9% of the total P for turfgrass and forest, but 11.4 and 9.6% for sugarcane and pasture. Increasing soil disturbance and long-term fertilization increased P allocation to inorganic fractions, as Ca-bound P contained 49% of total P for sugarcane but 28% for other land uses. Total P stocks in the soil profile (0-45 cm) averaged 1,323, 2,005, 2,294, and 2,317 kg P ha(-1) for pasture, sugarcane, turfgrass, and forest, respectively. Under current land uses P in organic fractions represents an unstable pool since the soil is prone to oxidation under drained conditions. In contrast, P sequestered in inorganic fractions is more stable under current land uses, thus sugarcane cultivation and incorporation of bedrock CaCO3 into surface soil by tillage will enhance long-term P sequestration.

AB  - Cosmic radiation on Earth responds to heliospheric, geomagnetic, atmospheric, and lithospheric changes. In order to use its signal for soil hydrological monitoring, the signal of thermal and epithermal neutron detectors needs to be corrected for external influencing factors. However, theories about the neutron response to soil water, air pressure, air humidity, and incoming cosmic radiation are still under debate. To challenge these theories, we isolated the neutron response from almost any terrestrial changes by operating a bare and a moderated neutron detector in a buoy on a lake in Germany from July 15 to 02 December 2014. We found that the count rate over water has been better predicted by a theory from K & ouml;hli et al. (2021, ) compared to the traditional approach from Desilets et al. (2010, ). We further found strong linear correlation parameters to air pressure (beta = 0.0077 mb-1) and air humidity (alpha = 0.0054 m3/g) for epithermal neutrons, while thermal neutrons responded with alpha = 0.0023 m3/g. Both approaches, from Rosolem et al. (2013, ) and from K & ouml;hli et al. (2021, ), were similarly able to remove correlations of epithermal neutrons to air humidity. Correction for incoming radiation proved to be necessary for both thermal and epithermal neutrons, for which we tested different neutron monitor stations and correction methods. Here, the approach from Zreda et al. (2012, ) worked best with the Jungfraujoch monitor in Switzerland, while the approach from McJannet and Desilets (2023, ) was able to adequately rescale data from more remote neutron monitors. However, no approach was able to sufficiently remove the signal from a major Forbush decrease event on 13 September, to which thermal and epithermal neutrons showed a comparatively strong response. The buoy detector experiment provided a unique data set for empirical testing of traditional and new theories on Cosmic-Ray Neutron Sensing. It could serve as a local alternative to reference data from remote neutron monitors.
   Cosmic radiation near the Earth's surface is influenced by solar activity, atmospheric conditions, and changes of nearby soil moisture or snow. To better understand how cosmic-ray neutron measurements should be corrected for meteorological effects, we operated a detector for low-energy neutrons in a buoy on a lake in Germany for 5 months in 2014. Since the water content in the surroundings is constant, we were able to isolate the signal from almost any ground-related disturbances. With this instrument, we challenged traditional and recent theories on the neutron response to water, air humidity, and to reference data from high-energy neutron monitors around the world. We found that in some cases, recent theories showed superior performance over traditional approaches. We also found a stronger response of the neutrons detected by the buoy to a major solar event than was observed by traditional neutron monitors. The concept of a neutron detector on a lake could be useful as a reference station for similar land-side detectors and help provide more reliable soil moisture products.
   Neutron detectors on a buoy were deployed in the center of a lake for 5 months Thermal and epithermal signals correlated with air pressure, air humidity, and secondary cosmic rays from neutron monitors Data was used to challenge traditional correction approaches and to serve as an alternative neutron monitor

AB  - Leaf area index (LAI) is one of the most important indicators of agricultural variables because of its relation to biophysical and biochemical properties of agricultural crops. Variations in LAI can be related to changes in leaf scattering properties, and these variations in leaf scattering properties can lead to changes in canopy backscattering behaviour. The objective of this study was to explore the potential of estimating LAI using multi-temporal dual polarimetric TerraSAR-X data in three different agricultural field crops, including winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), and canola (Brassica napus L.). The relationship between LAI and the scattering coefficient (sigma degrees) in TerraSAR-X was explored using three different approaches, including univariate regression, i.e., simple linear and nonlinear regression, multivariate regression, i.e., stepwise regression, and a semi-empirical water cloud model (WCM). The multivariate stepwise regression showed its capability to retrieve the LAI without any external input data, such as soil moisture, based solely on the polarization channels, i.e., HH or VV, and polarization variables, e.g. HH/VV or HH+VV. However, unlike the WCM, the stepwise method is not applicable with just one polarization channel. The results indicate that the leaf area index (LAI) was Significantly and consistently correlated with sigma degrees throughout the growth stages using the stepwise regression and WCM approaches, whereas simple linear and nonlinear regression yielded relatively poor results except with barley.

AB  - Soil moisture (SM) plays important roles in surface energy conversion, crop growth, environmental protection, and drought monitoring. As crops grow, the associated vegetation seriously affects the ability of satellites to retrieve SM data. Here, we collected such data at different growth stages of maize using Bragg and X-Bragg scattering models based on the Freeman-Durden polarization decomposition method. We used the H/A/Alpha polarization decomposition approach to extract accurate threshold values of decomposed scattering components. The results showed that the H and Alpha values of bare soil areas were lower and those of vegetated areas were higher. The threshold values of the three scattering components were 0.2-0.4 H and 7-24 degrees Alpha for the surface scattering component, 0.6-0.9 H and 22-50 degrees Alpha for the volume scattering component, and other values for the dihedral scattering component. The SM data retrieved (using the X-Bragg model) on June 27, 2014, were better than those retrieved at other maize growth stages and were thus associated with the minimum root-mean-square error value (0.028). The satellite-evaluated SM contents were in broad agreement with data measured in situ. Our algorithm thus improves the accuracy of SM data retrieval from synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images.

AB  - A profile probe (PP) is a handy instrument for simultaneously measuring volumetric water content () at shallow multiple depths in the field. The accuracy of the measurement is important for moisture migration and water balance studies associated with the multilayered cover system (MLCS) provided over nonoperational landfills. There are no guidelines or controlled procedure for evaluating the accuracy of a PP for varying layers of an MLCS. A simple laboratory setup is developed in this study to evaluate all six sensors of a PP simultaneously for a particular soil type and compaction state. The results obtained from this study were used to improve the accuracy of PP measurements for the type of soils generally used in MLCSs. The validity of the proposed procedure was further evaluated based on a new set of PP measurements. The procedure adopted in this study improved the accuracy of PP measurement from +/- 6% to +/- 1%. The most interesting observation is the parity in sensor readings by following the proposed procedure, which was initially found to be different. The results from this study indicated that improper measurements can result in an error as high as 18% in the determination of change in soil water storage for different layers of a trial MLCS. Adopting the procedure proposed in this study ensures reliable and precise measurements for the materials used in MLCS for all the sensors of PP. In the absence of soil-specific calibration for PP, the equations proposed in this study can be used for the type of soils used in MLCSs.

AB  - Extensive areas of peatlands are drained around the world to create a favorable environment for food production, altering the natural anaerobic environment and nutrient dynamics in the soil. In this study, we used tropical peatlands subjected to monocultive (MC) of Manihot esculenta for 80 years and intercropped (IC) of Manihot esculenta and Cocos nucifera for 20 years and an area of natural vegetation (Forest), to estimate the effects of MC and IC systems maintained under drainage on the dynamics and accumulation of organic and inorganic fractions of P and on the potential of P adsorption by the soil. Our results showed that drainage predominantly altered inorganic fractions of P, having little influence on its organic fractions. In the short-term, the IC system reduced the total soil P content in subsurface by 35.6 and 37.9 % when compared with MC system and Forest, respectively, as a result of the reduction of all inorganic fractions of P. In all areas, regardless of the position in the profile, we observed the predominance of the highly recalcitrant residual P fraction (> 70 %) in the total P content of the soil. The adsorption process controlled P availability in peatlands subjected to drainage, reducing P availability only in the IC system. Based on our results, we indicate the MC of Manihot esculenta as the best cultivation system and we do not recommend of the IC system in tropical peatlands, as it presents serious risks of total depletion of the P content in soil. Our results provide new evidence on P dynamics in tropical peatlands subjected to drainage for long periods.

AB  - Sensor-based irrigation can be used to optimize crop production and deliver water precisely on demand. However, commercially available control systems can be expensive. To reduce the cost of automated irrigation systems, researchers have used alternative low-cost open-source platforms coupled to capacitive sensors that can monitor volumetric soil water content (VWC) in real-time, allowing on-demand water supply to plants. This study aims to design and develop a low-cost open-source irrigation system using a prototyping platform connected to soil moisture sensors to monitor and control irrigation automatically. And additionally, determine the water use efficiency of two cherry tomato (Solanum lycopersicum var. cerasiforme) cultivars grown using the system. The platform was designed, assembled, and tested to verify the ability to trigger irrigation on-demand at four different VWC thresholds at 0.23, 0.30, 0.37, and 0.44 m(3) m(-3). The setup used a microcontroller (Arduino Mega 2560 Rev3; Arduino, Ivrea, Italy) connected to soil moisture sensors (10HS; METER Group, Pullman, WA) and relay drivers (Adafruit; New York, NY, USA) to trigger irrigation automatically. This manuscript explains how to assemble the system using commercial equipment readily available in the market. Results indicate that the low-cost open-source platform and soil moisture sensors successfully monitored soil VWC and reliable controlled irrigation in cherry tomatoes. The technology significantly improved water use efficiency with the increase in VWC to trigger the system automatically.

AB  - Experimental field data are used at different levels of complexity to calibrate, validate and improve agroecosystem models to enhance their reliability for regional impact assessment. A methodological framework and software are presented to evaluate and classify data sets into four classes regarding their suitability for different modelling purposes. Weighting of inputs and variables for testing was set from the aspect of crop modelling. The software allows users to adjust weights according to their specific requirements. Background information is given for the variables with respect to their relevance for modelling and possible uncertainties. Examples are given for data sets of the different classes. The framework helps to assemble high quality data bases, to select data from data bases according to modellers requirements and gives guidelines to experimentalists for experimental design and decide on the most effective measurements to improve the usefulness of their data for modelling, statistical analysis and data assimilation.

AB  - In this study, the interacting effects of shade and planting methods on the growth and competitive ability of two understory plants Heracleum moellendorffii Hance and Adenophora divaricata Franch. & Sav. were investigated under different soil moisture and nutrient conditions. One-year-old seedlings were subjected to different light levels (0%, 35%, and 55% shade) and planting methods (monoculture and mixed) under contrasting soil moisture (1.2 L/m(2) and 2.3 L/m(2) of water) and soil nutrient conditions (unfertilized and fertilized). Here, shading significantly improved the height growth of H. moellendorffii (10-20 cm increase) in unfertilized and fertilized plots and at high soil moisture conditions. Contrarily, A. divaricata seedlings planted singly at full sunlight yielded a higher aboveground biomass growth (8-17 g plant(-1)), compared with those shaded and intercropped seedlings (0.9-3.9 g plant(-1)). The increased competitiveness of H. moellendorffii suppressed the growth of A. divaricata across different light conditions when planted together. The amount of light, soil moisture, and nutrients and their interactions significantly affected the growth of the seedlings, resulting in asymmetric interspecific competition between the two species. Results provide us with a better understanding of the environmental factors affecting plant growth for forest farming in the understory.

AB  - Winter rainfall in a Mediterranean region varies from year to year. Both release of inorganic N from soil organic matter (SOM) or a legume cover crop (LCC) and subsequent nitrate movement in the soil profile are strongly affected by winter rainfall, through its effects on soil water status and on vertical flux. N accumulation of a LCC also varies over years due to weather effects on growth. Thus, these two factors need to be taken into account for efficient use of SOM-N and LCC-N in a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation. To determine how winter weather might affect the performance of wheat-fallow rotations that include an LCC grown and incorporated during the fallow year, we used the CERES-wheat model and a 46-season weather record to simulate N dynamics of 2-year unfertilized and irrigated winter-LCC wheat systems with high LCC (236 kg N ha(-1)) or low LCC (118 kg N ha(-1)) inputs. Unfertilized and fertilized fallow-wheat controls were also simulated. Within a given LCC input value, coefficients of variation for total seasonal N supply (the sum of predicted wheat N uptake, N leaching and inorganic soil N at wheat maturity) over years were < 15%, despite the fluctuating winter rainfall (CV 48%). Average N leaching was predicted to be, highest in the high LCC input system (108 kg N ha(-1)), followed by the low LCC input system (86 kg N ha(-1)) and midseason-intensive and planting-intensive fertilized wheat-fallow systems (82 and 72 kg N ha(-1), respectively), and least in the unfertillized wheat-fallow system (54 kg N ha(-1)). N leaching exceeded 100 kg N ha(-1) in 4, 20, 16, 18, and 29 seasons out of 46 seasons, respectively, in the unfertilized and planting-intensive and midseason-intensive fertilized wheat-fallow rotations and in wheat rotations with low and high LCC inputs. There was no difference in predicted wheat yield among the four systems with N inputs from fertilizer or LCC, but yield was lower in the unfertilized wheat-fallow rotation. If the goal of use of LCC was to attain the same yield level as high LCC input or fertilized wheat system while diminishing the risk of N leaching, the low LCC input case met this goal in the short term. However, a simple balance sheet using the model showed that the N balance of the low LCC input system was -147 kg N ha(-1) season(-1), if we assumed 50% of LCC-N was derived from atmospheric fixation. The low-LCC-input system could therefore fail to maintain inherent soil N fertility in the long term unless nearly 100% LCC-N was derived from fixation. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this article, surface soil moisture was retrieved from Radarsat-2 and polarimetric target decomposition data by using semiempirical models and machine learning methods. The semiempirical models and machine learning techniques employed were Oh (1992), Dubois (1995), Oh (2004) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Least Squares - Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM), Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Kernel based Extreme Learning Machine (KELM), Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), respectively. In addition, Yamaguchi, van Zyl, Freeman-Durden, H/A/alpha and Cloude polarimetric target decomposition methods were used in this study. For soil moisture inversion, firstly, preprocessing was applied to the Radarsat-2 image of two different dates with bare and moderately vegetated soil. Then, sigma nought coefficients and the polarimetric decomposition components were extracted as feature vector from preprocessed SAR image pixels corresponding to ground measured points. Lastly, sigma nought coefficients were used in semiempirical inversion models, and sigma nought coefficients and polarimetric decomposition components were used as input to machine learning methods. The best accuracy results for semiempirical models were 13.01 vol. % and 17.91 vol. % Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) for bare and moderately vegetated soil, respectively. The best accuracy for machine learning techniques were 4.04 vol. % and 2.72 vol. % RMSE for two dates, respectively. The results indicated that the machine learning techniques performed much better than the semiempirical models.

AB  - It is well known that agricultural production contributes to global warming through the release of greenhouse gases CO2, N2O, and CH4, the most potent of which is N2O. However, most N2O emission studies focus on intensively managed, annual cropping systems. Few have documented greenhouse gas production in perennial crops, which often have substantially different agricultural management practices and growth patterns compared to annual crops. Hence, the objectives of this study were to (1) quantify seasonal and annual direct N2O emissions from a Mediterranean vineyard and (2) determine how conventional management practices such as irrigation, fertigation, cover cropping and tillage affect the magnitude and duration of N2O emissions. This study took place in a wine grape vineyard (Vitis vinifera)in Arbuckle, CA over a two-year period using closed-flux chamber measurements. Annual emissions totaled 3.92 kg N2O-N ha(-1) the first year, when a leguminous cover crop was planted in the alleys, while emissions in the second year when the alleys were fallow showed a 7-fold reduction, reaching only 0.56 kg N2O-N ha(-1). During the growing season of both years, fertigation events in the crop rows produced slightly increased emissions, ranging from 11 to 23 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1) and lasting less than one week, compared to the low background values of 0.5 g N2O-N ha(-1) day(-1). The largest fluxes occurred during the dormant season in response to the first precipitation event of the year, especially in the alleys. Nitrous oxide emissions following precipitation events in the second year, when the alleys were fallow, did not follow the same pattern, indicating the significant influence of cover crop-derived N (and C), when coupled with precipitation events, on annual N2O emissions. The results of this study indicate that the effects of individual management practices such as cover cropping may not be seen immediately, but instead act in sequence with other events when conditions are favorable for N2O production. Hence, when determining specific management practices to employ, it is important to recognize the interaction between management, climatic events, and time as important drivers in total N2O production.

AB  - The Mehlich 1 (M1) soil-test method has been used for soil phosphorus (P) extraction in southern Brazil. The objective of this work was to compare M1, Mehlich 3 (M3), and ionic exchange resin (resin) soil-test methods to evaluate the soil P available for crops and grasses in soils amended with phosphate rock (PR). Oxisol and Alfisol received triple superphosphate (TS) and PR. The M1 solution extracted greater P amounts in soils amended with PR compared with the M3 solution and resin methods. Lesser P amounts were extracted with the M3 solution. Crops yields were better associated with the P amounts extracted with M3 and resin methods in soils amended with PR. The results showed that M1 overestimates soil P availability to plants in soils amended with PR; the M3 solution best estimated the soil P available for crops and grasses in soils amended with PR.

AB  - The aim of this study was to test different soil phosphorus (P) extraction methods in relation to plant P uptake. A greenhouse pot experiment was conducted with spring wheat. The soils were extracted with the following methods/extractants: H2O, CaCl2, LiCl, iron oxide impregnated filter papers (Fe-oxide Pi), Olsen, calcium-acetate-lactate (CAL), cation and anion exchange membranes (CAEM), Mehlich 3, Bray and Kurtz II (Bray II), citrate-bicarbonatedithionite, organic P, HCl, acid ammonium oxalate, total P. Plant P uptake was in the range of the P extracted by neutral salt solutions (CaCl2, LiCl). P extracted with H2O, CaCl2 and CAEM correlated best with plant P uptake over one growing season, while several established soil P test methods, including CAL, Mehlich 3 and Bray II, did not show significant correlations. When grouping the soils according to pH, the weaker extraction methods (H2O, CaCl2, LiCl) showed significant correlations with plant P uptake only for the low and intermediate pH groups (pH in 1 mol/L KCl <= 6.6), while some of the stronger extraction methods (CAL, Mehlich 3, Bray II, dithionite, oxalate, total P) showed significant correlations only for the high pH group (> 6.6) comprised of calcareous soils. It was concluded that weaker P extraction methods, especially neutral salt solutions best predict plant-available P in the short term. However, they do not perform well for calcareous (and clayey) soils and do not account for P that may become available beyond one growing season.

AB  - Efficient utilization of agricultural soil phosphorus (P) and mitigation of loss risks necessitate a precise evaluation of soil P storage capacity (SPSC). This study compared the effectiveness of four soil test P methods (Oxalate, Bray, Olsen, and Mehlich-1) to accurately estimate SPSC and simplify P loss risk assessment of soils located in a typical red soil in the Sunjia Watershed, Yingtan, Jiangxi Province, China. The extraction efficiencies of these methods for Fe, Al, P, and P saturation ratio (PSR) were compared, and conversion equations between SPSCOx (extracted using Oxalate) and soil test P (Bray, Olsen, and Mehlich-1) were derived through fitting analysis. The results underscored Oxalate as the optimal extractant for gauging P loss risk in red soils. Structural equation modeling (SEM) unveiled the substantial impact of amorphous iron-aluminum oxides (Fe-o, Al-o) on SPSC, with Fe-o exerting a more pronounced influence than Al-o. Among soil physicochemical properties, total carbon emerged as the most influential, and a strong interaction was noted between the physicochemical properties and Fe-o and Al-o. The study delineated three crucial P concentration ranges for practical P management in red soils. When Bray-P < 48.2 mg kg(-1), the soil acted as a P sink with no P loss risk, allowing for continued P application to augment crop yield. Conversely, within 48.2 mg kg(-1) < Bray-P <= 55.2 mg kg(-1), the soil attained its maximum secure P capacity; further P application significantly escalated the peril of P loss. Subsequently, when Bray-P > 55.2 mg kg(-1), the soil turns into a source of P release. This signifies an escalated risk of P loss, demanding the immediate implementation of environmental protective measures.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is a nutrient essential to living organisms and ecosystems. Accurate information regarding extractable soil P is necessary for agricultural management and environmental quality. Direct measurements of extractable soil P at large scales are usually impeded by considerable time, labour, and economic resources required for implementation. To meet agronomic and environmental monitoring needs, multiple extraction methods have been developed worldwide to estimate the different components of soil P. In France, three extraction methods are used, namely the Dyer method for acidic soils, Joret-Hebert for calcareous soils, and Olsen for all soils. Therefore, it is difficult to compare data obtained nationwide for monitoring purposes. Consequently, it is of significant importance to develop pedotransfer functions (PTFs) to harmonise extractable soil P data obtained from different extraction methods with the assistance of other easily available predictors from soil information systems. In this study, we used an extensive dataset from the French soil-monitoring programme for the calibration and evaluation of PTFs. We implemented the partial least squares regression to relate extractable P measured by the Dyer or Joret-Hebert method to extractable P determined by the Olsen method considering 14 soil properties (total P2O5, pH, cation exchange capacity (CEC), CaCO3, soil texture (clay, silt and sand contents), total organic carbon, and exchangeable Fe, Al, CaO, Mn, MgO, and K2O). We constructed patrimonial models by selecting the most important predictors. According to the results of 10 iterations cross-validation, the average R-2, root mean-square error (RMSE), and mean error (ME) of the PTF of calcareous soils were 0.66, 25.81, and -0.11 mg kg(-1), whereas those of acidic soils were 0.70, 24.02, and -0.87 mg kg(1), respectively. The Joret-Hebert P2O5, silt, pH, total P2O5, CEC, and K were the most important predictors for estimating Olsen P2O5 in calcareous soils, whereas Dyer P2O5, exchangeable Al, K, and pH were the most important predictors for estimating Olsen P2O5 in acidic soils. We observed that the explanatory power of the soil properties was more important in calcareous than in acidic soils. As expected, the proxies of Olsen P2O5, namely, Dyer P2O5 and Joret-Hebert P2O5, were the most important variables in modelling Olsen P2O5 variations. In addition, the relationship between Olsen P2O5 and Dyer P2O5 was much stronger than that between Olsen P2O5 and Joret-Hebert P2O5. The results confirmed the feasibility of estimating extractable P in soil by PTFs that were constructed using statistical methods, such as partial least squares regression. The addition of more predictors that are related to agricultural practices and topography attributes may improve the prediction accuracy.

AB  - Increasingly, model-based approaches play a role in the design and development of new land use systems. Simulation modeling may play a role in the generation of land use systems for land units, and optimization modeling ( e. g. linear programming - LP) may be used in the upscaling to farm and region. In the quantification of new land use systems for land units, often equilibrium conditions with respect to soil resources are assumed, following a so-called target-oriented approach. This facilitates ex ante computation of inputs and emissions of nutrients and allows their use in static optimization models based on LP. The condition of equilibrium in soil resources is often not met, nor is it the ultimate aim. Hence, the dynamics in new systems are insufficiently dealt with. This paper presents an approach for the design of land use systems ( crop rotations) and their quantification in terms of input and output coefficients, using particular yields and dynamics in soil resources as targets. Interactions between N input and output of succeeding crops are explicitly taken into account. A simple N-balance model is used describing major processes affecting soil N-dynamics. For the Koutiala region in Mali five crop rotations are evaluated that differ in target crop yield, crop choice, crop residue management and external N source. Modeled crop rotations aiming at high yields, in combination with incorporation of crop residues and legumes, result in depletion of soil N stock. Only in crop rotations aiming at high yields and with incorporation of crop residues combined with a supply of large quantities of animal manure, soil N depletion can be prevented. Four approaches are presented of how to use the dynamic input - output coefficients of these systems in land use studies using LP: (i) use of average coefficients, (ii) use of discounted coefficients, (iii) use of pessimistic estimates of coefficients in an optimization of the land use allocation followed by a recalculation of the objective values for the optimized land use with optimistic coefficients, and (iv) a combined use of systems characteristics, i. e. cumulative N-inputs of land use systems over the time horizon and the magnitude of the soil N pool at the end of the time horizon, which can be used as filters for land use systems. Though none of the approaches completely captures the dynamics in input - output coefficients, they enable a well-founded consideration of the consequences of dynamics in, for instance, soil N stocks in static optimization approaches for farm and regional studies.

AB  - Use of the Mehlich-3 soil extractant with an inductively coupled plasma emission spectroscopy (ICP) determination method (M3-ICP) is displacing the original colorimetry-based test (M3-COL). Current interpretations do not distinguish between these two versions, although the M3-ICP test often measures more P. This study correlated these tests and the Bray-P-1 (BP) test with corn (Zea mays L.) yield response at 59 Iowa locations (78 site-yr). The mean P measured by the M3-ICP, M3-COL, and BP tests was 31, 19, and 17 mg P kg(-1) respectively. The M3-ICP/M3-COL ratio decreased exponentially with increasing soil P (Pless than or equal to0.01) but their difference was not correlated with soil P. Relative or absolute differences tended to decrease linearly (Pless than or equal to0.01) with increasing soil pH or organic C, but the strength of the relationship was poor (R-2=0.14-0.32). The BP test measured significantly less P in a CaCO3-affected soil (pH 8.1). The R-2 of the relationship between M3-ICP and M3-COL was 0.84, and was 0.89 between the M3-COL and BP (0.97 excluding the site with pH 8.1). Critical concentrations defined by Cate-Nelson and linear-plateau models for the M3-ICP, W-COL, and BP tests were 20 to 32, 16 to 21, and 13 to 20 mg kg(-1), respectively. The M3-COL and M3-ICP are equally effective for Iowa soils but interpretations differ. The M3-ICP test should be considered a different test and its interpretations should be based on field calibrations rather than conversions based on M3-COL data. A range of 25 to 35 mg kg(-1) for the M3-ICP test would correspond to the optimum class (16-20 mg kg(-1)) used in Iowa for the M3-COL and BP tests.

AB  - Inappropriate fertilization management practices have led to low timber production in intensive plantation systems in China. Thus, optimized conventional or advanced fertilization management practices are needed. We aimed to quantify whether optimized furrow fertilization (FF) is comparable to advanced drip fertigation (DF) and to make recommendations regarding fertilization management strategies for poplar plantations. A completely randomized block design experiment with two fertilization methods (DF and FF) and four N application amounts (F-0: 0, F-1: 68, F-2: 113, and F-3: 158 kg N center dot ha(-1)center dot yr(-1)) was carried out on a Populus x euramericana cv. 'Guariento' plantation. Fine root biomass density (FRBD), fine root length density (FRLD), specific root length (SRL), soil total nitrogen (STN), soil inorganic nitrogen (SIN), soil ammonium (NH4+-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N) were measured. The productivity increment was calculated based on tree surveys. The results showed that FRBD and FRLD decreased with the soil depth, and more than 86% was distributed within the 40 cm soil depth. FRBD, FRLD, productivity increment and soil N increased with an increasing amount of N application. DF treatments achieved 117%, 94% and 10% higher FRBD, FRLD and productivity increments, respectively, than did FF treatments. The averages of STN, SIN, NH4+-N and NO3--N under FF were higher than those under DF, leading to higher concentrations of residual NO3--N in deep soil. Beneficial management practices for fine root growth were evaluated in the following order: water coupled with N > only N >= only water > control. FRBD was positively correlated with the productivity increment. Therefore, fine root extension to increase soil resource absorption yields greater productivity under DF treatments. Drip fertilization is recommended as a better fertilization method to greatly promote the growth of fine roots, as well as productivity and residual lower soil N for poplar plantations.

AB  - In arid or semi-arid ecosystems, water availability is one of the primary controls on vegetation growth. When subsurface water resources are unavailable, the vegetation growth is dictated by the rainfall, and the random nature of the rainfall arrivals and quantities induces a probability distribution of soil moisture and vegetation biomass via the coupled dynamic equations of biomass balance and water balance. We have previously obtained an exact solution for these distributions under certain conditions, and shown that the mapping of rainfall variability to observed biomass variability can be successfully applied to a field site. Here, we expand upon our earlier theoretical work to show how the dynamics can give rise to more complicated, bimodal (and multimodal) structures in the biomass distribution when positive feedbacks between growth and water availability are included. We also derive some new analytical results for the crossing properties of this system, which enable us to determine on what time scale the effects of these feedbacks will be felt, and, relatedly, how long the system will take to cross between different modes.

AB  - Soybean field experiments were performed to investigate the weed-suppressing effects of different tillage systems and cover crop mulches at two locations in southwest Germany during 2014 and 2015. The influence of three different tillage systems on weed control efficacy, soybean plant density, and crop yield was determined. In the no-till system (NT), two different cover crops, (rye and barley), were treated by a roller-crimper before soybean sowing. For the reduced tillage system (RT), shallow soil cultivation (7.5 cm depth) using a cultivator after cover crop harvest was performed. The third system was conventional tillage (CT), which used a plow (25 cm depth) without any previous cover crop treatment. Finally, a CT system without weed control was used as a control treatment (C). Weed densities in the field experiments ranged from 1 to 164 plants m(2) with Chenopodium album (L.), Echinochloa crus-galli (L.) P. Beauv., and Sonchus arvensis (L.) as the predominant weed species. No difference in weed suppression was found between the two cover crops. The highest cover crop soil coverage was measured in the NT treatment. The greatest weed density (164 plants m(2)) was measured in the untreated control. CT, RT and NT reduced weed density up to 71%, 85%, and 61%, respectively, to C, across both locations and years. Soybean plant density was reduced in NT (36%) and CT (18%) based on aimed sown plant density. Highest crop yields up to 2.4 t ha(-1) were observed in RT, while NT resulted in lower yields (1.1 t ha(-1)). Our work reveals the importance of cover crops for weed suppression in soybean cropping systems without herbicide application.

AB  - Dryland ecosystems commonly exhibit periodic bands of vegetation, thought to form due to competition between individual plants for heterogeneously distributed water. In this paper, we develop a Fourier method for locally identifying the pattern wavenumber and orientation, and apply it to aerial images from a region of vegetation patterning near Fort Stockton, TX, USA. We find that the local pattern wavelength and orientation are typically coherent, but exhibit both rapid and gradual variation driven by changes in hillslope gradient and orientation, the potential for water accumulation, or soil type. Endogenous pattern dynamics, when simulated for spatially homogeneous topographic and vegetation conditions, predict pattern properties that are much less variable than the orientation and wavelength observed in natural systems. Our local pattern analysis, combined with ancillary datasets describing soil and topographic variation, highlights a largely unexplored correlation between soil depth, pattern coherence, vegetation cover and pattern wavelength. It also, surprisingly, suggests that downslope accumulation of water may play a role in changing vegetation pattern properties.

AB  - To determine the impact of K fertilization on crop yields and soil K supplying capacity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) rotation, four field experiments were conducted with five K fertilizer rates: 0 (K0), 90-147 (K1), 180-210 (K2), 270-300 (K3) and 336-390 (K4) kg K2O ha(-1) per rotation. Compared with K0, adding K increased the yield of rice and oilseed rape by 4.2-8.9% and 7.5-32.6%, respectively. Potassium fertilization increased K uptake at four sites, whereas yields remained stagnant in K2, K3, and K4 treatments despite increasing K uptake. Continuous K removal decreased soil K supplying capacity. For the 0 to 20 cm and 20 to 40 cm soil depths, the NH4OAc-K and boiling HNO3-K at the harvest were decreased in K0 and K1 treatments, whereas it maintained or increased in K2, K3, and K4 treatments, although negative K balances were recorded at all sites. It suggests that application 180-210 kg K2O ha(-1) in rice-oilseed rape cropping systems improved crop yield and maintained soil potassium fertility.

AB  - The incorporation of specific regional hydrological characteristics in empirical statistical landslide threshold models has considerable potential to improve the quality of landslide predictions towards reliable early warning systems. The objective of this research was to test the value of regional groundwater level information, as a proxy for water storage fluctuations, to improve regional landslide predictions with empirical models based on the concept of threshold levels. Specifically, we investigated (i) the use of a data-driven time series approach to model the regional groundwater levels based on short duration monitoring observations and (ii) the predictive power of single variable and bilinear threshold landslide prediction models derived from groundwater levels and precipitation. Based on statistical measures of the model fit (R-2 and RMSE), the groundwater level dynamics estimated by the transfer function noise time series model are broadly consistent with the observed groundwater levels. The single variable threshold models derived from groundwater levels exhibited the highest landslide prediction power with 82 %-93 % of true positive alarms despite the quite high rate of false alarms with about 26 %-38 %. The further combination as bilinear threshold models reduced the rate of false alarms by about 18 %-28 % at the expense of reduced true alarms by about 9 %-29 % and is thus less advantageous than single variable threshold models. In contrast to precipitation-based thresholds, relying on threshold models exclusively defined using hydrological variables such as groundwater can lead to improved landslide predictions due to their implicit consideration of long-term antecedent conditions until the day of landslide occurrence.

AB  - Pluvial flash floods are among the most dangerous weather-triggered disasters, usually affecting watersheds smaller than 100 km(2), with a short time to peak discharge (from a few minutes to a few hours) after causative rainfall. Several warning systems in the world try to use this time lag to predict the location, extent, intensity, and time of flash flooding. They are based on numerical hydrological models processing data collected by on-ground monitoring networks, weather radars, and precipitation nowcasting. However, there may be areas covered by weather radar data, in which the network of ground-based precipitation stations is not sufficiently developed or does not even exist (e.g., in an area covered by portable weather radar). We developed a method usable for designing an early warning system based on a different philosophy for such a situation. This method uses weather radar data as a 2D signal carrying information on the current precipitation distribution over the monitored area, and data on the watershed and drainage network in the area. The method transforms (concentrates) the 2D signal on precipitation distribution into a 1D signal carrying information on potential runoff distribution along the drainage network. For sections of watercourses where a significant increase in potential runoff can be expected (i.e., a significant increase of the 1D signal strength is detected), a warning against imminent flash floods can be possibly issued. The whole curve of the potential runoff development is not essential for issuing the alarm, but only the significant leading edge of the 1D signal is important. The advantage of this procedure is that results are obtained quickly and independent of any on-ground monitoring system; the disadvantage is that it does not provide the exact time of the onset of a flash flooding or its extent and intensity. The generated alert only warns that there is a higher flash flooding hazard in a specific section of the watercourse in the coming hours. The forecast is presented as a dynamic map of the flash flooding hazard distribution along the segments of watercourses. Relaying this hazard to segments of watercourses permits a substantial reduction in false alarms issued to not-endangered municipalities, which lie in safe areas far away from the watercourses. The method was tested at the local level (pluvial flash floods in two small regions of the Czech Republic) and the national level for rainfall episodes covering large areas in the Czech Republic. The conclusion was that the method is applicable at both levels. The results were compared mainly with data related to the Fire and Rescue Service interventions during floods. Finally, the increase in the reliability of hazard prediction using the information on soil saturation is demonstrated. The method is applicable in any region covered by a weather radar (e.g., a portable one), even if there are undeveloped networks of rain and hydrometric gauge stations. Further improvement could be achieved by processing more extended time series and using computational intelligence methods for classifying the degree of flash flooding hazard on individual sections of the watercourse network.

AB  - We investigated the predictability (forecast skill) of short-term droughts using the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI). We incorporated a sophisticated data training (of decadal range) to evaluate the improvement of forecast skill of short-term droughts (3 months). We investigated whether the data training of the synthetic North American Multi-Model Ensemble (NMME) climate has some influence on enhancing short-term drought predictability. The central elements are the merged information among PDSI and NMME with two postprocessing techniques. 1) The bias correction-spatial disaggregation (BC-SD) method improves spatial resolution by using a refined soil information introduced in the available water capacity of the PDSI calculation to assess water deficit that better estimates drought variability. 2) The ensemble model output statistic (EMOS) approach includes systematically trained decadal information of the multimodel ensemble simulations. Skill of drought forecasting improves when using EMOS, but BC-SD does not increase the forecast skill when compared with an analysis using BC (low spatial resolution). This study suggests that predictability forecast of drought (PDSI) can be extended without any change in the core dynamics of the model but instead by using the sophisticated EMOS postprocessing technique. We pointed out that using NMME without any postprocessing is of limited use in the suite of model variations of the NMME, at least for the U.S. Northeast. From our analysis, 1 month is the most extended range we should expect, which is below the range of the seasonal scale presented with EMOS (2 months). Thus, we propose a new design of drought forecasts that explicitly includes the multimodel ensemble signal.

AB  - Vegetation plays an important role in improving slope stability. It is crucial to develop simple and effective methods for assessing the stability of vegetated slopes. Based on upper bound limit analysis, a method was proposed to analyse the stability of a two-dimensional vegetated slope with uniform root architectures under steady transpiration state. The effects of water absorption and reinforcement by vegetation roots on slope stability were considered using this method. Parametric studies were performed to investigate the effects of the soil type, root depth, plant transpiration rate, root tensile strength, slope angle and internal friction angle on slope stability. Several generic stability plots were provided. The results showed that roots significantly improved soil cohesion but slightly affected the internal friction angle. Root systems could provide additional soil cohesion. Horizontally and vertically distributed roots imposed the best mechanical reinforcement effect on the soil. The shear strength increases by 1.78 times. Compared with that of plain soils, the critical state line (CSL) of the root-soil composite moved upwards. The soil type strongly influences the pore water pressure. With increasing plant transpiration rate, root tensile strength and root depth, vegetated slope stability can increase by 58 %. The slope stability decreases by 50 % with increasing slope angle. The stability number (Ns) decreases with increasing internal friction angle. The effects of water absorption and reinforcement by roots on slope stability decrease with increasing desaturation coefficient and saturated permeability coefficient. Compared with that of loess and sand slopes, the reinforcement effect of vegetation roots is more significant for the stability of clay slopes.

AB  - Successful irrigated agriculture is underpinned by answering two critical questions: when and how much to irrigate. This article quantifies the role of the Chameleon and the Wetting Front Detector, monitoring tools facilitating decision-making and learning about soil-water-nutrient dynamics. Farmers retained nutrients in the root zone by reducing irrigation frequency, number of siphons, and event duration. Water productivity increased by more than 100% for farmers both with and without monitoring tools. Transitioning smallholder irrigation systems into profitable and sustainable schemes requires investment in technology, farmers and institutions. Importantly, technologies need embedding in a learning environment that fosters critical feedback mechanisms, such as market constraints.

AB  - Regional prevalence of soybean Sclerotinia stem rot (SSR), caused by Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, was modeled using management practices (tillage, herbicide, manure and fertilizer application, and seed treatment with fungicide) and summer weather variables (mean monthly air temperature and precipitation for the months of June, July, August, and September) as inputs. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the probability of stem rot prevalence with disease data from four states in the north-central region of the United States (Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, and Ohio). Goodness-of-fit criteria indicated that the resulting model explained well the observed frequency of occurrence. The relationship of management practices and weather variables with soybean yield was examined using multiple linear regression (R-2 = 0.27). Variables significant to SSR prevalence, including average air temperature during July and August, precipitation during July, tillage, seed treatment, liquid manure, fertilizer, and herbicide applications, were also associated with high attainable yield. The results suggested that SSR occurrence in the north-central region of the United States was associated with environments of high potential yield. Farmers' decisions about SSR management, when the effect of management practices on disease prevalence and expected attainable yield was taken into account, were examined. Bayesian decision procedures were used to combine information from our model (prediction) with farmers' subjective estimation of SSR incidence (personal estimate, based on farmers' previous experience with SSR incidence). MAXIMIN and MAXIMAX criteria were used to incorporate farmers' site-specific past experience with SSR incidence, and optimum actions were derived using the criterion of profit maximization. Our results suggest that management practices should be applied to increase attainable yield despite their association with high disease risk.

AB  - Hydrologic models are conventionally constrained and evaluated using point measurements of streamflow, which represent an aggregated catchment measure. As a consequence of this single objective focus, model parametrization and model parameter sensitivity typically do not reflect other aspects of catchment behavior. Specifically for distributed models, the spatial pattern aspect is often overlooked. Our paper examines the utility of multiple performance measures in a spatial sensitivity analysis framework to determine the key parameters governing the spatial variability of predicted actual evapotranspiration (AET). The Latin hypercube one-at-a-time (LHS-OAT) sampling strategy with multiple initial parameter sets was applied using the mesoscale hydrologic model (mHM) and a total of 17 model parameters were identified as sensitive. The results indicate different parameter sensitivities for different performance measures focusing on temporal hydrograph dynamics and spatial variability of actual evapotranspiration. While spatial patterns were found to be sensitive to vegetation parameters, streamflow dynamics were sensitive to pedo-transfer function (PTF) parameters. Above all, our results show that behavioral model definitions based only on streamflow metrics in the generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) type methods require reformulation by incorporating spatial patterns into the definition of threshold values to reveal robust hydrologic behavior in the analysis.

AB  - Flash floods are listed among the deadliest and costliest weather-driven hazard worldwide. Yet, only a few systems to predict flash floods run operationally in Europe. Recently, the European Precipitation Index based on Climatology (EPIC) was developed and then set up for daily flash flood early warning for an area covering most of the continent. EPIC is a purely rainfall-driven indicator based on the prediction of statistical threshold exceedence of the upstream precipitation to provide early warning up to 5days in advance. Its main assumption is that flash floods are directly and solely related to extreme accumulations of upstream precipitation. It does not take into account any geo-factors such as slope and land use or processes such as initial soil moisture, which can have a significant impact on the triggering of such events. This study proposes an enhanced version of EPIC through a dynamic and distributed runoff co-efficient which depends on the initial soil moisture. This co-efficient, namely the European Runoff Index based on Climatology (ERIC), is used to weigh each contribution of the upstream precipitation proportionally to the initial soil moisture. The evaluation based on 1year of daily runs proved that ERIC reaches a threat score of 0.5 if it forecasts a probability >35% of exceeding the 20year return period of upstream runoff. This result is 0.16 higher than for EPIC. A case study of the flash flooding affecting central Europe in June 2013 demonstrated the ability of ERIC to successfully detect and locate the affected areas.

AB  - Cover crops offer environmental and agricultural benefits, but adoption remains low. Soybean growers have indicated that the adoption of rye as a winter cover crop would increase, if it was shown to offer suppression of a key soybean pest, the soybean aphid Aphis glycines. We performed an on-farm evaluation of two cropping systems utilized in organic production and reduced-herbicide input production. One system includes a rye cover crop, whereas the other does not. At six and five location-years in Minnesota, A. glycines and predator populations, respectively, were measured and compared between the systems with and without rye. The system with the rye cover crop significantly suppressed A. glycines populations on soybean at five of six location-years. Predators appeared to respond more to prey abundance than to plant diversity. An exposure analysis examining biological control potential revealed no differences between soybean with and without rye at any location-year. Insect control can be added to the multiple benefits of rye winter cover crops.

AB  - The effect of management systems and crop rotation on soil phosphorus (P) fractions and selected soil properties were studied from 2002 to 2005 on an experiment established in 2001 in a volcanic derived Ultisol from southern Chile. Two tillage systems, no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT), and two crop rotations, oat-wheat and white lupine-wheat were evaluated in order to determine the effects of such management in the lability of P in this soil. Seasonal additions of phosphate fertilizer at a rate of 80 kg P ha(-1), to oat and lupine, and 200 kg P ha(-1) to wheat were applied to the high P fixing soil used. Soil analyses were performed each year after growing season. Total P increased from 1643 to 2053 mg kg(-1) after 4 years of cultivation but most of this added P (72%) became unavailable. The application of the Hedley P fractionation procedure indicated that P was mainly distributed as relatively labile P, extractable with NaOH (43.5% of the total P), and that only 9.6% was labile P, extractable with resin and NaHCO3. In NT soils the largest soil surface P accumulation was produced, mainly as inorganic P. In the oat-wheat rotation, the largest accumulation of moderate labile organic P was observed, preventing it from becoming unavailable; the lupine-wheat rotation left the greatest phosphatase activity in soil (738 mu g PNFF g(-1)). Tillage and crop rotation exerted the same level of effects on labile+ relatively labile P fractions (F-probabilifies of 0.045 and 0.040, respectively), but cropping systems affected the soil properties much more. Over fertilization caused high levels of soluble P (66 mg kg-1 of resin extractable P in the last year), but also promoted the P accumulation under unavailable fractions, especially in CT systems. Wheat cropping resulted in a greater accumulation of soil total P and no labile P; whereas oat and particularly lupine cropping showed a reduction of no labile P and an increase of relatively labile P.

AB  - Field experiments were conducted to investigate an appropriate saline water management strategy to enhance the yield and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) of drip-irrigated onion. The effects on soil water-salt dynamics, growth parameters, IWUE and yield were assessed under different lateral spacings and irrigation treatments. The different treatments comprised two lateral spacings (45 and 60 cm) and four irrigation treatments (canal water, C; conjunctive use of canal and saline water in a 1:1 ratio, C1S1; in a 1:2 ratio, C1S2; and saline water, S). The results show that soil moisture content decreased vertically downwards and radially outwards in all treatments, whereas soil salinity increased and decreased with increasing radial distance and soil depth, respectively, throughout the soil profile irrespective of the lateral spacing and irrigation treatments. The maximum yield and IWUE were observed at 45-cm lateral spacing for treatment C, followed by C1S1, C1S2 and S. It was concluded that the C1S1 treatment can be employed successfully for onion cultivation in sandy loam soil without any significant reduction in yield. The present study highlights the significance of irrigation treatments and lateral spacing for maximum production, which may be used as a baseline/guideline to increase the income of onion growers/farmers in semi-arid regions.
   Des experiences menees sur le terrain etudient une strategie appropriee de la gestion de l'eau saline afin d'ameliorer le rendement et l'efficacite de l'utilisation de l'eau d'irrigation (IWUE) d'oignons irrigues au goutte a goutte. Les effets sur la dynamique de l'eau et des sels du sol, les parametres de croissance, l'IWUE et le rendement ont ete evalues dans le cadre de differents espacements lateraux et traitements d'irrigation. Les differents traitements comprenaient deux espacements lateraux (45 et 60 cm) et quatre traitements d'irrigation (eau de canal, C; utilisation conjonctive de l'eau des canaux et de l'eau saline dans un rapport 1:1, C1S1; dans un rapport 1:2, C1S2 et eau saline, S). Les resultats montrent que la teneur en humidite du sol a diminue verticalement vers le bas et radialement vers l'exterieur dans tous les traitements, tandis que la salinite du sol a augmente et a diminue avec l'augmentation de la distance radiale et de la profondeur du sol, respectivement, dans tout le profil du sol, independamment de l'espacement lateral et des traitements d'irrigation. Le rendement maximal et l'IWUE ont ete observes a un espacement lateral de 45 cm pour le traitement C, suivi des traitements C1S1, C1S2, et S. il a ete conclu que le traitement C1S1 peut etre utilise avec succes pour la culture d'oignons dans des sols sablonneux riche en terreau sans reduction significative du rendement. La presente etude met en evidence l'importance des traitements d'irrigation et de l'espacement lateral pour la production maximale, qui peuvent etre utilises comme reference/ligne directrice pour augmenter le revenu des producteurs d'oignons dans les regions semi-arides.

AB  - This article presents the results obtained by analyzing the data traffic that originated in a system with intelligent soil moisture sensors (Wireless Sensor Network-WSN) that transmit through a wireless network. This study sought to integrate smart agriculture and IoT (Internet of Things) applications in potato crops in various rural settings. Using these measurements, the data analysis was performed through the ARIMA (autoregressive integrated moving average model) and SARIMA (seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average model) time series following the Box-Jenkins methodology. GRETL (Gnu Regression, Econometrics and Time-series Library) free software was used to generate a teletraffic behavior prediction model in a larger-scale implementation. The main objective was the creation of a model that allows an analysis and simulation about the behavior of the main performance parameters that a medium-scale WSN system would have for the monitoring of a crop. Thanks to this analysis, it will be possible to determine the technical characteristics that a sensor deployment should have in a specific area and for a specific crop.

AB  - The Noah land surface model with multiple parameterization options (Noah-MP) includes a routine for the dynamic simulation of vegetation carbon assimilation and soil carbon decomposition processes. To use remote sensing observations of vegetation to constrain simulations from this model, it is necessary first to understand the sensitivity of the model to its parameters. This is required for efficient parameter estimation, which is both a valuable way to use observations and also a first or concurrent step in many state-updating data assimilation procedures. We use variance decomposition to assess the sensitivity of estimates of sensible heat, latent heat, soil moisture, and net ecosystem exchange made by certain standard Noah-MP configurations that include the dynamic simulation of vegetation and carbon to 43 primary user-specified parameters. This is done using 32 years' worth of data from 10 international FluxNet sites. Findings indicate that there are five soil parameters and six (or more) vegetation parameters (depending on the model configuration) that act as primary controls on these states and fluxes.

AB  - An estimate of total potassium (K) contents of soils is required to assess the difficultly available fractions of soil potassium. Three digestion procedures were evaluated in terms of recovery of elemental K, precision, and simplicity in combination with analysis of K contents by inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES) in soils derived from contrasting parent materials. A hydrofluoric acid-perchloric acid (HClO4)-nitric acid (HNO3) mixture extracted the most K from 10 soils studied (4809.9 mg kg-1) followed by aqua regia (3180.89 mg kg-1) and HClO4-HNO3 mixtures (1206.75 mg kg-1). On average, aqua regia and HClO4-HNO3 digestion methods extracted 66.1% and 25.1% of the K extracted with the HF-HClO4-HNO3 mixture, respectively. Precision analysis as percentage of relative standard deviation showed excellent precision (5%) for the HF-HClO4-HNO3 method (1.49%) compared to the HClO4-HNO3 mixture (10.72%). The present study concludes that the HF-HClO4-HNO3 digestion mixture is superior over both aqua regia and HClO4-HNO3 mixtures for total K estimation in the soils of Central Highland provinces of Papua New Guinea especially when ICP-OES is employed for analysis.

AB  - Fertilizer placement is oft en designed to improve nutrient availability. Our objective was to determine the effect of P and K rate and placement in no-till and strip-till on grain yield; water, P, and K values in the soil; and the distribution of corn (Zea mays L.) roots. A 4-yr field experiment was setup near Urbana, IL, with a corn-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] rotation. Tillage/fertilizer placement was the main plot [no-till/broadcast (NTBC), no-till/deep band (NTDB), and strip-till/deep band (STDB)]; deep band was 15-cm beneath the crop row. Phosphorus fertilizer rate (0, 12, 24, and 36 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1)) was the subplot, and K-fertilizer rate (0, 42, 84, and 168 kg Kha(-1) yr(-1)) was the sub-subplot. Measurements included grain yield and yield components, grain and shoot P and K concentrations, root parameters, and soil-water, P, and K values. Strip-till/deep band produced greater kernels row(-1) and 9.43 Mg ha(-1) yield that was 7.8% greater than NTBC and 7.9% greater than NTDB. Deep banding increased soil P and K test values beneath the crop row and lowered soil surface test values compared with broadcast applications, but had no effect on root distribution. Across treatments, greatest apparent P and K uptake occurred in the surface layer where most roots were present and where precipitation replenished water to a greater extent than deeper layers. Relative to NTBC, STDB had 24% greater apparent-P and 23% greater apparent-K uptake rates. The results indicate that improved conditions for nutrient uptake provide a competitive advantage for production with STDB relative to no-till treatments.

AB  - Legumes have been shown to enhance bioavailability of phosphorus (P) from sparingly soluble pools, yet this functional trait remains underutilized in agriculture, and is untested at decadal scales. Management and legume presence effects on temporal soil properties were evaluated in a 17-year field crop experiment using soil samples collected in 1992, 2000 and 2006. Management systems compared included: (1) conventional corn-soybean-wheat rotation (C-S-W), (2) organic (C-S-W+red clover), (3) alfalfa and (4) early successional field. To evaluate the effects of long-term management versus recent management (residues and P fertilizer) on P and bio-availability to soybean, subplots of soybean were established with and without P-fertilizer (30kgPha(-1)), and compared to subplots and main plot with the long-term system. We evaluated soil properties (C, total P, Bray extractable inorganic P, particulate organic matter phosphorus) and soybean P uptake, biomass and yield. Recent fertilizer P inputs had no detectable influence on soil P, and total soil P stayed stable at 350mgPkg(-1), whereas inorganic P (Pi) declined from an initial value of 54 to an average of 35mgPkg(-1). A P balance was constructed and showed a net loss of -96.7kgPha(-1)yr(-1) for the organic system, yet Bray-Pi and soybean P uptake were maintained under organic production at similar levels to the conventional, fertilized system. Particulate organic matter P was 57, 82 and 128% higher in organic, alfalfa and successional treatments, respectively, compared to conventional. A similar pattern was observed for soil C, soybean yield and bioavailable P, which were 20-50% higher in the organic, alfalfa and successional systems relative to conventional. This study provides evidence that long-term management history influences bioavailability of P.

AB  - Low-grade weirs are innovative management strategies that control surface drainage, slow water velocities, and encourage sedimentation in agricultural drainage ditches. There is little information on how low-grade weirs perform in terms of short-term (0-12 months) sediment retention and associated phosphorus (P) dynamics. This study documents initial results of sediment and P dynamics of low-grade weirs in a drainage system that was built in a two-stage ditch design. Average sediment deposition did not differ significantly among sites (chi(2)=2.42; P=0.49); however, average water depths behind weir sites were significantly greater (28 +/- 10 cm) than the comparison inflow site (6 +/- 8 cm; chi(2)=7.67; P=0.05). Total P concentrations were not significantly different through time, or between sites, but there was a general trend of progressively higher total P retention moving downstream. Bioavailability ratios of P (i.e., the ratio of potentially bioavailable to non-bioavailable P fractions) were similar between all sites through time (chi(2)=2.09; P=0.55). The only variables correlated significantly with time were found at the inflow site, where water depth significantly decreased with corresponding increases in sediment/water column pH and bioavailability ratios. From best management practice installation to 12 months after construction, there was a lack of significant correlations with any measured variables behind weirs. However, the lack of correlation between variables suggests increasing the hydroperiod, reducing the ephemeral nature of the drainage ditch system, and prolonging inundation, improves conditions for P retention.

AB  - An upward trend in soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) concentrations in Northern Ireland rivers leading to increased entrophication has been reported for the last two decades. To identify if a similar trend could be observed in land drainage waters SRP and other P fractions were measured weekly from 1989 to 1997 in land drainage from a 9-ha grassland catchment in Northern Ireland that had a mean P surplus applied of 23.4 kg P ha(-1)yr(-1). Regressions of annual median concentrations of P fractions in land drainage waters against time for 1989 through to 1997 showed significant increases of SRP and soluble unreactive phosphorus (SUP) of 2.4 and 1.2 mug P L-1 yr(-1), respectively. However, the annual flow-weighted concentrations and loads of all P fractions did not show significant increases with time. During the period 1998-2000 a change of management was introduced when only maintenance dressings of P were applied to the catchment according to Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food guidelines. This resulted in significant reductions in SRP concentrations in 2000 compared with 1997.

AB  - Phosphorus and potassium are essential nutrients for plant growth and development. Plants will achieve optimum biomass and production if phosphorus and potassium needs are met through fertilization. Determining the availability of phosphorus and potassium in the soil is essential because it is related to decisions on phosphorus and potassium fertilizer rate recommendations. In this study, we evaluated 5 common phosphorus and potassium extraction methods by correlating the indicated soil nutrient levels to the relative biomass dry weight of tomato plants. The phosphorus and potassium extraction methods used were Mehlich-1, Bray-1, Morgan-Wolf, Ammonium acetate, and HCl-25%. Mean Root Error (MRE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) were used to determine the precision of the linear regression equation model in predicting the relationship between phosphorus and potassium soil extraction methods and the relative biomass dry weight of tomato plants. The correlation of the soil extraction methods used in Andisols with the relative biomass dry weight of tomato was highly significant and very strong (r > 0.75) suggesting that Bray-1 was the best soil-phosphorus extraction method (P-r = 0.88; P-MRE = 0.10; P-RMSE = 4.44), while HCl-25% was the most suitable for soil-potassium extraction (K-r = 0.90; K-MRE = 0.05; K-RMSE = 2.95). The results of the two extraction methods will be used to determine the dosage of phosphorus and potassium fertilizers (nutrient sufficiency approach) for tomato plants grown in Andisols.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) imports-exports budgets were estimated at four locations, each with 20 farmer-managed fields for two years in a semi-arid Tanzania and Malawi. The N-15 isotope dilution method was used to quantify BNF by three pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millspp.) varieties intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.). The N and P accumulation in plant components of sole maize and intercrops of maize-pigeonpea systems were used to estimate the mean exports and imports of N and P. The proportion of N derived from air (%Ndfa) by the pigeonpea varieties ranged from 93.8% to 99.9% in Malawi and 65.6% to 99.3% in Tanzania. The amount of fixed N (BNF; kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) varied from 37.5 to 117.2 in Malawi and 6.3 to 71.5 in Tanzania. The mean values for BNF during the two cropping seasons were 64.3 for Nyambi, 85.3 for Ntonda, 34.1 for Gairo and -54.3 for Babati sites. The mean N budget (kg ha(-1)) was -26.1 in the sole maize plots and -40.3 for the intercrops at the two locations in Malawi, and -50.1 in the sole crop plots and -51.1 in the intercrops at the locations in Tanzania. In a scenario where all the aboveground material except the edible parts was returned to the soil, a positive value of 30.5 kg N for the intercrops was recorded compared with -8.9 kg N for the sole maize in Malawi. For the same scenario in Tanzania, the budget was more negative (-35.4 kg N) for sole maize compared with intercrops (-5.9 kg N). Including the roots in the calculations, did not change the differences between mono and intercrops. The P budget was negative irrespective of whether the aboveground biomass of maize and pigeonpea was incorporated or exported out of the fields, and the values were similar for intercrops and sole maize. The most negative N and P budgets were recorded in the two study areas where the extractable soil P status of the soils and the maize yields were high. These findings indicate that pigeonpea incorporated into maize-based cropping systems will maintain a very high %Ndfa ( > 90%) in all plant parts and thereby contribute to improved N budgets but not increase the proportion of P mined of the soil.

AB  - 1. The nature of the relationship between water limitation and facilitation has been one of the most contentious debates surrounding the stress-gradient hypothesis (SGH), which states that plant-plant interactions shift from competition to facilitation with increasing environmental stress.
   2. We take a closer look at the potential role of soil moisture in mediating plant-plant interaction outcomes by assessing effects of climate and soil texture on plant modulation of soil moisture.
   3. Using an empirically-parameterized soil moisture model, we simulated soil moisture dynamics beneath shrubs and in un-vegetated coarse and fine soils for 1000 sites in the Western United States with < 700 mm mean annual precipitation. This threshold reflects the transition from dryland (< 600 mm precipitation) to mesic ecosystems.
   4. Positive effects of shrubs on shallow soil moisture (i.e. the difference between shrub and interspace soil moisture) decreased along the aridity gradient when long-term average conditions were considered, contrary to expectations based on the SGH. Negative effects of shrubs on deeper soil moisture also increased with aridity.
   5. However, when extreme years were considered, positive effects of shrub on soil moisture were greatest at intermediate points along the spatial aridity gradient, consistent with a humpbacked model of plant-plant interactions.
   6. When viewed through time within a site, shrub effects on shallow soil moisture were positively related to precipitation, with more complex relationships exhibited in deeper soils
   7. Taken together, the results of this simulation study suggest that plant effects on soil moisture are predictable based on relatively general relationships between precipitation inputs and differential evaporation and transpiration rates between plant and interspace microsites that are largely driven by temperature. In particular, this study highlights the importance of differentiating between temporal and spatial variation in weather and climate, respectively, in determining plant effects on available soil moisture. Rather than focusing on the somewhat coarse-scale predictions of the SGH, it may be more beneficial to explicitly incorporate plant effects on soil moisture into predictive models of plant-plant interaction outcomes in drylands.

In this study, we applied an integrated watershed modeling framework to examine the impacts of projected climate on runoff, soil moisture, and soil erosion under different management systems in Central Oklahoma. The proposed model uses measured climate data and three downscaled ensembles from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) at the water resources and erosion watershed to understand the impact of climate change and various climate conditions under three management systems: (1) continuous winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) under conventional tillage (WW-CT; baseline system), (2) continuous winter wheat under no-till (WW-NT), and (3) cool and warm season forage cover crop mixes under no-till (CC-NT). The study indicates that the occurrence of agricultural drought is projected to increase while erosion rates will remain unchanged under the WW-CT. In contrast, climate simulations imposed on the WW-NT and CC-NT systems significantly reduce runoff and sediment while preserving soil moisture levels. Especially, implementing the CC-NT system can bolster food security and foster sustainable farming practices in Central Oklahoma in the face of a changing climate.
   The projected climate showed an increase in Ta (1.7-2.1 degrees C) and potential evapotranspiration (6%-7%) and a reduction in P (3%-10%). The projected climate-depleted soil moisture levels (3%-6%) in the continuous winter wheat under conventional tillage (WW-CT) system in the study area. A non-significant change in erosion rate in the WW-CT system under the projected climate. Forage cover crop mixes reduced surface runoff (57%-73%) and soil erosion (87%-91%) while preserving soil moisture.
   In the face of global warming's impact on crop growth, it is crucial to adapt our farming methods effectively. This study investigated how projected climate conditions affect surface water flow, soil moisture, and soil erosion in the Southern Plains region. Using computer simulations, we studied three different farming methods: (1) continuous winter wheat under conventional tillage (baseline system), (2) continuous winter wheat under no-till, and (3) cool and warm season forage cover crop mixes under no-till. The results showed that with the baseline system, there is a projected increase in low water availability for crops, and soil erosion remains a concern. The other two systems can significantly reduce the flow of water and sediment while conserving soil moisture in soils. Especially, incorporating cover crops could increase productivity and foster sustainable farming practices in Central Oklahoma.

AB  - Measuring and improving resiliency is the key goal of climate risk management in rainfed agriculture. Currently, available metrics are generally used to qualitatively measure the resilience of agricultural systems at broader scales. Moreover, these metrics showed non-linear responses to climate variability, thus often fail to capture the temporal dynamics of resilience at field scales. Our objective for this study is to combine a few soil moisturebased metrics to gauge the resiliency of three promising rainfed agricultural treatments, namely the no-till, organic, and reduced input treatments against the conventional treatment. These treatments have been established at the Kellogg Biological Station Long-Term Ecological Research (KBS-LTER) experiment in a randomized complete block design with six blocks per treatment. All four of these treatments consisted of maize (Zea mays)soybean (Glycine max)-winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) in rotation. Long-term (1993-2018) soil moisture data from this experiment was collected to compute the soil moisture metrics while the total crop biomass, crop yield, and soil organic carbon data were statistically analyzed to evaluate the robustness of the metrics to gauge the resiliency of these systems. Results have shown that, among the soil moisture metrics, the mean relative difference, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, and soil water deficit index were suitable, while the index of temporal stability was not suitable to gauge the resiliency of different rainfed agricultural systems. The no-till treatment was identified as the most resilient treatment in terms of soil moisture retention, effectiveness for drought mitigation, and crop yields. Meanwhile, the reduced input treatment was the least resilient in terms of soil water conservation and drought recovery. The results of this study can be extended to other Midwest regions of the United States and similar climatological areas around the world.

AB  - Continuously flooded rice systems are a major contributor to global rice production and food security. Allowing the soil to dry periodically during the growing season (such as with alternate wetting and drying irrigation AWD) has been shown to decrease methane emissions, water usage, and heavy metal accumulation in rice grain. However, the effects of AWD on rice yields are variable and not well understood. A two-year study was established to quantify the impacts of a range of treatments differing in AWD severity (degree of soil drying between flooding events) on yield (as well as factors that may affect yields), soil hydrology in the soil profile, and grain arsenic (As) concentrations relative to a continuously flooded control (CF). Three AWD treatments of increasing severity were imposed between full canopy cover (around 45 days after sowing) and 50% heading: AWD-Safe (field was reflooded when the perched water table reached 15 cm below the soil surface) and AWD35 and AWD25 (field was reflooded when the soil volumetric water content at 0-15 cm depth reached 35% and 25%, respectively). During the drying periods, the 0-15 cm soil layer in the AWD-Safe remained saturated, whereas in AWD35 and AWD25 the soil dried to the desired volumetric water contents. In contrast, soil moisture at 25-35 cm below the soil surface was similar across all treatments. Yield was not reduced in any of the AWD treatments, compared to the CF control. There were no consistent differences in yield components, C-13 discrimination, and N dynamics. Results suggest that the availability of water and the presence of roots at the 25-35 cm soil depth during the drying periods ensured that the crop did not suffer drought stress and thus yields were maintained. Grain As concentration in the AWD-Safe treatment was similar to that in the CF control but decreased by 56-68% in AWD35 and AWD25. AWD-Safe is often promoted as a means of practicing AWD without reducing yields; however, in this study this practice did not reduce grain As concentration because the soil did not reach an unsaturated state. These findings demonstrate that knowledge of surface and subsurface hydrology, and the root system are important for understanding the potential of AWD.

AB  - The North Wyke Farm Platform was established as a United Kingdom national capability for collaborative research, training and knowledge exchange in agro-environmental sciences. Its remit is to research agricultural productivity and ecosystem responses to different management practices for beef and sheep production in lowland grasslands. A system based on permanent pasture was implemented on three 21-ha farmlets to obtain baseline data on hydrology, nutrient cycling and productivity for 2 years. Since then two farmlets have been modified by either (i) planned reseeding with grasses that have been bred for enhanced sugar content or deep-rooting traits or (ii) sowing grass and legume mixtures to reduce nitrogen fertilizer inputs. The quantities of nutrients that enter, cycle within and leave the farmlets were evaluated with data recorded from sensor technologies coupled with more traditional field study methods. We demonstrate the potential of the farm platform approach with a case study in which we investigate the effects of the weather, field topography and farm management activity on surface runoff and associated pollutant or nutrient loss from soil. We have the opportunity to do a full nutrient cycling analysis, taking account of nutrient transformations in soil, and flows to water and losses to air. The NWFP monitoring system is unique in both scale and scope for a managed land-based capability that brings together several technologies that allow the effect of temperate grassland farming systems on soil moisture levels, runoff and associated water quality dynamics to be studied in detail.

AB  - Soil moisture plays a vital role in land surface energy and the water cycle. Microwave remote sensing is widely used because of the physically based relationship between the land surface emission observed and soil moisture. However, the application of retrieved soil moisture data is restricted by its coarse spatial resolution. To overcome this weakness, downscaling methods should be developed to disaggregate coarse resolution microwave soil moisture data to fine resolution. The traditional method is the microwave-optical/IR synergistic approach, in which land surface temperature, vegetation index, and surface albedo are key parameters. Five purely empirical methods based on the triangle feature are selected in this study. To evaluate their performance on downscaling microwave soil moisture, these methods are applied to the Zoige Plateau in China using the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture product and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) optical/IR products. The coarse-resolution AMSR-E LPRM soil moisture data are disaggregated into the high resolution of the MODIS product, and the surface soil moisture measurements of the Maqu soil moisture observation network located in the plateau are used to validate the downscaling results. Results show that (1) the relationship models used in these methods can generally capture the variation in soil moisture, with R-2 around 0.6, but have a relatively high uncertainty under conditions of high soil moisture; (2) the methods can provide high-resolution soil moisture distribution, but the downscaled soil moisture presents a low level correlation with field measurements at different spatial and temporal scales. This comparative study provides insight into the performance of popular purely empirical downscaling methods on enhancing the spatial resolution of soil moisture on the Tibetan Plateau. Although synergistic methods can improve the spatial resolution of AMSR-E soil moisture data, additional studies are needed to exclude the uncertainty from AMSR-E soil moisture estimation, the low sensitivity of the relationship model under high soil moisture, and the spatial representativeness difference between coarse pixels and point measurement.

AB  - Aims To assess 1) the effect of the combination of flooding (winter flooding vs. non-winter flooding; WFL vs NWF) and timing of straw incorporation (early vs late straw incorporation; ESI vs LSI) in the post-harvest of paddy agrosystem, on a year-round global balance of greenhouse gases (GHG) exchanges, i.e. methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O); 2) the impact on the net ecosystem carbon balance (NECB) and 3) the resulting net global warming potential (GWP). Methods A field experiment was conducted with fortnightly samplings of main GHG emissions. Effect of the studied factors on GHG emissions was seasonally assessed. The net GWP is estimated from the balance between GHG (CH4 and N2O) and NECB. Results NWF-LSI reduced net GWP by 206% compared to conventional post-harvest management (WFL-ESI). NECB was similar in all treatments. Avoiding winter flooding reduced CH4 emissions significantly in the post-harvest and next growing seasons, while delay straw incorporation prevented CH4 and CO2 emissions during post-harvest. None of the treatments increased N2O emission. Environmental implications of post-harvest management options are discussed. Conclusions Post-harvest management affects net GWP of the paddy rice cultivation by modifying GHG emissions in post-harvest and next growing season without compromise sequestration C budget. The combination of non-winter flooding and late straw incorporation strategies were more effective in reducing both CH4 and CO2 emissions, due to avoiding higher temperatures at the time of the straw incorporation during post-harvest and increasing soil Eh conditions at the following growing season.

AB  - Improving numerical weather prediction was one of the main justifications for National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) Mission. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been extensively applied to assimilate the SM observations into numerical weather predication models. Implementation of EnKF requires the observations and model simulations to be Gaussian distributed and not biased from each other. In this letter, we tested the impacts of three bias-correction methods on effectiveness of assimilating SMAP retrievals into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (GFS). They are: 1) global cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching with only one CDF for all grids and time series; 2) monthly CDF matching with one CDF for each grid; 3) the linear transformation technique that matches monthly mean and standard deviation of the SMAP retrievals and model simulations for each grid; and 4) assimilating SMAP SM data into GFS without any bias-correction procedure. With respect to the global land data assimilation (DA) system precipitation product, the results demonstrate that the effectiveness of assimilating SMAP retrievals into GFS is significantly impacted by the bias-correction methods. Relative to other DA cases, the monthly CDF matching produces the best precipitation forecast performance. Improvements of the three-hourly GFS precipitation prediction with SMAP assimilation using the monthly CDF matching can reach to 8% and 10% in sparsely and densely vegetated areas, respectively, and marginally positive in medium vegetation areas. Based on these results, assimilating SMAP retrievals into the GFS with the EnKF algorithm using the monthly CDF matching method is suggested for enhancing accuracy of the precipitation forecasts.

AB  - The influence of different in situ rainwater harvesting and moisture conservation methods on soil moisture storage and growth of Tamarix ramosissima was studied in the semiarid loess region of China from 2002 to 2004. The treatments included control (T1), trench (T2), saucer covered by plastic film (T3), bare ridge and bare furrow (T4), plastic-covered ridge and bare furrow (T5), and plastic-covered ridge and gravel-covered furrow (T6). The results indicated that soil water storage for the T5 and T6 was significantly higher than the control. The T6 treatments produced the highest amount of soil water storage, 18-137 mm more than the controls at soil depth of 0-100 cm and 40-75 rum at soil depth of 100-200 cm. No significant differences in soil water storage were found between the T2, T3, T4 and the control treatments at soil depth of 0100 cm, but soil water storage at soil depth of 100-200 cm was significantly higher for the T2, T3, T4 treatment than the control.
   Rainwater harvesting and moisture conservation treatments increased growth of T ramosissima, tree height was significantly higher for the rainwater harvesting and moisture conservation treatments than the controls. Tree height, crown diameter and collar girth for the T6 treatments increased by 70, 57 and 79% as compared to the controls. No significant differences in crown diameter and collar girth were observed between T1, T2 and T3 or T4 and T5 treatments in some years. The effectiveness of the different treatments for the tree height, crown diameter and collar girth was in the order of T6, T5, T4, T3, T2 and T1. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Electrical image data were used to estimate soil moisture content beneath smectite-dominated black Vertosol in the Liverpool Plains catchment in northern New South Wales. Measurements carried out over a range of soil moisture conditions included: water use by lucerne sown into a full pro. le, recharge of profiles after lucerne and long fallow after a cereal crop. Measurements were repeated approximately every 2 months between September 2000 and August 2001. Estimates of bulk electrical conductivity (EC), determined from inversion of apparent conductivity electrical images, were compared to soil moisture measurements made using neutron access tubes. A correlation of 0.77 (n = 228, P< 0.0001) between the 2 datasets indicates that electrical imaging can be used to satisfactorily predict bulk moisture content in soils of this type. Interpretation of the bulk EC images indicates drying of the soil profile to 6 m depth beneath lucerne.

AB  - This study aimed to assess the influences of short-term straw return combined with nitrogen (N) fertilizer on crop yield, soil properties, the bacterial community, and soil nitrogen cycling gene abundance in a rice-rapeseed planting system. A two-year field experiment was conducted in a paddy field from 2019 to 2021. There were four treatments in the experiment: -N-S, no N applied with no straw return; -N+S, no N applied with straw return; +N-S, N applied with no straw return; and +N+S, N applied with straw return. The results showed that short-term straw return combined with N fertilizer could increase crop yield and N use efficiency. N fertilizer application had a positive effect on Gemmatimonadota and Desulfobacterota abundance. Straw returning had a positive effect on Desulfobacterota and Proteobacteria abundance. N fertilization significantly increased the abundance of amoA-AOA, amoA-AOB, and nxrB in agricultural soils. Straw return and N fertilization were not conducive to denitrification. We conclude that short-term straw return combined with N fertilizer in rice-growing areas not only increase crop yield and improve crop N uptake but also increase SOM, total N, and NH4+ and improve the soil microbial activity and N use efficiency.

AB  - Land conversion critically affects soil physiochemical and biological properties, yet very little remains clear about the impact of forest conversion on the N pool and related microbial N transformations. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the dynamics of soil N availability following forest conversion into the different coffee cropping systems, and explore the mecha-nisms behind these dynamics from the microbial N transformation. Disturbed soil samples from two depths (0-20 and 20-40 cm) were collected from four land uses consisting of three different coffee cropping systems (coffee monocultures (C), coffee agroforestry (FC), coffee associated with persimmon (Diospyros kaki L.) (CH)) converted from natural forest and adjacent natural forest (F) in northern Thailand. The soil labile N pools (including ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), inor-ganic N (IN), dissolved organic N (DON) contents and microbial biomass N (MBN)) were measured, as well as the soil total N (STN) content. Soil N transformation rates, including net N mineralization, nitrification, and immobilization, were determined using a laboratory incubation experiment. The results showed that the forest conversion to coffee agroforestry significantly increased soil N content by 39.83 % in topsoil, but no significant difference was observed in C and CH soils as compared to F soil (p <= 0.05). The three labile N forms (NH4+, NO3- and DON content) were significantly higher under the C, FC and CH soils in both depths, while the coffee mono-culture decreased the MBN content. The increases in soil IN, IN/DON and NO3-/NH4+ ratios used as an N availability indicator were positively associated with an increase in the N mineralization and nitrification processes following the forest conversion. Interestingly, the N immobilization processes in the F and FC soils were significantly higher than those in the C and CH soils, which indirectly regulated a decreased nitrification rate in F and FC soils in our study. With the exception of the FC soil, the nitrification/N immobilization ratios in the C (4.95) and CH (4.08) soils were higher than those in the F (0.70) soil, indicating an increased N loss risk after forest conversion. Therefore, coffee agroforestry systems have the potential to be effective management strategies for improving soil nitrogen sequestration following forest conversion.

AB  - The nitrogen (N) dynamics of nine rotation systems designed to transition dryland cereal to organic production in eastern Washington State were examined. Systems combined cereal and legumes for grain, forage (FOR), and green manure (GRM). Few differences in N balances and soil inorganic N levels were found among transition systems when poor spring crop establishment resulted in competition from weeds. However, FOR and winter GRM crops produced adequate stands that were competitive with weeds and increased residual soil inorganic N in the final year of the transition. Winter legumes and continuous FOR systems demonstrated the greatest potential to provide a sustainable inorganic N source to subsequent organic cereal crops.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) loss with surface runoff accounts for the P input to and acceleration of eutrophication of the freshwater. Many studies have focused on factors affecting P loss with surface runoff from soils, but rarely on the relationship among these factors. In the present study, rainfall simulation on P loss with surface runoff was conducted in Huihe National Nature Reserve, in Hulunbeier grassland, China, and the relationships between P loss with surface runoff, soil properties, and rainfall conditions were examined. Principal component analysis and path analysis were used to analyze the direct and indirect effects on P loss with surface runoff. The results showed that P loss with surface runoff was closely correlated with soil electrical conductivity, soil pH, soil Olsen P, soil total nitrogen (TN), soil total phosphorus (TP), and soil organic carbon (SOC). The main driving factors which influenced P loss with surface runoff were soil TN, soil pH, soil Olsen P, and soil water content. Path analysis and determination coefficient analysis indicated that the standard multiple regression equation for P loss with surface runoff and each main factor was Y = 7.429 - 0.439 soil TN - 6.834 soil pH + 1.721 soil Olsen-P + 0.183 soil water content (r = 0.487, p < 0.01, n = 180). Soil TN, soil pH, soil Olsen P, and soil water content and the interactions between them were the main factors affecting P loss with surface runoff. The effect of physical and chemical properties of undisturbed soils on P loss with surface runoff was discussed, and the soil water content and soil Olsen P were strongly positive influences on the P loss with surface runoff.

AB  - Wise management of indigenous resources replenishes soil nutrients and improves crop productivity and soil sustainability. Three year consecutive experiments were performed in the framework of Farmers Field School (FFS) during 2012-2014. Organic nitrogen sources [animal-urine (AU), animal-manures (AM), and animal manure-compost (AMC) with two application methods [interior-application method (IAM) and exterior-application method (EAM)] and three sowing timing [early sowing (ES), late-sowing (LS), and timely sowing (TS)] were studied. One control plot in each replication was placed as a check. The results showed that among different sowing time, TS has higher grains year(-1), 1000 grains weight, dry biomass, grain yield and harvest index (HI) than LS and ES. AM delayed silking and physiological maturation. A higher grains year(-1), 1000 grains weight, grain yield, total dry biomass, and HI were observed with AMC than control plots. In application methods, the IAM has delayed the silking and physiological maturity as compared to EAM. Similarly, higher grains year(-1), 1000 grains weight, grain yield, dry biomass, and HI were observed with IAM than EAM. In sowing timing, higher grain nitrogen (GN) was observed in TS. Higher GN produced by AMC and AU treated plots. AMC produced 10% higher GN than manures treated plots. The IAM produced higher GN than EAM. The AMC produced significantly higher soil N and statistically at par with AU treated plots. IAM applied AMC, maize grain yield was higher than the AU and AM. In conclusion, AMC and AU embedded in soil with TS can sustainably increase maize yield and soil productivity.

AB  - The effects of plant growth regulators (PGRs) and potassium (K) fertilizer on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) yield have been well documented but the role of PGRs on K use efficiency is poorly understood. Our specific objective was to determine whether foliar application of PGRs could improve K use efficiency in field-grown cotton. Field experiments were conducted with or without K at two sites (Beijing and Hebei, China) varying in available soil K during 2010 and 2011, with cotton cvs. Guoxinmian3 (GX3) and SCRC28 as test materials. Foliar application of the PGRs, mepiquat chloride (MC) and Miantaijin [MTJ, a combination of MC with diethyl aminoethyl hexanoate (DA-6)] during squaring and flowering periods significantly increased the lint yield and K uptake in most situations at Beijing location and had a consistent tendency to increase lint yield across K fertilizers and years at Hebei location. The partial factor productivity (PFPK) and agronomic efficiency of K (AEK) were enhanced by the application of the PGRs in most situations in Beijing, especially in 2011 and for the cultivar GX3. Although differences in the apparent recovery efficiency of K (REK) between PGRs and control were not significant, a positive and consistent effectiveness of PGRs on REK was observed across sites, years and cultivars. Therefore, the application of PGRs would be a useful practice for improving K nutrition and lowering the cost of K fertilizer input in cotton production. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To investigate the effects of microbial inocula and Erythrina poeppigiana pruning residues on soil K, NO3-, and NH4+ concentrations, a greenhouse trial, a field experiment in an organic farm, and three in vitro tests were conducted. Under controlled conditions, weak, temporary effects (10 %) on maize seedling growth were observed on poor soils (taken from the 10-20 cm layer) in the first 2 weeks after application. Positive effects of pruning residue applications on soil K levels (0.09 cmol kg(-1), on average) were detected in both the field and greenhouse study. However, significant effects due to the addition of microbial inocula on soil K concentrations were not detected in the field; thus, microbial applications were ineffective at enhancing nutrient availability under field conditions. In contrast, in the in vitro experiments, CO2 production was 31 % greater than that of untreated soil on the 8th and 15th days of incubation. These results highlight the importance of adding tree pruning residues to support coffee-plant nutrition. Experimental outcome data could be valuable for further studies focused on microbial application dosage and timing.

AB  - Linking nutrient balances and flows to soil nutrient stocks creates a valuable indicator for sustainability assessment in agricultural land-use systems. Therefore, we investigated the impact of management on soil fertility at farm/field scale using the Nutmon approach. A detailed methodology for the adaptation of the difficult-to-quantify flows to the local conditions is described. Research was carried out in the three farming systems of Yantzaza (low-external-input), El Tambo (irrigated cash crops) and San Lucas (integrated nutrient management) in southern Ecuador. For each land-use within a farm (annual and perennial crops, pasture, forest), soil nutrient balances and flows were modeled with Nutmon and soil nutrient stocks were calculated for NPK. Soil nutrient balances were evaluated using potential socio-economic and soil fertility explanatory variables. Balances for the different land-uses in the three research areas varied between -151 to 66 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for N, -4 to 33 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for P and -346 to 39 kg ha(-1) a(-1) for K and were mainly negative. Up to 70 % of the balances' variability was explained by soil fertility variables and financial flows. Highest external inputs existed in land-uses with a strong market orientation. Land-uses benefiting from a surplus of within-farm flows had the highest soil nutrient stocks. The focus on N fertilization induced highly negative PK balances in annual crops of El Tambo. In contrast, the application of organic fertilizers and nutrient recycling in San Lucas resulted in positive NP balances particularly for perennial crops. NP balances in annual crops of Yantzaza were most negative due to nonexistent fertilization, leaching and burning of crop residues. A non-sustainable land-use of annual crops in Yantzaza was illustrated by total N stock decreases of 4.9 % a(-1) and decreased soil organic carbon stocks to 85 % of adjacent forest sites. Results indicated a potential risk regarding sustainable management of soils in the research area and provide a basis for policy and decision makers to develop appropriate management strategies.

AB  - Research is needed to develop and optimize agroecological practices that can replace unsustainable managementand increase agricultural diversification. Field experiments were conducted in Maryland and New York to assess the effect of cover crop cultivar selection and cover crop termination soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] planting (roll-plant) date on cover crop growth stage, biomass, and reseeding; weed biomass; and soybean density and yield in organically managed no-till planted soybean production. Twelve winter cereal cultivars-four each for barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), cereal rye (Secale cereale L.), and triticale (x Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.)-were seeded at equivalent densities and terminated at four roll-plant dates. Although many cover crop cultivars had not yet reached the recommended growth stage for adequate termination (anthesis) at the earlier roll-plant dates, greater soybean yields and similar cover crop reseeding, compared with later dates, were observed. Weed biomass was low across treatments despite cover crop biomass production below the recommended threshold of 8 Mg ha(-1). When pooled over cultivars, triticale performed as well as cereal rye in terms of biomass production, weed suppression, and soybean yield. Within each species, differences in weed biomass and soybean yield were observed among cultivars, but inconsistent across site-years. Results from this research also show that planting soybean before cover crop anthesis can help maximize yield. Farmers can improve management in cover crop-based no-till planted soybean by selecting regionally adapted winter cereal species and cultivars that perform well across a range of outcomes, rather than focusing exclusively on biomass production.

AB  - Understanding drought dynamics spatially and temporally is essential for environmental and socio-economic systems, especially under climate change with expected increasing drought. This study aims to update the knowledge about drought spatiotemporal changes over mainland China in the 21st century by utilizing the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) datasets. Precipitation from the nine CMIP6 models is first bias-corrected using a quantile mapping approach and then used to calculate the 3-month Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the historical period and future three scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5). We conduct a clustering algorithm to identify three-dimensional (i.e., latitude, longitude, and time) drought events to access the drought dynamics in both space and time. Results show that the drought events occur more frequently during June to September than the other months for both historical and future periods. The drought frequency is significantly increasing during Sep-Dec in the 21st century (increase by about 8.5%, p-value<0.05). Compared with the historical period, drought centers shift toward south under the future projections, indicating a relatively high drought frequency in south China. Additionally, drought events are projected to have shorter duration, smaller affected area, but higher intensity under all three scenarios. The study contributes to our comprehensive understanding of how future drought characteristics will change due to climate change from the perspective of spatiotemporal dynamics. These results are helpful to drought risk management and provide information for developing drought adaptation strategies.

AB  - Background: A two-year field study was conducted at the ICRISAT research farm during the rainy seasons of 2021 and 2022 to investigate the impact of crop geometry, crop establishment method and sustainable nutrient management practices on nutrient availability pattern and growth of hybrid pigeon pea.
   Methods: The experiment followed a split-split plot design. The collected data was analysed using radar graph and heat maps for nutrient availability and dry matter respectively.
   Result: Data revealing that transplanted plots registered higher nutrient availability and proportionate root and total dry matter production at various growth stages. Among plant geometry the root and total dry matter production was higher with 100x100 cm. when considering planting methods, transplanting with a square system of 100x100 cm, combined with an integrated nutrient management approach consisting of 150% (or) 100% soil test based NPK, vermicompost at a rate of 5 t ha(-1), phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) and seed treatment with Rhizobium, resulted in average of 31.5% higher dry matter production over alone inorganic nutrient management practices. Thus, a square geometry of 100x100 cm, along with sustainable integrated nutrient management (100% soil test based NPK, vermicompost at a rate of 5 t ha(-1), PSB and seed treatment with Rhizobium), resulted in higher nutrient availability and dry matter production. These findings highlight the importance of careful selection of planting methods, crop geometry and nutrient management practices for maximizing the nutrient mining for production of high dry matter production of hybrid pigeonpea.

AB  - No-tillage cultivation with living mulch offers several benefits related to environmental protection and fulfills requirements of sustainable agriculture very well, however there are only few reports on vegetable cultivation using this method and referring to natural conditions of Poland. In three years field experiment stake tomatoes cv. Malinowy Ozarowski grown on no-tilled plots covered with wintering hairy vetch as a living mulch produced significantly lower total and marketable yield in comparison to conventional cultivation. Yield of fruits infested with potato blight was also significantly lower but their share in total yield was much higher. Content of carotenoids, monosaccharides and total sugars in fruits harvested under conventional cultivation was significantly higher and content of dry matter was significantly lower in comparison to no-tillage and content of vitamin C was independent of cultivation method. At time of full fruiting, leaves of tomatoes grown on plots covered with mulch contained more nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium and content of calcium and magnesium did not depend of cultivation method. Method of cultivation did not affect root-taking of potted tomato transplants but then tomatoes grown on plots covered with living mulch were dominated by hairy vetch and grew much slower till third decade of July when majority of vetch plants decayed. Growth of tomatoes in vetch mulch was much more differentiated during whole vegetation period. Living and then dry vetch mulch covered soil surface almost entirely and suppressed annual weeds well. Average decade temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm depth of conventionally cultivated soil was usually higher and soil moisture in 0-40 cm layer was significantly lower than those of soil covered with mulch. Cultivation method did not affect soil total porosity nor bulk density. At time of tomato planting, fresh and air-dry weight of hairy vetch was 39.7 t.ha(-1) and 6.5 t.ha(-1) on an average respectively and it contained 180 kg N, 43 kg P, 209 kg K, 51 kg Ca and 12 kg Mg. Studied cultivation method offered several benefits related to environmental protection but was more management intensive and variable than conventional tillage.

AB  - Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yield and quality is influenced by management of the previous crop but is highly dependent on current year management. The objective of this study was to evaluate the response of winter wheat seeded in two tillage systems [conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT)] to four N rates applied to a previous cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) crop (0, 67, 134, and 202 kg ha(-1)). The experiment with wheat was conducted on a Dothan sandy loam (fine, loamy siliceous, thermic Plinthic Kandiudults) at the University of Florida North Florida Research and Education Center near Quincy, FL from 1995 to 1997. For most plant characteristics, there was a tillage x N x year interaction. Greater plant emergence (79.4 vs. 65.3%) and grain N (23.5 vs. 21.5 g kg(-1)), and lower grain moisture (139 vs. 142 g kg(-1)) were obtained under NT than CT, respectively, in one out of two ears. Nitrogen applied to a previous cotton crop increased wheat grain yields, plant height and seed number under NT in 1995-1996 and CT in 1996-1997, head density under NT in both years, harvest index under CT in 1996-1997, and grain N concentration in 19951996 and 1996-1997 due to residual plant and soil N. With every 1 kg N applied to a previous cotton crop, wheat grain yields increased by 5.38 kg ha(-1) under NT, whereas grain yield under CT was not influenced by N application to cotton in 1995-1996. In 1996-1997, grain yields increased by 4.96 and 4.23 kg ha(-1) for wheat grown in NT and CT, respectively. Generally, wheat seeded in NT following cotton did not decrease stand or yields compared to CT and wheat grain yields and grain N content increased with N fertilization of the previous crop. However, we would have to apply about 134 kg N ha(-1) to a previous cotton crop to maximize wheat production under NT and CT. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper aims to investigate several new nonlinear/non-Gaussian filters in the context of the sequential data assimilation. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF), the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the sampling importance resampling particle filter (SIR-PF) and the unscented particle filter (UPF) are described in the state-space model framework in the Bayesian filtering background. We first evaluated those methods with a simple highly nonlinear Lorenz model and a scalar nonlinear non-Gaussian model to investigate the filter stability and the error sensitivity, and then their abilities in the one-dimensional estimation of the soil moisture content with the synthetic microwave brightness temperature assimilation experiment in the land surface model VIC-3L. All the results are compared with the EnKF. The advantages and disadvantages of each filter are discussed.
   The results in the Lorenz model showed that the particle filters are suitable for the large measurement interval assimilation and that the Kalman filters were suitable for the frequent measurement assimilation as well as small measurement uncertainties. The EnKF also showed its feasibility for the non-Gaussian noise. The performance of the SIR-PF was actually not as good as that of the UKF or the EnKF regarding a very small observation noise level compared with the uncertainties in the system. In the one-dimensional brightness temperature assimilation experiment, the UKF, the EnKF and the SIR-PF all proved to be flexible and reliable nonlinear filter algorithms for the low dimensional sequential land data assimilation application. For the high dimensional land surface system that takes the horizontal error correlations into account, the UKF is restricted by its computational demand in the covariance propagation; we must use the EnKF, the SIR-PF and other covariance reduction algorithms. The large computational cost prevents the UPF from being applied in practice. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - The performance of very shallow geothermal systems (VSGs), interesting the first 2 m of depth from ground level, is strongly correlated to the kind of sediment locally available. These systems are attractive due to their low installation costs, less legal constraints, easy maintenance and possibility for technical improvements. The Improving Thermal Efficiency of horizontal ground heat exchangers Project (ITER) aims to understand how to enhance the heat transfer of the sediments surrounding the pipes and to depict the VSGs behavior in extreme thermal situations. In this regard, five helices were installed horizontally surrounded by five different backfilling materials under the same climatic conditions and tested under different operation modes. The field test monitoring concerned: (a) monthly measurement of thermal conductivity and moisture content on surface; (b) continuous recording of air and ground temperature (inside and outside each helix); (c) continuous climatological and ground volumetric water content (VWC) data acquisition. The interactions between soils, VSGs, environment and climate are presented here, focusing on the differences and similarities between the behavior of the helix and surrounding material, especially when the heat pump is running in heating mode for a very long time, forcing the ground temperature to drop below 0 degrees C.

AB  - Extensive irrigation strategies are commonly and widely used for orchards in Northern China, leading to low water-use efficiency (WUE) and potential fertilizer pollution of underground water. Effective micro-irrigation strategies for orchards remain unclear and require further investigation to assist in developing orchard water saving irrigation systems. In this study, compared with local traditional furrow irrigation, six micro-irrigation strategies (with or without mulch film) were applied to a 6-year-old cherry (Prunus avium L.) field for three years (2015-2017). The moisture spatial distribution of soil profile, water consumption, yield, and fruit quality were measured to evaluate the effectiveness of different irrigation strategies on growth and WUE of cherry trees. The results showed that the strongest variability of moisture in soil profile was in the 0-60 cm soil layer, indicating the water uptake of cherry trees is closely related to the soil moisture content in this region. Compared with furrow irrigation, micro-irrigation strategies can significantly (P < 0.05) reduce the water consumption of cherry trees without reducing yield, and treatments with mulch film will further enhance this effect. Ring drip irrigation with mulch film and parallel drip irrigation with mulch film significantly (P < 0.05) improved WUE. Furthermore, parallel drip irrigation with mulch film at a designed wetting depth of 60 cm was suggested irrigation strategy for a 6-year-old cherry field in terms of WUE, yield, fruit quality, and maintenance cost, The findings of this study provide a typical reference for further research on water-saving irrigation systems of perennial fruit trees.

AB  - Most previous land-surface model calibration studies have defined global ranges for their parameters to search for optimal parameter sets. Little work has been conducted to study the impacts of realistic versus global ranges as well as model complexities on the calibration and uncertainty estimates. The primary purpose of this paper is to investigate these impacts by employing Bayesian Stochastic Inversion (BSI) to the Chameleon Surface Model (CHASM). The CHASM was designed to explore the general aspects of land-surface energy balance representation within a common modeling framework that can be run from a simple energy balance formulation to a complex mosaic type structure. The BSI is an uncertainty estimation technique based on Bayes theorem, importance sampling, and very fast simulated annealing. The model forcing data and surface flux data were collected at seven sites representing a wide range of climate and vegetation conditions. For each site, four experiments were performed with simple and complex CHASM formulations as well as realistic and global parameter ranges. Twenty eight experiments were conducted and 50 000 parameter sets were used for each run. The results show that the use of global and realistic ranges gives similar simulations for both modes for most sites, but the global ranges tend to produce some unreasonable optimal parameter values. Comparison of simple and complex modes shows that the simple mode has more parameters with unreasonable optimal values. Use of parameter ranges and model complexities have significant impacts on frequency distribution of parameters, marginal posterior probability density functions, and estimates of uncertainty of simulated sensible and latent heat fluxes. Comparison between model complexity and parameter ranges shows that the former has more significant impacts on parameter and uncertainty estimations.

AB  - The application of geophysical detection techniques to mapping the underground of agricultural and forest fields has accelerated in recent years. Geophysical imaging provides an alternative or complement to traditional methods of collecting subsurface variables over time and space. Where previously the standard was soil sampling and laboratory analysis to assess the condition of a soil for its various purposes, in situ detection techniques are proving to be a very effective way to assess variation in soil / underground properties. This work is a review of the state of the art related to the most applied geophysical techniques in the detection of underground components and processes that can influence the productivity and functioning of forest ecosystems and agricultural systems. This review highlights the opportunities, applications and challenges presented by geophysical images (radargrams and tomograms) in the multidisciplinary fields of Biogeosciences. Both geophysical research techniques are very attractive to the scientific community, allowing the underground to be accurately mapped, plot rooting, monitor water content, identify sales movement and agrochemicals. Agronomists, foresters, and the scientific community would benefit from adopting these minimally invasive, scalable imaging technologies to the underground and advance our collective research.

AB  - Winter annual legume cover crops often fail to reach full maturity by spring vegetable planting dates in northern climates, which prevents maximum nitrogen (N) contributions. To determine if delayed termination improved cover crop biomass and N content, we evaluated winter rye + hairy vetch (Secale cereale L. + Vicia villosa Roth) and oat + field pea (Avena sativa L. + Pisum sativum L.) cover crop mixtures in 2015 and 2016, and medium red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) in 2016, in zone-tilled organic yellow crookneck squash (Cucurbita pepo var. torticollis Harz). In-row regions where cover crops were terminated in early spring during crop row preparation were compared to between-row regions where termination was delayed until legume maturation in late spring. Soil quality (soil inorganic N, permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), and potentially mineralizable N (PMN)) was also determined for in-row and between-row regions at four time points throughout the growing season. In 2015, winter rye + hairy vetch biomass N more than doubled between early and late termination times, with 120 and 258 kg N ha(-1), respectively. Permanganate oxidizable C was not responsive to cover crop systems or tillage, and only slightly decreased over time in 2016. Soil inorganic N and PMN after cover crop termination in 2016 provided evidence of localized soil N cycling responses to cover crop termination in in-row and between-row regions. The extended growing period for cover crops between crop rows in the first several weeks of crop growth had no negative effect on crop yield, and appeared to enhance soil fertility.

AB  - Evidence from farm level studies indicates that there is potential to improve nitrogen (N) fertilizer efficiency of Australian dairy farms. Increasing N fertilizer application rates to drive pasture dry matter production beyond an agronomic or economical optimum has the potential to result in detrimental environmental outcomes. Our study, using the biophysical whole-farm systems model DairyMod, modelled a range of N fertilizer rates on total N loss for five dairy sites through south-eastern Australia, using 18 years of historical climate. Nitrogen accumulation in plant biomass and soil N accumulation within and below the rootzone were estimated. Total N loss, in the form of volatilization, leaching, runoff and denitrification lost to the environment were also estimated. The reduction in N fertilizer inputs required to achieve 90% of relative yield (Y90), relative to maximum pasture production (Ymax), was > 50% across all sites and seasons. The associated reduction in total N loss when fertilizer was reduced from Ymax to Y90, varied between 34% and 74%, depending on site and season. Nitrogen recovery (proportion of N recovered in biomass relative to N fertilizer applied) exceeded 100% with lower N fertilizer rates (< 30 kg N ha(-1) month(-1)) for most sites and seasons. Demand for N was high during spring due to high pasture growth and this was supported via N mineralization and legacy N build-up in winter. Nitrate leaching risk was highest in winter for the four temperate sites and autumn at the subtropical site. This study demonstrated the benefits of developing site and seasonal-specific N fertilizer best management practice guidelines that are both economical and environmentally beneficial. When considering whether to add more fertilizer, the value of additional pasture production needs to be weighed up against environmental N losses and the cost of additional N fertilizer to achieve this. The relationship between seasonal soil and climatic conditions and N loss and recovery were also examined for one rainfed site. As this study does not consider the externalities associated with N loss, recommendations need to be considered and amended in the context of location specificity and seasonal climatic conditions.

AB  - Approximately 70% of global cotton production is under the threat of drought. Changing cropping systems is an agronomic measure that potentially coordinates production and ecology. However, little evidence is available on the characteristics of changes in the soil moisture under different cropping systems and their relationships with cotton production. This study assessed the temporal and spatial variation in the soil moisture and analyzed the relationships between the soil water content (SWC) and the biomass, yield, and water use efficiency (WUE) of cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in three cropping systems (monoculture cotton (MC), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/ delayed intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded cotton (WDC)). The spatiotemporal heterogeneity and autocorrelation of the soil moisture were affected by cropping systems and whether the soil was dry or wet. Compared with the values in 2016 (moist), the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in the SWC variation at a 10???110 cm depth in the three planting systems increased, and the autocorrelation decreased in 2017 (drought). This phenomenon was more pronounced in WIC than in MC and WDC. Compared with MC, the double-cropping system increased the SWC between cotton rows. In the double-cropping system, the cotton yield of WIC was significantly higher than that of WDC. The order of WUE from high to low was WDC>MC>WIC in 2016 and MC>WIC>WDC in 2017, and no significant difference was observed between MC and WIC in both years. Yield limitation in the double-cropping system was due to weak water absorption of roots. The growth curves of cotton roots with increasing SWC in WIC were similar to those in MC, while WDC showed faster root growth but a smaller maximum value. The roots in WDC stopped growing when the water consumption reached 150 mm. WDC with a small root system was suitable for humid regions, while WIC with a strong root system should be promoted in both humid and arid regions. The methods and results can be used to obtain a deeper understanding of the effects of different planting systems on soil moisture and cotton production and to determine their interrelationship to guide dryland cotton production and precision agriculture.

We present a nearly continuous 6-year record of fine-root production and mortality from minirhizotron analysis of a closed-canopy, deciduous sweetgum forest in a free-air CO2 enrichment experiment. Annual production of fine roots was more than doubled in plots with 550 ppm CO2 compared with plots in ambient air. This response was the primary component of the sustained 22% increase in net primary productivity. Annual fine-root mortality matched annual production, and the mean residence time of roots was not altered by elevated CO2, but peak fine-root standing crop in midsummer was significantly higher in CO2-enriched plots, especially deeper in the soil profile. The preferential allocation of additional carbon to fine roots, which have a fast turnover rate in this species, rather than to stemwood reduces the possibility of long-term enhancement by elevated CO2 of carbon sequestration in biomass. However, sequestration of some of the fine-root carbon in soil pools is not precluded, and there may be other benefits to the tree from a seasonally larger and deeper fine-root system. Root-system dynamics can explain differences among ecosystems in their response to elevated atmospheric CO2; hence, accurate assessments of carbon flux and storage in forests in a globally changing atmosphere must account for this unseen and difficult-to-measure component.

AB  - Characteristics of moisture transport associated with a monsoon depression (MD) formed over the Bay of Bengal and later moved westward over central India are presented. The investigation is carried out mainly using the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) cloud-resolving model simulations and the vertically integrated water vapor transport (IVT) to assess the path and features of the moisture transport. The model performance evalu-ation is carried out using micrometeorological and microwave radiometer observations from the Cloud Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX). The results indicate that the strengthened LLJ during the nocturnal periods helps to enhance the moisture convergence in the lower troposphere and thus the rainfall, both before the formation of MD as well as during its passage over land. The moisture budget over a selected region along the path of the MD gave further insights on the moisture convergence, associated pre-cipitation and related features during the study period. The analyses using IVT and LLJ strength are illustrated to be useful in identifying areas of intense convection.

AB  - On sandy paddy fields, key factors for successful crops in the dry season without irrigation are a shallow water table and practices such as deep seed-placement but only some legume species are adapted to such conditions. To understand the adaptation of legume species to deep seed-placement over shallow water tables, we studied their rooting patterns on two sandy soils. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), mungbean (Vigna radiata), peanut (Arachis hypogaea) and soybean (Glycine max) seeds were sown shallow (similar to 5 cm) or deep (similar to 15 cm) in deep sandy soils after harvesting rice in two shallow water table locations in north-east Thailand. The legumes depended mainly on capillary water rising from the water table and none experienced water deficit throughout the growing season. Generally, deeper seed-placement decreased overall root dry weight, but it increased the root surface area to weight ratio. Deep seed-placement promoted a greater fraction of root growth into the subsoil for cowpea (86-99% of total root length), mungbean (61-93% of total root length) and peanut (78-98% of total root length) where the soil contained more water throughout the growing season. Moreover, deep seed-placement at the site with the lower water table promoted deeper penetration of roots of cowpea (similar to 20 cm deeper), mungbean (similar to 20-40 cm deeper) and peanut (similar to 20-40 cm deeper) which improved water access, especially late during the growing season when topsoils dried to close to wilting point. Unlike other species, the soybean rooting pattern did not respond much to seed-placement depths, or soil moisture.

AB  - Maize is an important crop in the high and medium rainfall areas of Kenya and thus, there is a need for additional information on the effect of tillage and soil management practices on water conservation and yield of maize. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of seven soil management practices: bare with conventional tillage (BC), bare with minimum tillage (BM), incorporated mulch with conventional tillage (IMuC), manure with conventional tillage (MaC), manure with minimum tillage (MaM), surface mulch with conventional tillage (SMuC), and surface mulch with minimum tillage (SMuM) on water conservation and yield of maize.
   Soil water content was greater in minimum tilled plots than in the conventionally tilled (hand hoeing) plots during the study period. This was demonstrated by the manure with minimum tilled treatment, which had the highest soil moisture (7.6% and 9.3%) both at 0-7 cm and 7-23 cm depth. However, when organic matter additions were analyzed separately, it was observed that manure irrespective of tillage had the highest soil moisture in both depths (7.6% and 8.1%). The differences within the treatments occurred when soil water contents were highest shortly after the rains.
   When the amount of soil water for each management practice was averaged for all the seasons, a significant difference was found at P = 0.0001. Manure (Ma) and surface mulched (Smu) treatments had significantly higher soil moisture content than the other treatments. The higher moisture content found under these treatments was attributed to higher infiltration rates, better cover that reduced the rainfall kinetic energy, and to better structural stability contributed to by higher organic carbon.
   Compared with the traditional form of hand hoeing, minimum tillage increased available soil water content drastically and crop performance was improved. Grain yields were greatest in manure and lowest in bare treatments. There were significant differences in grain yield in all treatments.

AB  - A summertime convective event that developed on 5 September 2017 over the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is investigated in this study. Atmospheric profiles from a ground-based microwave radiometer along with satellite observations and in situ data from three weather stations in the UAE were used. The event was simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, forced with four input datasets: Global Forecast System (GFS), Climate Forecast System Reanalysis (CFSR), and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-5 and ERA-Interim reanalyses. The afternoon and evening convection was triggered by the intrusion of a mid-level trough from midlatitudes and was favoured by the convergence over land of thermally forced maritime air masses. Near-surface observations at a weather station revealed a 7 degrees C drop in air temperature, a doubling of the wind speed to 9 m center dot s(-1) in 30 min, and a shift in wind direction from easterly, to southerly and then westerly in about 45 min, associated with the passage of the cold pool emanating from a Mesoscale Convective System (MCS). At the location where the microwave radiometer was deployed, the pre-squall low and wake low signatures are also captured, with a 5 m center dot s(-1) increase in the wind speed in just 5 min. The observed features of the studied MCS were found to compare with those reported for MCSs in the Tropics. The four experiments gave a similar performance, although the GFS simulation generally generated higher skill scores. The investigated MCS event was not captured by WRF, which was attributed to a misrepresentation of soil moisture in the model. This study highlights the difficulties regional models like WRF may have in reproducing MCSs over arid/hyperarid regions, which may result in a misrepresentation of their impacts in climate projection studies.

AB  - Flood-susceptibility mapping is an important component of flood risk management to control the effects of natural hazards and prevention of injury. We used a remote-sensing and geographic information system (GIS) platform and a machine-learning model to develop a flood susceptibility map of Kangsabati River Basin, India where flash flood is common due to monsoon precipitation with short duration and high intensity. And in this subtropical region, climate change's impact helps to influence the distribution of rainfall and temperature variation. We tested three models-particle swarm optimization (PSO), an artificial neural network (ANN), and a deep-leaning neural network (DLNN)-and prepared a final flood susceptibility map to classify flood-prone regions in the study area. Environmental, topographical, hydrological, and geological conditions were included in the models, and the final model was selected based on the relations between potentiality of causative factors and flood risk based on multi-collinearity analysis. The model results were validated and evaluated using the area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), which is an indicator of the current state of the environment and a value >0.95 implies a greater risk of flash floods. The AUC values for ANN, DLNN, and PSO for training datasets were 0.914, 0.920, and 0.942, respectively. Among these three models, PSO showed the best performance with an AUC value of 0.942. The PSO approach is applicable for flood susceptibility mapping of the eastern part of India, a subtropical region, to allow flood mitigation and help to improve risk management in this region.

AB  - Water erosion is one of the problems in the country that reduces soil fertility, environmental degradation, food security threats, and the filling of dams' reservoirs. Therefore, the use of sedimentation control methods such as Gabion structures is considered important. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the geotechnical structures of Kowsar watershed in the Khuzestan province with an area of 64.81 km(2), located in the longitude 48 degrees 25 ' 36 '' to 48 degrees 33 ' 27 '' east, and the latitudes 32 degrees 40 ' 54 '' to 32 degrees 45 ' 38 '' north. In this basin, 279 structures with a volume of 13,374.35 m(3) were studied in 2017. The results of this study showed that the specific erosion and sediment production in this basin were 5742 m(3) km(-2) and 145,130 m(3) year(-1). Based on the area of each of the sub-basin and based on PSIAC factors, it was found that 76.12% of the basin area was in the very erosive class, 0.3% in the erosion class and 23.58% in the moderate erosion class. In general, it was expected that 13,442.99 m(3) of sediment would be inhibited in this sub-basin, but due to the destruction of some structures, the trapped sediment rate was determined to be 79,421.8 m(3). Therefore, the structures constructed in the Kowsar basin with an efficiency of 59% had a relatively good ability to contain sediments in this basin.

AB  - Efficient nitrogen (N) management is required for sustaining crop yield and minimizing environmental impacts. The aims of this study were to evaluate the effects of winter cover crops and their residue management on N-uptake, N use efficiency (NUE) and yield of the following eggplant (Solanum melanogena L.) crop. Two 2-year field experiments (2009/2010 and 2010/2011 growing seasons) were carried out in a Mediterranean environment of Central Italy in a Typic Xerofluvent soil. The treatments consisted in: (a) three winter cover crops [hairy vetch (Vicia villosa Roth.), oat (Avena sativa L.), and oilseed rape (Brassica napus L)] and one bare soil; (b) three cover crop residue managements [residues left in strips on soil surface (RS); residues incorporated into the soil at a depth of 10 cm in minimum tillage (MT) and residues incorporated into the soil at a depth of 30 cm in conventional tillage (CT)]. The cover crop biomass characteristics, soil mineral N, SPAD readings, crop yield and N-uptake of eggplant were determined. At cover crop termination, hairy vetch showed the highest aboveground biomass and nitrogen content (6.18 Mg ha(-1) of DM and 3.1%, respectively) and the lowest value of C/N ratio (12.7). The mineralization rate of cover crop aboveground biomass was higher in hairy vetch (72%), intermediate in oilseed rape (63%) and lower in oat residues (49%), while it was slower in RS compared to MT and CT among the residue managements. Yield, fruit and straw N-uptake of eggplant were high following hairy vetch (35.2 Mg ha(-1) of FM, 93.9 kg N ha(-1) and 78.3 kg N ha(-1), respectively) and low following oat (13.2 Mg ha(-1) of FM, 29.1 kg N ha(-1) and 33.6 kg N ha(-1), respectively). Similarly NUE was high in hairy vetch, followed by oilseed rape and oat (48.6, 19.4, -30.8%, respectively), even if RS residue management in hairy vetch and oat and MT residue management in oilseed rape proved to be more effective for improving the eggplant yield and nitrogen utilization efficiency. The amount of residual N left in the soil, following eggplant cultivation, was higher in the hairy vetch than in oat and oilseed rape treatments. Cover crop species and their residue management strongly influenced NUE and yield of eggplant. No-tillage strategy is preferable with legume cover crop residues in order to reduce the risks of N loss. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In Australia, most wheat is sown in a no-till system without prior cultivation where herbicides are applied prior to sowing and incorporated by the planter. Trifluralin has been the most widely used PRE herbicide to control rigid ryegrass. The objective of this research was to determine crop safety and efficacy of alternative mechanism of action PRE herbicides for rigid ryegrass control in no-till wheat production. Pyroxasulfone achieved 98% control with PRE applications. The alternative PRE herbicides tested alone and in mixtures occasionally resulted in a significant reduction in wheat emergence but not crop yield. Trifluralin treatments failed at sites having trifluralin-resistant rigid ryegrass. Pyroxasulfone and prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor were effective for control of rigid ryegrass across all trials with control ranging from 64 to 94%. This research demonstrated that PRE applications of herbicides other than trifluralin such as pyroxasulfone and prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor can be safely and effectively used to control rigid ryegrass in no-till wheat.

AB  - Rice alternated with upland crops has become increasingly popular in recent years. To investigate the residual effects of nitrogen from the previous upland crop on rice growth, two cropping systems, garlic-rice and wheat-rice, were studied from 2014 to 2017 under field conditions and from 2016 to 2017 under pot conditions. The results showed that the total nitrogen content in the 0-0.2 m soil was higher for the garlic-rice cropping system than for the wheat-rice cropping system and the N-15 isotope abundance of the soil after harvesting garlic was 63% higher than that after harvesting wheat. Residual nitrogen from the preceding crops was one of the main nitrogen sources for rice growth. The contribution of residual nitrogen accounted for 17% to 60% of the total nitrogen accumulation by rice plants during the vegetative stage, which gradually decreased after the rice jointing stage. Most of the residual nitrogen absorbed by rice plants was transported to the reproductive organs for grain growth. Therefore, the growth of vegetative organs, viz., tillers and leaves, was more vigorous under the garlic-rice cropping system than under the wheat-rice cropping system. This led to a significant increase in total nitrogen accumulation in rice plants and an increase in rice yield by 8% to 16%, even under identical management of rice under upland crop-paddy rice systems. Thus, under upland crop-paddy rice systems, high-yield and high-efficiency rice production can be achieved by utilizing residual nitrogen from the preceding crops and decreasing the application of base and tiller nitrogen.

AB  - Pratylenchus thornei is a major pathogen of wheat crops in the northern grain region of Eastern Australia with an estimated annual yield loss of $38 million. Damaged crops show symptoms of water and nutrient stress that suggest uptake is significantly affected. In order to understand the mechanisms involved in reducing water uptake and consequently plant yield, detailed measurements of water extraction and leaf area were conducted on a range of wheat cultivars with differing levels of tolerance and resistance to P. thornei.
   Planting wheat into high populations of P. thomei reduced the extraction rate (kl) in the intolerant cultivars; this in turn caused a delay in the root extraction velocity and effectively changed the crop lower limit. The early season stress applied by the reduced extraction rate impeded canopy development that consequently reduced demand for water and nutrients, growth and yield potential. The resulting yield loss was consistent across both a wet and a dry wheat growing season with the intolerant cultivar yielding 34% less than the tolerant cultivar. Understanding the mechanism with which P. thomei reduces yield allows the impact of P. thornei to be included in simulation models to better understand how to manage this constraint to the Australian grain industry.

AB  - Riparian zones are deemed significant due to their interception capability of non-point Source impacts and the maintenance of ecosystem integrity region wide. To improve classification and change detection of riparian buffers, this paper developed an evolutionary computational, supervised classification method - the Riparian Classification Algorithm (RICAL) - to conduct the seasonal change detection of riparian zones in a vast semi-arid watershed, South Texas. RICAL uniquely demonstrates an integrative effort to incorporate both vegetation indices and soil moisture images derived from LANDSAT 5 TM and RADARSAT-1 satellite images, respectively. First, an estimation of soil moisture based on RADARSAT-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images was conducted via the first-stage genetic programming (GP) practice. Second, for the statistical analyses and image classification, eight vegetation indices were prepared based on reflectance factors that were calculated as the response of the instrument on LANDSAT. These spectral vegetation indices were then independently used for discriminate analysis along With Soil moisture images to classify the riparian zones via the second-stage GP practice. The practical implementation was assessed by a case study in the Choice Canyon Reservoir Watershed (CCRW), South Texas, which is mostly agricultural and range land in a semi-arid coastal environment. To enhance the application potential, a combination of Iterative Self-Organizing Data Analysis Techniques (ISODATA) and maximum likelihood supervised classification was also performed for spectral discrimination and classification of riparian varieties comparatively. Research findings show that the RICAL algorithm may yield around 90% accuracy based on the unseen ground data. But using different vegetation indices Would not significantly improve the final quality of the spectral discrimination and classification. Such practices may lead to the formulation of more effective management strategies for the handling of non-point source Pollution, bird habitat monitoring, and grazing and live stock management in the future.

AB  - Studies suggest that coincidental adoption of both herbicide-resistant genetically modified crops (GMC) and conservation management may be mutually complementary, but integrated conservation systems with GMCs need to be assessed to balance production goals with environmental concerns. Genetically modified glyphosate-resistant cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) was managed on replicated experimental plots as either no-till (NT) or minimum tillage (MT) and with either no cover (NC) or rye (Secale cereal L.) cover crop (CC) from 2001 to 2007 near Stoneville, MS. Rainfall simulations in 2007 were used to evaluate water quality in runoff as influenced by management at two critical times: (i) 24 h after fertilizer application in the spring; and (ii) 24 h after tillage following crop harvest. With the exception of MT-NC in the spring (with the lowest surface plant residue coverage, 2%), runoff was higher in fall than spring. Suspended solids and turbidity in runoff were higher for tilled soil (MT) and areas with no cover crop, particularly in the fall. Tillage in the fall was the largest contributor to erosion loss. Similarly, total orthophosphate and total Kjeldahl N losses were greatest with tillage in the fall, while the lowest dissolved organic C losses in runoff were in fall with NT. Overall, NT and CC treatments reduced nutrient and solids losses. Major factors contributing to these results include recent tillage (in the fall) and coverage of the soil surface by plant residues (NT > MT, CC > NC). This study demonstrated the effectiveness of integrating cover crop and conservation tillage in reducing runoff and nutrient losses in a GMC system.

AB  - To improve productivity, reduce production costs, and minimize the environmental impacts of agriculture, the advancement of nitrogen (N) fertilizer management methods is needed. The objective of this study is to compare the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) multispectral imagery and PlanetScope satellite imagery, together with plant height, leaf area index (LAI), soil moisture, and field topographic metrics to predict the canopy nitrogen weight (g/m2) of wheat fields in southwestern Ontario, Canada. Random Forests (RF) and support vector regression (SVR) models, applied to either UAV imagery or satellite imagery, were evaluated for canopy nitrogen weight prediction. The top-performing UAV imagery-based validation model used SVR with seven selected variables (plant height, LAI, four VIs, and the NIR band) with an R2 of 0.80 and an RMSE of 2.62 g/m2. The best satellite imagery-based validation model was RF, which used 17 variables including plant height, LAI, the four PlanetScope bands, and 11 VIs, resulting in an R2 of 0.92 and an RMSE of 1.75 g/m2. The model information can be used to improve field nitrogen predictions for the effective management of N fertilizer.

AB  - Shelterbelt systems play pivotal roles in providing goods and services to the rural community and the society at large, but phosphorus (P) cycling in shelterbelt systems is poorly studied, while P cycling and availability would be linked to the ecological function and services of shelterbelt systems. This study was conducted to understand how long-term (>30 years) land-use between cropland and forestland in shelterbelt systems affect soil P status. We investigated modified Kelowna (P-Kelowna) and Mehlich-3 (P-Mehlich) extractable P, P fractions (by sequential chemical fractionation), P sorption properties in the 0-10 and 10-30 cm soils and their relationship in six pairs of the cropland areas and adjacent forestland (each pair constitutes a shelterbelt system) in central Alberta. Both P-Kelowna and P-Mehlich in the 0-10 cm soil were greater in the cropland than in the forestland. The P-Kelowna ranged from 10 to 170 and 2 to 57 mg kg(-1) within the cropland areas and forestland, respectively. The inorganic P fraction in the 0-30 cm depth was significantly related to P-Kelowna (R-2 = 0.55) and P-Mehlich (R-2 = 0.80) in cropland, but organic P fraction was not significantly related with neither P-Kelowna nor P-Mehlich. The iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) associated P (Fe/Al-P) explained similar to 50% and similar to 45% of the variation of P-Kelowna in the 0-30 cm soil in the cropland and forestland, respectively. The Fe/Al-P and organic P fractions in the 0-10 cm soil were greater in the cropland than in the forestland. The differences in availability and P forms depending on the land use type in shelterbelts suggest that P management needs to be land-use type-specific for shelterbelt systems.

AB  - This paper presents dielectric measurements of talc, glass beads, and their mixtures under different moisture and salinity levels. The measurements were conducted using a prototype seven-rod probe (15 mm long central rod) connected to a single port of vector network analyzer. The samples were moistened with distilled water and KCl solutions in order to obtain six different moisture content levels. The complex dielectric permittivity was determined from vector network analyzer reflection-coefficient measurements based on the open-water-liquid calibration procedure. Next, the fitting of volumetric water content-real part of dielectric permittivity calibration curves was performed for each material at selected frequencies, and the obtained relations were compared with well-known calibration equations. Additionally, a salinity index for the tested materials was calculated. It was concluded that pure talc is not an optimal material for the calibration and verification of dielectric methods. The calibration curves obtained for glass beads and the mixtures of glass beads with talc gave results close to well-known reference calibration functions. Additionally, the addition of talc caused the data points to be less scattered. Moreover, the values of the salinity index for the tested materials were in a good agreement with literature data for sand. The obtained results indicated that glass beads with the addition of talc can be used as a reference material for the calibration and verification of dielectric methods and devices for soil moisture measurement.

AB  - Quantitative information on cropland phosphorus (P) flows at the township scale is critical for developing sustainable P management measures under the smallholder farming system. This study addressed changes in cropland soil surface P budgets (i.e., net of P inputs and crop outputs), use efficiencies (i.e., the ratio between crop P uptake and total P input) and legacy P pools across 21 townships in the Yongan watershed of eastern China in 1980-2010. For the entire watershed, total P input (>98% from synthetic fertilizer and farmyard manure), crop uptake and budgets per cropland area increased from 50.4, 17.3 and 33.1 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1980 to 74.6, 20.5 and 55.1 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) in 1995, and then sharply declined to 39.6, 11.4 and 28.2 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2010, respectively. Estimated P use efficiency decreased from 34% in 1980 to 26% in 1999 before slightly increasing to 28% in 2010. Although the 21 townships had similar temporal variations over the 1980-2010 period, P budgets and use efficiency showed 2-3-fold spatial variability among townships within a given year. Spatio-temporal variations in the P budget and use efficiency were mainly related to changes in P fertilization rates and patterns (i.e., ratio of applied synthetic fertilizer P and farmyard manure P) and cropland types. The 20 townships having soil data had 87-720% and 113-395% increases of Olsen-P and total P contents in the upper 20 cm of cropland soils between 1984 and 2009, respectively. Increased soil TP level between 1984 and 2009 suggested that more than 53-79% of the cumulative P budget accumulated as legacy P pools in cropland soils. Based on regression analyses, legacy soil P contribution to annual crop P uptake was estimated to increase from 0.47 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) (3%) in 1980 to 3.45 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) (31%) in 2010, with 52-80% from synthetic fertilizer and 2-46% from farmyard manure. Improved utilization of soil legacy P pools for crop production and increasing P use efficiency are necessary to minimize P inputs and reduce nonpoint source P pollution load. The high spatial heterogeneity in P budgets and use efficiencies across townships, as well as considerable legacy soil P pools after long-term over-application, should be considered in developing P management strategies under smallholder farm systems.

AB  - Increases in P fertiliser use in Australian grain production systems over the past decades have not necessarily coincided with improved nutrient-use efficiency by crops because only a small proportion of applied P has been directly used by crops, leaving large amounts of the P in soil. Information on the transformation of applied P and the residual effectiveness of P fertiliser in growers' paddocks under their crop rotations in a wide range of soil types may help to develop improved management practises for P fertilisers. The present study examined the size and changes of P pools in soils in the major regions used for grain production across northern Victoria. Soil samples were collected from 43 sites representing all the major soil types. In addition, samples were collected from adjacent 'reference' areas across fence-lines where remnant native vegetation was present to examine long-term changes in soil fertility as a result of cropping. Highly positive P balance in 27 growers' paddocks indicates potentially high rates of P fertilization in excess of that exported/lost from these paddocks. The accumulated P was transformed into both labile and non-labile pools depending on the general chemical-physical properties of a particular soil. In particular, in soils with a sandy texture and low oxalate-extractable Al and Fe such as the sandy Calcarosols, the residual P fertilizer was preferentially transformed into labile and moderately labile pools. These P fractions can be available for subsequent crops. In contrast, a large proportion of P fertilizer applied to other soil types has been transformed into the non-labile P pools where crops have difficulty in accessing. It is suggested that P application rates should be reduced to avoid the loss of P through sorption/precipitation, leaching or run-off while still meet crop demand.

AB  - Agricultural production is highly dependent on the weather. The mechanisms of action are complex and interwoven, making it difficult to identify relevant management and adaptation options. The present study uses random forests to investigate such highly non-linear systems for predicting yield anomalies in winter wheat at district levels in Germany. In order to take into account sub-seasonality, monthly features are used that explicitly take soil moisture into account in addition to extreme meteorological events. Clustering is used to show spatially different damage potentials, such as a higher susceptibility to drought damage from May to July in eastern Germany compared to the rest of the country. In addition, relevant heat effects are not detected if the clusters are not sufficiently defined. The variable with the highest importance is soil moisture in March, where higher soil moisture has a detrimental effect on crop yields. In general, soil moisture explains more yield variations than the meteorological variables. The approach has proven to be suitable for explaining historical extreme yield anomalies for years with exceptionally high losses (2003, 2018) and gains (2014) and the spatial distribution of these anomalies. The highest test R-squared (R-2) is about 0.68. Furthermore, the sensitivity of yield variations to soil moisture and extreme meteorological conditions, as shown by the visualization of average marginal effects, contributes to the promotion of targeted decision support systems.

AB  - No-till cropping can increase soil C stocks and aggregation but patterns of long-term changes in N2O emissions, soil N availability, and crop yields still need to be resolved. We measured soil C accumulation, aggregation, soil water, N2O emissions, soil inorganic N, and crop yields in till and no-till corn-soybean-wheat rotations between 1989 and 2002 in southwestern Michigan and investigated whether tillage effects varied over time or by crop. Mean annual NO3 concentrations in no-till were significantly less than in conventional till in three of six corn years and during one year of wheat production. Yields were similar in each system for all 14 years but three, during which yields were higher in no-till, indicating that lower soil NO3 concentrations did not result in lower yields. Carbon accumulated in no-till soils at a rate of 26 g C m(-2) yr(-1) over 12 years at the 0- to 5-cm soil depth. Average nitrous oxide emissions were similar in till (3.27 +/- 0.52 g N ha d(-1)) and no-till (3.63 +/- 0.53 g N ha d(-1)) systems and were sufficient to offset 56 to 61% of the reduction in CO2 equivalents associated with no-till C sequestration. After controlling for rotation and environmental effects by normalizing treatment differences between till and no-till systems we found no significant trends in soil N, N2O emissions, or yields through time. In our sandy loam soils, no-till cropping enhances C storage, aggregation, and associated environmental processes with no significant ecological or yield tradeoffs.

AB  - Understanding the recharge-discharge system of a catchment is key to the efficient use and effective management of groundwater resources. The present study focused on the estimation of groundwater recharge using Soil Moisture Balance (SMB) and Baseflow Separation (BFS) methods in the Gilgel Gibe catchment where water demand for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes is dramatically increasing. The demand for groundwater and the existing ambitious plans to respond to this demand will put a strain on the groundwater resource in the catchment unless prompt intervention is undertaken to ensure its sustainability. Ground-based hydrometeorological 36-years data (1985 to 2020) from 17 stations and satellite products from CHIRPS and NASA/POWER were used for the SMB method. Six BFS methods were applied through the Web-based Hydrograph Analysis Tool (WHAT), SepHydro, BFLOW, and Automated Computer Programming (PART) to sub-catchments and the main catchment to estimate the groundwater recharge. The streamflow data (discharge) obtained from the Ministry of Water and Energy were the main input data for the BFS methods. The average annual recharge of groundwater was estimated to be 313 mm using SMB for the years 1985 to 2020 and 314 mm using BFS for the years 1986 to 2003. The results from the SMB method revealed geographical heterogeneity in annual groundwater recharge, varying from 209 to 442 mm. Significant spatial variation is also observed in the estimated annual groundwater recharge using the BFS methods, which varies from 181 to 411 mm for sub-catchments. Hydrogeological conditions of the catchment were observed, and the yielding capacity of existing wells was assessed to evaluate the validity of the results. The recharge values estimated using SMB and BFS methods are comparable and hydrologically reasonable. The findings remarkably provide insightful information for decision-makers to develop effective groundwater management strategies and to prioritize the sub-catchments for immediate intervention to ensure the sustainability of groundwater.

AB  - Earth's land surface is characterized by tremendous natural heterogeneity and human-engineered modifications, both of which are challenging to represent in land surface models. Satellite remote sensing is often the most practical and effective method to observe the land surface over large geographical areas. Agricultural irrigation is an important human-induced modification to natural land surface processes, as it is pervasive across the world and because of its significant influence on the regional and global water budgets. In this article, irrigation is used as an example of a human-engineered, often unmodeled land surface process, and the utility of satellite soil moisture retrievals over irrigated areas in the continental US is examined. Such retrievals are based on passive or active microwave observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission, WindSat and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT). The analysis suggests that the skill of these retrievals for representing irrigation effects is mixed, with ASCAT-based products somewhat more skillful than SMOS and AMSR2 products. The article then examines the suitability of typical bias correction strategies in current land data assimilation systems when unmodeled processes dominate the bias between the model and the observations. Using a suite of synthetic experiments that includes bias correction strategies such as quantile mapping and trained forward modeling, it is demonstrated that the bias correction practices lead to the exclusion of the signals from unmodeled processes, if these processes are the major source of the biases. It is further shown that new methods are needed to preserve the observational information about unmodeled processes during data assimilation.

AB  - This study estimated seasonal variations among several parameters of the fine roots and N dynamics in Mangifera indica-based agroforestry systems; we examined homegarden (HG), agri-horticulture (AH) and agri-horti-silviculture (AHS) systems in the Bhabhar area of the Indian Central Himalayan region. Fine roots biomass (FRB) and fine roots production (FRP) of M. indica were highest in the AH system and lowest in the HG system while fine roots turnover (FRT) showed a reverse trend. FRB, FRP and FRT rates decreased with soil depth and distance from the tree base, with larger variations in the AH system. The biomass: necromass ratio varied between 1.91 and 2.42 for HG, between 2.27 and 3.29 for AH and between 2.09 and 2.46 for AHS systems. Among all the selected agroforestry systems, concentrations of mineral N (NH4-N and NO3-N) were higher in the AH system and lower in the AHS system while net N mineralization rates were higher in the AHS system. In HGs, FRB it was significantly correlated with ammonification, nitrification and N mineralization while in the AH system it was positively correlated with nitrification and N mineralization. In the AHS system, it was positively correlated with ammonification only. Thus, it can be concluded that in agroforestry systems FRB was enhanced by rapid N mineralization. The variability in FRB and N mineralization between selected agroforestry systems were possibly due to the differences in soil characteristics and management practices. For enrichment of soil nutrients, the contribution of fine roots could be of more importance through the process of decomposition under the prevailing agroforestry systems.

AB  - Approximately 3.1 Mha (22%) of the agricultural area of south-eastern Australia can be classified as native pasture. There is the assumption that, owing to the widespread occurrence of low-fertility soils in Australia, native grass species do not respond to increased phosphorus (P) fertility. Currently, there are no industry recommendations of target soil-test P values for native-grass-based pastures. This paper reviews the responses of perennial native pasture species endemic to south-eastern Australia to P application in controlled environments, surveys, replicated experiments and paired-paddock trials. Eighty-seven site-years of trial data where different levels of P were applied, conducted over the last two decades, on native-based pastures in south-eastern Australia are reviewed. Data indicate that application of P fertilisers to native grass pastures can increase dry matter (DM) production and maintain pasture stability. However, minimum targets for herbage mass (800 kg DM/ha) and groundcover (80%) are required to ensure persistence of perennial native grasses. Stocking rates also need to match carrying capacity of the pasture. Based on previous research, we recommend target soil-test (Olsen; 0-10 cm) P levels for fertility-tolerant native grass pastures, based on Microlaena stipoides, Rytidosperma caespitosum, R. fulvum, R. richardsonii, R. duttonianum and R. racemosum, of 10-13 mg/kg, whereas for pastures based on fertility-intolerant species such as Themeda triandra, lower levels of <6 mg/kg are required to ensure botanical stability.

AB  - Crop rotation affects the decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) and thereby alter the composition of SOM fractions. It remains unclear how different SOM fractions impact soil nitrogen (N) transformation in various rotation systems. The aim of this study was to ascertain the role of particulate organic matter (POM)-a labile SOM fraction-in soil N transformation under various crop rotations. A paired plot experiment was conducted under two common cropping patterns, i.e., rice-rapeseed rotation (RR) vs. rice-wheat rotation (RW). Soil chemical composition and organic matter fraction before rice transplanting were compared between RR and RW systems after four years of crop rotations (2017-2021). With the same N inputs, the rice yield and N uptake under RR were 16.4 % and 13.2 % higher than those under RW, respectively. Compared with RW, RR resulted in higher carbon (C) and N contents in soil POM, despite minimal differences in total SOM. A larger potentially mineralizable N pool and a higher N mineralization rate occurred under RR than under RW, based on the results of soil net mineralization experiment. When POM was incubated alone, its contribution to potentially mineralizable N was 65.1 % and 61.3 % in RR and RW soils, respectively. Infrared spectroscopy revealed that in contrast with RW, RR promoted the accumulation of organic matter with high bioavailability (e.g., amides, carbohydrates, polysaccharides) in soil POM. This might be responsible for the higher gross mineralization and nitrification rates but lower gross immobilization rate under RR than under RW. Consequently, RR not only increased the contents of POMC and POMN but also improved the quality of POM fraction in soils. Findings of the present study demonstrate that POM plays a distinct role in soil N mineralization in various rotation systems. The discrepancy in POM content and composition resulting from various crop rotations leads to differences in soil N mineralization, which in turn affects the N supply and rice yield.

AB  - Context: Effective vineyard decision making at strategic and operational timescales requires consideration of many factors, including vineyard design and management options, exogenous factors that are outside of the decision maker's control such as climate/weather, and desired outcomes such as yield and grape composition attributes. Process-based models enable prediction of vineyard outcomes in response to different decisions and with respect to exogenous factors. Objective: We present a review of process-based models that can simulate both key vineyard outcomes and their sensitivity to decisions and exogenous factors, and highlight how these models can 'bridge the gap' between data and decisions. Methods: We assess the suitability of process-based models to water, canopy and nutrient management contexts using a conceptual systems framework. Results and Conclusions:Currently available process-based models are most advanced in terms of supporting decisions regarding water management, and least advanced regarding nutrient management. They are also better suited to support decisions with respect to yield, compared to grape composition attributes. Significance: This paper provides guidance to modelling practitioners regarding appropriate process-based models for a range of vineyard decision contexts and assists viticulturists and decision makers in understanding how these models can support decisions for improved outcomes.

AB  - The co-production and co-application to land of biochar and biosolids may make conventional wastewater treatment more sustainable; therefore, this study provides a first life cycle evaluation of the co-location of a pyrolysis (biochar production) plant with a municipal wastewater treatment plant. Life cycle energy use and greenhouse gas emissions are evaluated for the co-production of these two materials. Three US national scenarios are included: biosolids only produced and disposed of as is the current common practice in the US (landfilled, incinerated, and land applied); biosolids only produced but not land applied; and co-production of biosolids and biochar and their disposal as currently practiced. A case study is also presented with slightly different disposal practices. Large contributors to life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are from the disposal of biosolids in landfills and incinerators, making alternatives like land application attractive for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The addition of biochar production adds little to the overall energy use but provides substantial (26%) reduction in greenhouse gas emissions for the national case, largely due to the recalcitrant carbon storage in biochar. Because biochar production is an energy positive process, incorporation of the energy co-products into the plant is explored for producing high quality Class A biosolids. The addition of biochar to biosolids is shown to be more sustainable from a co-production standpoint This study contributes a benchmark analysis in evaluating the co-production of biochar and biosolids for potential environmental, economic, and health benefits and the results are useful for utility planning.

AB  - Soil nitrogen (N) dynamics in croplands need to be improved for the increase of food production in sub-Saharan Africa. Our objective was to investigate the crop residue management in terms of quality and application method to improve soil N dynamics during the period of crop growth in maize croplands with special reference to soil textures in dry tropical agroecosystems. Field experiments were conducted during the rainy seasons of 2012 and 2013 at clayey and sandy sites in Tanzania. Five treatment plots were established: plots with no residue applied (Ctrl plot), chemical fertilizer applied (F plot), maize residue (high C:N ratio = 60) incorporated (M-In plot) or mulched (M-On plot), and cowpea residue (low C: N ratio = 21) incorporated (P-In plot). In each plot, we regularly collected surface soil and crop samples and measured inorganic N (NO3--N and NH4+-N), the soil respiration rate, and crop N uptake. Rainfall and soil moisture content were also continuously monitored. Our results showed that cowpea residue with high biodegradability caused prompt increases in the soil respiration rate and soil inorganic N because decomposition of the applied residue occurred within ca. 2 weeks after the application at both the clayey and sandy sites. It resulted in high N use efficiency in the early growing period and 18-73% higher total crop N uptake than that in the maize residue plots at both sites. The application methods (incorporation and mulching) showed no significant difference in soil N dynamics and crop yield, although higher soil respiration was observed in the M-In plot than the M-On plot at the clayey site. However, at the sandy site, mulching of maize residue resulted in the increased soil inorganic N content in the M-On plot by 18-26% compared with that in the M-In plot during the cropping season because of the higher soil moisture content. Consequently, crop N uptake in the mulching plot resulted in 26-59% higher than that in the incorporation plot.

AB  - Smart agriculture (SA) based on the framework of precision agriculture (PA) is a vital component of sustainable and efficient food production, with nitrogen (N) management playing a pivotal role. However, existing agricultural practices often suffer from low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), posing a challenge to SA. To tackle this issue, real-time N sensing technologies offer farmers precise and timely information about soil N levels, enabling precise N fertilizer application. Integrating these technologies with the Internet of Things (IoT) can further augment their capabilities, creating a seamless platform for data collection, analysis, and decision-making for great opportunities to improve NUE. Nevertheless, the adoption of real-time N sensing and IoT integration also presents several challenges, including selecting appropriate sensing technologies, effective data mining and management, and acquiring specialized knowledge and training. This review paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the opportunities and challenges associated with real-time N sensing technologies and IoT integration in smart farming. By showcasing best practices and innovative solutions, the paper aims to foster widespread adoption of SA practices, ultimately elevating the sustainability and productivity of agricultural systems.

AB  - Soil fertility depletion in smallholder farms is one of the fundamental biophysical causes for declining per capita food production in Ethiopia. In the present study, we assess soil nutrient depletion and its spatial variability for Ethiopia and its regional states, using nutrient balances as a tool. Data on crop production, fertilizer use and land management practices were collected from the Agricultural sample survey, which was carried out by the Central Statistics Authority (CSA) for the production year 1999/2000. We used a Geographic Information System (GIS) to process, and analyze spatially referenced information like soil properties, precipitation and land use types. We calculated nutrient balances for N, P and K from five nutrient fluxes entering and five nutrient fluxes leaving cultivated lands of smallholders. Some of the fluxes (e.g. leaching, denitrification and wet deposition) were estimated using transfer functions. Erosion was estimated by universal soil loss equation (USLE) and landscape process modelling at multi-dimensions and scales (LAPSUS). At the national level, full nutrient balance results indicate a depletion rate of 122 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1), 13 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) and 82 kg K ha(-1) yr(-1). Soil nutrient stocks in all regional states were decreasing with the exception of areas under permanent and vegetable crops. In the analysis, soil erosion was the major cause for nutrients depletion, but this flux shows significant variability between different estimates and was highly uncertain. We calculated that the contribution of erosion to N losses was 70%, while its contribution to P and K losses were 80% and 63%, respectively. Nutrient losses under permanent and vegetable cropping were caused mainly by residues removal, harvested products and leaching, while losses under cereals and other annuals were dominated by erosion.

AB  - In agricultural crop production, information important for optimizing production processes (precision farming) and reducing the environmental impact can be obtained from soils and plants with sensors. Ranging sensors are utilized in research activities that use remote-sensing techniques. In this work, three types of ranging sensors or measuring principles (light detection and ranging (LiDAR), radar, and ultrasonic) are evaluated for practical use with agricultural machinery to improve production processes. In the first part of this article, the fundamentals of the prescribed measuring principles are described. Based on the relevant literature, state-of-the-art sensor groups for measuring morphologic crop stand and orchard parameters are presented and discussed in the second section. In the third section, the sensors are assessed regarding their suitability for installation on agricultural machinery under field conditions; specifically, their functional parameters are evaluated (e.g., working distance, mounting height, inclination angle, resolution, and measurement frequency) along with experimental data obtained in scientific investigations. The positive test results in the application of the measuring principles presented in previous publications are reviewed and, based on a summary assessment, the LiDAR measuring principle is indicated as the preferred solution for vehicle-based measurement of crop stand and orchard parameters.

AB  - Potassium- (K) and water-stratification in conservation tillage, rain-fed agroecosystems may reduce soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] performance. A split-pot experiment with two soil-K levels [80 mg Kg(-1) (Low-K) and 164 mg Kg(-1) (Optimum-K)] and two soil-water contents [insufficient (Dry): variable between 55 to 85% field capacity (FC); sufficient (Wet): constant at 85 to 95% FC] was imposed to determine the effect of synchronous and asynchronous availability of localized K and soil water on soybean roots, nutrient uptake, and shoot growth. Asynchrony of soil water and K had no impact on soybean dry matter accumulation or nutrient uptake. Optimum soil K levels were relatively more important than soil water content to increase K availability and K tissue concentration and accumulation. Shoot- and root-growth responded more to water- than to K-stress. Shoot-K accumulation increased concomitantly with sufficient water availability and greater root surface area (RSA), but RSA was more important relative to water for K accumulation. Optimum-K with sufficient-water increased K accumulation by 50% compared to the insufficient-water treatment. Since enhanced K uptake occurred with greater RSA, and roots proliferated in response to water availability and not localized K, K should be placed in the soil fraction that provides sufficient water availability.

AB  - The period of extreme weather anomalies in recent years has challenged farmers, and this has encouraged greater adaptability in farming practices. In the last decade, conventional tillage systems have been complemented by more biologically based cropping systems. The research evaluated the impact of drought on soil physical parameters in maize production by testing different conventional and non-conventional tillage systems to ensure optimal soil physical parameters. In the analysis of the prevailing weather conditions, rainfall values were divided into two parts, the pre-growing season and the growing season. We studied different climatic seasons. In 2021, the soil moisture content in the upper shallow 15 cm soil layer during the sowing period in April in the case of conventional tillage was significantly lower than in reduced tillage, conservation tillage and strip tillage. The most significant difference was measured between conventional and conservation tillage, with a difference of 11.25 v/v%. The 2022 crop year was extremely dry. In June, the highest moisture value in the soil was measured in the case of strip tillage with a value of 21.64 v/v%, which was more than 60% higher than in the case of conventional and conservation tillage. In conventional tillage, a very pronounced compacted layer was observed in the lower part of the ploughed layer. This zone reached a compaction of 6.9 MPa between 28 and 34 cm, which is agronomically harmful. No compacted soil layer was found in the experiment site under conservation tillage. In the severe drought year of 2022, only the strip-till system provided the proper water management conditions for the maize stand.

AB  - Background Soil respiration (S-R) is a critical process for understanding the impact of climatic conditions and land degradation on the carbon cycle in terrestrial ecosystems. We measured the S-R and soil environmental factors over 1 year in four land uses with varying levels of disturbance and different vegetation types viz., mixed forest cover (MFC), Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) forest cover (PFC), agricultural field (AF), and vegetable field (VF), in a semi-arid area of Delhi, India. Our primary aim was to assess the effects of soil moisture (S-M), soil temperature (S-T), and soil microbial activity (S-MA) on the S-R. Methods The S-R was measured monthly using an LI-6400 with an infrared gas analyser and a soil chamber. The S-M was measured using the gravimetric method. The S-T (10 cm) was measured with a probe attached to the LI-6400. The S-MA was determined by fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis. Results The S-R showed seasonal variations, with the mean annual S-R ranging from 3.22 to 5.78 mu mol m(-2) s(-1) and higher S-R rates of similar to 15-55% in the cultivated fields (AF, VF) than in the forest sites (MFC, PFC). The VF had significantly higher S-R (P < 0.05) than the other land uses (AF, PFC, MFC), which did not vary significantly from one another in S-R (P < 0.05). The repeated measures ANOVA evaluated the significant differences (P < 0.05) in the S-R for high precipitation months (July, August, September, February). The S-M as a single factor showed a strong significant relationship in all the land uses (R-2 = 0.67-0.91, P < 0.001). The effect of the S-T on the S-R was found to be weak and non-significant in the PFC, MFC, and AF (R-2 = 0.14-0.31; P > 0.05). Contrasting results were observed in the VF, which showed high S-R during summer (May; 11.21 mu mol m(-2) s(-1)) and a significant exponential relationship with the S-T (R-2 = 0.52; P < 0.05). The S-R was positively related to the S-MA (R-2 = 0.44-0.5; P < 0.001). The interactive equations based on the independent variables S-M, S-T, and S-MA explained 91-95% of the seasonal variation in S-R with better model performance in the cultivated land use sites (AF, VF). Conclusion S-M was the key determining factor of the S-R in semi-arid ecosystems and explained similar to 90% of the variation. Precipitation increased S-R by optimizing the S-M and microbial activity. The S-MA, along with the other soil factors S-M and S-T, improved the correlation with S-R. Furthermore, the degraded land uses will be more susceptible to temporal variations in S-R under changing climatic scenarios, which may influence the carbon balance of these ecosystems.

AB  - Process-based grass models (PBGMs) are widely used for predicting grass growth under potential climate change and different management practices. However, accurate predictions using PBGMs heavily rely on field observations for data assimilation. In data-limited areas, performing robust and reliable estimates of grass growth remains a challenge. In this paper, we incorporated satellite-based MODIS data products, including leaf area index, gross primary production and evapotranspiration, as an additional supplement to field observations. Popular data assimilation methods, including Bayesian calibration and the updating method ensemble Kalman filter, were applied to assimilate satellite derived information into the BASic GRAssland model (BASGRA). A range of different combinations of data assimilating methods and data availability were tested across four grassland sites in Norway, Finland and Canada to assess the corresponding accuracy and make recommendations regarding suitable approaches to incorporate MODIS data. The results demonstrated that optimizing the model parameters that are specific for grass species and cultivar should be targeted prior to updating model state variables. The MODIS derived data products were capable of constraining model's simulations on phenological development and biomass accumulation by parameter optimization with its performance exceeding model outputs driven by default parameters. By integrating even a small number of field measurements into the parameter calibration, the model's predictive accuracy was further improved - especially at sites with obvious biases in the input MODIS data. Overall, this comparative study has provided flexible solutions with the potential to strengthen the capacity of PBGMs for grass growth estimation in practical applications.

AB  - Sloping hills ravaged by shifting cultivation often causes soil erosion problems in the downstream cultivated lands. This study was carried out in the highland zone of Eastern India to evaluate selected horti-silvi-pastoral systems in terms of soil carbon build up, soil aggregation and soil moisture retention in a degraded sloping land. The experiment was taken up during 2000-2006 in a degraded hillock of about 4.0 ha area with eight treatments involving two fruit species (cashew and guava), two grass species (Stylosanthes hamata and natural grass) and two in situ (trench or no-trench) moisture conservation measures. Hedge rows of Indigofera teysmanni (silviculture component) were used uniformly for all the treatments. Trenches of 0.45 m x 0.45 m x 1.0 m dimension at 0.5 m u/s side of fruit plants conserved 2.18 g 100 g(-1) higher soil moisture on an average in the 0-30 cm layer. The effect of fruit tree component was visible during 6th year of study in terms of soil organic carbon (SOC) only. In 6 years, the average increase in SOC and water stable aggregates in the 0-30 cm profile was 89% and 46% under rehabilitation treatments. The SOC stock at the end of 6 years was 34-40 Mg ha(-1) in the 0-30 cm profile under treatments as compared to 21 Mg ha(-1) under control. The SOC build up rate increased linearly with time and the average rates were 4.5, 3.5 and 0.64 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for Stylosanthes and natural grass based treatments and control, respectively. In all the systems, macroaggregates (>250 mu m) were higher in proportion and contained higher organic carbon. Guava + Stylosanthes + Trench system proved better in terms of soil carbon build up, soil aggregation and soil moisture retention. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study evaluated the performance of deep learning (DL), artificial neural network (ANN) and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) models to estimate field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) using four combinations of soil data. The DL, ANN and kNN models are compared with the previous published pedotransfer functions (PTF). The data consist of 256 calcareous soil samples collected from Konya-Cumra plain, Turkey. The results demonstrated that the DL_a with inputs of soil texture components, bulk density, organic matter and lime contents, particle density and aggregate stability showed the best performances with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.829, correlation coefficient (r) of 0.911, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.027 and relative root mean square error (RRMSE) 9.397 % in FC estimation for calcareous soil samples. For the PWP estimation of calcareous soil samples, the kNN_b with soil texture components, bulk density, organic matter and lime content and particle density indicated the best performance with the value of R-2 to 0.800, of r to 0.894, of MAE to 0.021 and RRMSE to 12.043 %. Lastly, the results showed that the DL, ANN and the kNN models perform better than the previously applied PTF for calcareous soils. Therefore, the DL model could be recommended for the estimation of FC when full soil data are available and the kNN model could be recommended for estimation of PWP with all combinations of soil data.

AB  - Mountainous regions are highly hazardous, and these hazards often lead to loss of human life. The Hindu Kush Himalaya (HKH), like many mountainous regions, is the site of multiple and overlapping natural hazards, but the distribution of multi-hazard risk and the populations exposed to it are poorly understood. Here, we present high-resolution transboundary models describing susceptibility to floods, landslides, and wildfires to understand population exposure to multi-hazard risk across the HKH. These models are created from historical remotely sensed data and hazard catalogs by the maximum entropy (Maxent) machine learning technique. Our results show that human settlements in the HKH are disproportionately concentrated in areas of high multi-hazard risk. In contrast, low-hazard areas are disproportionately unpopulated. Nearly half of the population in the region lives in areas that are highly susceptible to more than one hazard. Warm low-altitude foothill areas with perennially moist soils were identified as highly susceptible to multiple hazards. This area comprises only 31% of the study region, but is home to 49% of its population. The results also show that areas susceptible to multiple hazards are also major corridors of current migration and urban expansion, suggesting that current rates and patterns of urbanization will continue to put more people at risk. This study establishes that the population in the HKH is concentrated in areas susceptible to multiple hazards and suggests that current patterns of human movement will continue to increase exposure to multi-hazards in the HKH.

AB  - We conducted a PUB (predictions in ungauged basins) experiment looking at hydrology and crop dynamics in the semi-arid rural Mod catchment in India. The experiment was motivated by the aims (a) to develop a coupled eco-hydrological model capable of analysing land-use strategies concerning crop water need, erosion protection, crop yield and resistivity against droughts and floods, and (b) to assess the feasibility of a strategy for collecting the necessary data in a data-scarce region. Our experiment combines parsimonious data assessment and eco-hydrological model coupling at the lower mesoscale. Linking bottom-up sampling of functionally representative soil classes and top-down regionalization based on spectral properties of the same resulted in a comprehensive distributed data basis for the model. A clear focus on the dominating processes and the catena as the organizing landscape element in the given environmental setting enabled this. We employed the WASA (Water Availability in Semi-Arid environments) model for uncalibrated process-based water balance modelling and integrated a crop simulation subroutine based on the SWAP (Soil Water Atmosphere Plant) model to account for crop dynamics, feedbacks and yield estimation. While we found the data assessment strategy and the hydrological model application largely feasible, in terms of its accounting for scale, processes and model concepts, the simulation of feedbacks with crops was problematic. Contributing to the PUB issue, more general conclusions are drawn concerning spatially-distributed structural information and uncalibrated modelling.

AB  - Reducing tillage in organic bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) production may be facilitated by strategic use of fall-seeded cover crops. This study characterized the effects of fall rye (Secale cereal L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and oat (Avena sativa L) cover crops on soil environment, weeds, and bean growth and development. It was repeated twice in Manitoba, Canada with cover crop type and tillage treatments in a factorial experiment. Cover crops were seeded in fall each year (2010 and 2011). Greater cover crop biomass and lower available soil N at bean planting for rye was attributed to rye spring growth. In the till managed treatment, cover crops were tilled immediately before bean planting. Cover crop management in the no till treatment involved flail mowing (18 days after bean planting in 2011 and 11 days after bean planting in 2012) in the fall rye treatment and flaming immediately after bean planting in the frost-killed barley, oat and control treatments. Rye reduced soil temperature and early season bean development. Bean population density was unaffected by tillage or cover management despite 5604 kg ha(-1) of rye biomass at planting. Green foxtail (Setaria viridis) populations were decreased with rye only in no-till plots. Dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) was unaffected by treatments, while redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) and barnyard grass (Echinochloa crus-galli) populations were lower in no-till plots. Rye reduced weed biomass but not bean biomass at harvest; however, bean yield was lower with rye compared with other cover crops in both years. It was concluded while frost-killed cover crops did not provide sufficient weed suppression, fall rye provided too much competition against the bean crop. No-till management did not improve rye's overall effectiveness. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Soil water content is a vital resource that plays a central role in agricultural areas. In Argentina the soybean (Glycine max (L) Merrill) is the most important crop, considering the economic yield and the sown area. Actually, remote sensing allows continuous monitoring of crops and to evaluate the impact of water stress in their development. The combination of Land Surface Temperature (LST) and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is an indicator that provides information about the condition of the vegetation and surface soil moisture content. In this study we evaluate relationships between indicators of crop water stress and the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) determined from Landsat, for sites with rainfed soybean in the agricultural central zone of Cordoba (Argentina).
   Field data were acquired continuously throughout the whole growing season. For each sample date and plot, data of percent green vegetation cover, soil moisture content and phenology were registered. The use of a simulation crop model allowed obtaining indicators of crop water stress indices: (1) soil water deficit, (2) crop water use vs. reference crop evapotranspiration, and (3) fraction of the available water capacity that is readily available.
   The NDVI/LST spaces presented a trapezoidal form, which indicated that TVDI will have similar sensitivity for the full range of NDVI and showed temporal changes of wet and dry edges.
   When soybean cover exceeds 60%, the combination of TVDI with (2) and (3) can enhance the ability of detecting crop water stress conditions (R-2 = 0.62 and 0.82, respectively). However, the relationship between TVDI and (1) showed low correlation values (R-2 = 0.21). (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Skillful forecasts of extreme weather events have a major socioeconomic relevance. Here, we compare two complementary approaches to diagnose the predictability of extreme weather: recent developments in dynamical systems theory and numerical ensemble weather forecasts. The former allows us to define atmospheric configurations in terms of their persistence and local dimension, which provides information on how the atmosphere evolves to and from a given state of interest. These metrics may be used as proxies for the intrinsic predictability of the atmosphere, which only depends on the atmosphere's properties. Ensemble weather forecasts provide information on the practical predictability of the atmosphere, which partly depends on the performance of the numerical model used. We focus on heat waves affecting the eastern Mediterranean. These are identified using the climatic stress index (CSI), which was explicitly developed for the summer weather conditions in this region and differentiates between heat waves (upper decile) and cool days (lower decile). Significant differences are found between the two groups from both the dynamical systems and the numerical weather prediction perspectives. Specifically, heat waves show relatively stable flow characteristics (high intrinsic predictability) but comparatively low practical predictability (large model spread and error). For 500 hPa geopotential height fields, the intrinsic predictability of heat waves is lowest at the event's onset and decay. We relate these results to the physical processes governing eastern Mediterranean summer heat waves: adiabatic descent of the air parcels over the region and the geographical origin of the air parcels over land prior to the onset of a heat wave. A detailed analysis of the mid-August 2010 record-breaking heat wave provides further insights into the range of different regional atmospheric configurations conducive to heat waves. We conclude that the dynamical systems approach can be a useful complement to conventional numerical forecasts for understanding the dynamics and predictability of eastern Mediterranean heat waves.

AB  - Drought is one of the most damaging and complicated disasters in the world. Timely monitoring of droughts over agro-ecosystem is important for reducing yield loss. The potential of satellite-borne solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) for drought detection and assessment were explored in this study. As denoted by the significant negative anomalies of standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), precipitation (PPT), soil moisture (SM) and positive anomalies of land surface temperature (LST) and air temperature difference (DT), a severe drought event was detected at summer maize growth period in 2014 over the North China Plain. In the duration of this drought, the anomalies of SIF and SIFyield (SIF normalized by absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) were negative. The regional averaged SIF and SIFyield declined 9.0% and 9.3% in July, and 11.9% and 12.5% in August, respectively, higher than those of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (4.8% in July and 3.5% in August) and land surface water index (LSWI) (8.2% in July and 4.9% in August). In addition, the linear relationship between gross primary productivity (GPP) and SIF (R-2=0.85) was more significant than that between GPP and NDVI (R-2=0.60). The GPP estimated by SIF decreased by 10.6% in counties with severe drought in 2014, which was consistent with the yield reduction (9.1%) estimated by county statistical yield data. It is concluded that satellite SIF is more reliable and effective for regional drought monitoring and assessment, which can help policy-makers or farmers implement appropriate measures to mitigate the drought disasters.

AB  - This study provides a general methodology based on genetic programming (GP) to identify nonlinear multi-physics systems. The proposed GP-based method aims to discover governing equations for the systems, characterized by a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs), solely from the measured data. The GP-based methodology employs expression trees, having mathematical components in their nodes, to randomly construct candidate models (i.e., ODEs) for the systems and fits them into the measured data set by applying evolutionary processes (e.g., crossover and mutation) over consecutive generations. To enhance the convergence of the identification process, the model fitness is evaluated by computing model outputs that are numerical solutions of the ODEs (i.e., candidate models) under the measured input, and comparing them to the measured output. The proposed generalization of the GP-based method leads to an additional computational burden which is resolved with parallel processing on high-performance computing systems. We demonstrate the applicability of the methodology to two distinct models originating from different physical systems: a Bouc-Wen model from mechanics and an environmental soil-moisture model from ecohydrology. For the Bouc-Wen model, governing equations that are close to the reference model were discovered. The GP-identified models yielded output errors less than 8%, regardless of errors embedded in training data, up to 5%. For the soil-moisture model, relatively simple models are identified with output errors similar to, or less than, 10%. It is shown that the method under discussion is useful in providing some physical insight into the equations that govern complex, nonlinear, multi-physics systems.

AB  - The Three-River Headwater Region (TRHR) has undergone significant hydrological changes and affects the water resources security in the local and downstream areas. We use multiple observational precipitation product, as well as the ERA5 reanalysis dataset to investigate the precipitation variations over the TRHR during the rainy season from 1990 to 2020, and to analyze the contributions of local evaporation and remote water vapor transport to the precipitation and its variations. The precipitation shows a significant increasing trend (17.8 mm decade(-1)). The precipitation variability (PV) is larger at daily scale and smaller at interannual scale. The spatial distribution of PV varies on different timescales, which reflects the different dominant regimes driving the moisture transport. The mean precipitation in the TRHR is predominantly contributed by western and southern moisture influxes, and the increasing trend of these influxes (10.8 kg s(-1) decade(-1)) determines the precipitation increase. Local evaporation provide about 6% of water vapor for the precipitation, while it has little influence on the precipitation change. The anomalous precipitation in wet and dry years is mainly controlled by the atmospheric circulation over the Tibetan Plateau, which regulates the southwestern moisture transport towards the TRHR. Additionally, the precipitation during 1990-2020 increases by about 3.9% compared to that during 1960-1989. It is related to the higher conversion ratio of water vapor influxes to precipitation and larger evaporation over the TRHR. These findings improve our understanding of the precipitation variations in the TRHR and provide insights for policy makers to optimize water resources management to cope with the global climate change.

AB  - Although general approaches to the effect of water on the mechanisms causing landslides have been adopted, the work presented in this paper was carried out to quantify the landslide susceptibility variation in space and time, integrating the soil moisture distribution and routing (SMDR) model and landslide susceptibility concept. The approach proposed in the present study reflects the temporal effects of the saturation degree index (SDI) on landslide susceptibility as a new index to understand the effect of soil saturation. The topographic wetness index (TWI) is a conventional parameter that represents the relative wetness on landsliding. The new proposed landslide susceptibility approach is used in the study area to understand the effect of soil saturation and the emergence of the Dereba landslide in the study area. The comparative results of landslide susceptibility maps obtained from the new approach utilizing the proposed SDI and conventional TWI are remarkable. Accordingly, a new substantial method is proposed using the attainable monthly mean meteorological data to generate monthly landslide susceptibility maps. The results obtained for the Dereba landslide using the proposed method are validated with the other landslide that has occurred in the same watershed. The results revealed that the approach proposed in this study was compatible with the landslide mechanism in the study area and may help to express the water effect in landslide susceptibility analyses.

AB  - Content of N and C in soil were investigated in a long-term field experiment under different systems of N fertilization. Chernozem and Cambisol were extracted using hot water (N-hws, C-hws and 0.01M CaCl2 (N-CaCl2, C-DOC). The C-t/N-t ratio in Chernozem was 9.6:1 and in Cambisol 6.1:1. The lowest Ct/Nt ratio in both experiments was found in the control treatment. Results showed that C and N compounds are less stable in Cambisol, which leads to a higher rate of mineralization. In the Chernozem, N-hws formed 3.66% from the total N content in the soil whereas N-CaCl2 formed only 0.82%. C-hws formed 2.98% and C-DOC 0.34% from total C content. Cambisol contains 4.81% of N-hws and 0.84% of N-CaCl2 from the total N amount and 5.76% of Chws and 0.70% of C-DOC from the total C content, respectively. Nitrogen extracted by 0.01M CaCl2 formed only 22.4% of N extractable by hot water in Chernozem and 17.5% in Cambisol. The lowest C/N ratios were obtained after the CaCl2 extraction (3.0-6.2:1). The application of manure increased the content of soil organic N and C compared to the sewage sludge treatments.

AB  - Many desert soil profiles of the southwestern United States show substantial accumulations of nitrate beneath the active rooting zone. At present, the mechanisms and processes for such enrichment are not well understood. This study focuses on the role of availability of water (depth to groundwater), soil (C:N) and vegetation (root density) associated with vadose zone nitrate accumulation in mesic desert regions of Nevada. The field study was conducted at four locations in Spanish Spring Valley, Nevada under native vegetation (Artemesia tridentata, Chrysothamnus nauseosus or mixed) with varying groundwater depths. Soil samples were collected from shallow root zone (0-45 cm) and deep vadose zones and analysed for nitrate-nitrogen (NO3--N), ammonium (NH4+-N) and chloride (Cl-). From the shallow root zone samples root densities and soil C:N were determined. Soil profiles developed under deep water table conditions showed an accumulation of NO3--N (800 mg l(-1)) in the vadose zone, while very little nitrogen accumulation was found in presence of shallow groundwater location. Availability of water controlled vegetation (root growth) and soil C:N. We conclude that soil resources (water and organic carbon) and rare leaching events are the primary factors lead to accumulation of NO3--N in this region. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Currently, the urgency of balancing rice production and environmental risk from nitrogen (N) fertilization is gaining scientific and public attention. As such, a field experiment was conducted to investigate the rice yield and the fate of applied-N-15 for Yangliangyou 6 (a two-line hybrid cultivar) and Lvdaoq 7 (an inbred cultivar) using 10 combinations of N rates and splitting ratios in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The results showed that N application primarily affected fertilizer N loss to the environment, followed by plant N absorption, but had little effect on grain yield. Generally, there was no significant increase in grain yield and N accumulation in the aboveground plant when N inputs surpassed 130 or 170 kg ha(-1). Fertilizer N residue in soil peaked at approximately 48 kg ha(-1) at an N rate of 170 kg ha(-1) for both varieties; however, a sharp increase of fertilizer N loss occurred with further incrementally increasing N rates. Although a higher ratio of panicle-N fertilizer together with a lower ratio of tillering-N fertilizer at rates of 130, 170, and 210 kg ha(-1) had no grain yield benefit, it promoted aboveground N accumulation and plant N accumulation derived from fertilizer, and it reduced the amount of N residue in soil and N loss to the environment. Overall, reducing tillering-N ratios and increasing panicle-N ratios at an N rate between 130 and 170 kg ha(-1) using fertilizer rates of 90-0-40 kg ha(-1) and 90-40-40 kg ha(-1) N at basal-tillering-panicle initiation stages could reduce the adverse environmental risks of chemical N from rice production without sacrificing rice yield.

AB  - Tillage and residue retention affect nitrogen (N) dynamics and nutrient losses and therefore nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and crop fertilizer use, however, there is little information about residual fertilizer effects on the subsequent crop. Micro-plots with N-15-labelled urea were established in 2014/2015 on a long-term experiment on a Vertisol in north-west Mexico. N fertilizer recovery (NFR) and the effects of residual fertilizer N for summer maize (Zea mays L.) and the subsequent wheat (Triticum durum L.) crop were studied in three tillage-straw management practices (CTB: conventionally tilled beds; PB-straw: permanent raised beds with residue retention; PB-burn: permanent raised beds with residue burning). Fertilizer N-15 recovery rates for maize grain across all treatments were low with an average of 11%, but after wheat harvest total recovered N-15 (N-15 in maize and wheat straw and grain, residual soil N-15) was over 50% for the PB-burn treatment. NFR was lowest in CTB after two cropping cycles (32%). Unaccounted N from applied fertilizer for the maize crop averaged 120 kg N-15 ha(-1) after wheat harvest. However, more than 20% of labelled N-15 was found in the 0-90 cm soil profile in both PB treatments after wheat harvest, which highlights the need for long-term studies and continuous monitoring of the soil nutrient status to avoid over-application of mineral N fertilizer.

AB  - In smallholder farms throughout subSaharan Africa, it is a common pattern for some fields to receive substantial inputs of fertilisers and manure, but others to receive nutrient inputs infrequently or never. A soil and crop model, SCAN, based on annual summary of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus dynamics was calibrated against chronosequences on coarse soils in semi-arid Zimbabwe, giving satisfactory predictions of organic matter loss and crop yield responses to amendments. This model was then used to explore the effects of different nutrient resource allocation strategies across farms on field- and farm-scale production and the development of soil fertility gradients. Regular applications of manure to only part of a farm, common on farms with a limited amount, rapidly lead to large gradients in crop yield. However, the first version of the model indicated that spreading manure evenly at a lower rate would give greater whole-farm yields, so it seems illogical for farmers to be concentrating their nutrient resources onto infields. Even within an existing soil fertility gradient, greater total farm yields were obtained by spreading a given amount of fertiliser across the fields than by concentrating this fertiliser onto more fertile fields. However, this result was caused by the failure of the SCAN model to adequately simulate the poor response to fertilisers typically seen in outfields. A second version of the model modified to increase runoff and reduce nutrient availability on soils depleted in carbon gave a more realistic decline in crop yields on fields receiving inadequate nutrient inputs. The results of the second version of the model showed that the optimal allocation strategy is dependent on the existing soil fertility gradient. Fertiliser should only be applied on fields where grain yield is responsive to higher nutrient inputs, and not on infields which are nutrient saturated or on degraded outfields. To improve the relevance of fertiliser and manure recommendations, it is necessary to consider resource limitations and production at the farm scale, and the effects of applying nutrient resources not only on current crop yield, but also on the development of soil fertility on different fields. Simplified dynamic modelling approaches are highly suitable for exploring such questions of resource allocation at farm scale. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Biological nitrogen fixation is the most important biochemical reaction for life on earth. Phosphorus and rhizobium inoculation increased N-2-fixation by legumes. Legumes in rotation with cereals contribute to the total N pool in soil and improved cereals yield. In view of importance of grain legumes and the role they can play in maintaining soil productivity and succeeding cereal yield, rotational field experiments were conducted on mung bean (Vigna radiata) and mash bean (Vigna mungo) during summer of 2002 and 2003 followed by wheat (Triticum aestivum) in each year at Research Farm of University of Arid Agriculture, Rawalpindi, to assess N-2-fixation by beans and their residual effect on subsequent wheat yield. Bean seeds were inoculated at sowing with effective brady rhizobia and grown with and without Phosphorus fertilizer. Sorghum (Var.YSS-98) was sown as non-legume crop with 100kg N ha(-1). Xylem ureide method has been employed for estimation of N-2-fixation. Nodulation, shoot dry matter, grain yield and N concentration of both beans were increased by phosphorus fertilization. Both beans showed excellent nodulations i.e., 4, which showed excellent potential for nitrogen fixation. Estimates of nitrogen derived from atmosphere (%P-fix) ranged from 49-71% during 2(nd) year and up to 60% increase was observed from 1(st) year. Average N-2-fixed ranged between 33-55 kg ha(-1) during both years and mash bean proved better N-2-fixer. Water use efficiency (WUE) based on grain yield were 23-33% higher with phosphorus fertilization. Values of WUE for N-2-fixation ranged between 0.22 and 1.00 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) and declined with declining %P-fix. Total NO3-N was between 56-67 kg ha(-1) for legumes and between 40-45 kg ha(-1) for non-legume sorghum. Additional residual soil N under legumes, relative to adjacent sorghum was in the range of 16-22 kg ha(-1). Beans with phosphorus fertilization increased grain yield of succeeding wheat by 20% over sorghum. It was concluded that phosphorus fertilizer with inoculation enhanced N-2-fixation and rotational results confirmed that legume-cereal sequence increased biomass and grain yield of subsequent wheat.

AB  - Breeding towards root-centric ideotypes can be a relatively quick trait-based strategy to improve crop resource use efficiency. Irrigated agriculture represents a crucial and expanding sector, but its unique parameters require traits distinct from previously proposed rainfed ideotypes. We propose a novel irrigated ideotype that integrates traits across multiple scales to enhance resource use efficiency in irrigated agroecosystems, where resources are concentrated in a relatively shallow 'critical zone'. Unique components of this ideotype include rapid transplant recovery and establishment, enhanced exploitation of localized resource hotspots, adaptive physiological regulation, maintenance of hydraulic conductivity, beneficial rhizosphere interactions, and salinity/waterlogging avoidance. If augmented by future research, this target could help to enhance agricultural sustainability in irrigated agroecosystems by guiding the creation of resource-efficient cultivars.

AB  - We performed ground-penetrating radar measurements to study the internal structure of Puente del Inca (Inca Bridge). This natural structure is located in Mendoza, Argentina, and its formation is associated with deposition of travertine caused by geobiological processes created by hot mineral springs. The 200-MHz ground-penetrating radar measurements performed on the surface of the bridge allowed us to relate the behaviour of the electromagnetic signal with the presence or absence of hot spring activity. We also made ground-penetrating radar measurements at 20 MHz to estimate the propagation velocity and study the bridge's internal structure. In order to validate the ground-penetrating radar results, we used a soil dielectric sensor to obtain the attenuation and the velocity of the medium. The results showed similar propagation velocities (0.0222 m/ns on average) between field observation (ground-penetrating radar) and independent sensor data, as well as significant attenuation due to the hot spring water, which is the primary element controlling the response of the electromagnetic signals. As checked through dielectric sensor measurements, the unusually low electromagnetic wave velocity is due to polarisation mechanisms related to thermal water, which cause a very high permittivity value (178.1). However, the medium is not sufficiently dispersive (conductivity=27.7 mS/m; attenuation=3.5 dB/m) to condition the results of ground-penetrating radar measurements if low-frequency antennas (20 MHz) are used.

AB  - Low levels of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in soils in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) limit maize (Zea mays) production in smallholder farms. We tested the hypothesis that desmodium (Desmodium intortum (Mill.) Urb.), a fodder legume, and food legumes commonly grown with maize in Western Kenya avail N and P and improve the performance of maize in intercrops. We measured available N and P in 15 cm topsoil at 4, 8 and 12 weeks after planting (WAP), and corresponding maize shoot weight in three seasons: 2017 long rains (LR), 2017 short rains (SR), and 2018 LR at Thomas Odhiambo Campus of icipe at Mbita Point in western Kenya. Treatments were additive 1:1 maize-legume intercrops; maize-bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), maize-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.), maize-crotalaria (Crotalaria ochroleuca G. Don), maize-desmodium, maize-green gram [Vigna radiata (L.) Wilczek] and maize-groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and maize monocrop as a control, replicated four times in a complete randomized design. This experiment was established in 2003 and treatments were repeated every season on the same plot (for 31 seasons up to 2018 LR). At the beginning (year 2003), experimental plots were infested with 100 g of striga seeds per 250 g soil. Across the three last seasons corresponding to this study, we observed an increase in available N in maize-desmodium plots compared to maize monocrop plots. Available P measured at 4, 8 and 12 WAP in 2017 SR and at 4 WAP in 2018 LR was higher in maize-desmodium than in maize monocrop at the same sampling times (P < 0.05). The shoot weight for maize grown with desmodium was consistently higher than that for maize grown in monocrop. Maize grain yield for maize-desmodium was 5.0, 3.1 and 4.3 Mg ha-1 in 2017 LR, 2017 SR and 2018 LR, respectively, compared to 0.5, 0.4 and 1.8 Mg ha-1 for maize monocrop in the three respective seasons. Other intercrops were comparable with maize monocrop. Historic maize yields were constantly higher in maize-desmodium than maize monocrop and other maize-legume intercrops. We show that desmodium improves N and P availability, growth and yield of maize. We recommend studies on biological N fixation and changes in rhizosphere to understand mechanisms behind observed improvement in N and P availability.

AB  - Fertilization is the most expensive cultural practice for the increasing numbers of organic vegetable growers in the United States. Nitrogen (N) is the most important and costly nutrient to manage, and cost-effective N management practices are needed for efficient organic vegetable production. There is a wide array of organic N sources available, but they vary in cost, N content, and N availability. Compost and cover crops are commonly used sources of N for vegetables because they are relatively inexpensive and offer additional nutrients or soil improvement qualities in addition to N. Studies have shown that compost quality factors that affect N mineralization vary by source and among different batches from the same source. Compost carbon to N ratio should be equal to or less than 20:1 to assure net short-term mineralization. Cover crops also vary in N content and mineralization rate after incorporation. Leguminous cover crops decompose and release N more rapidly than grass or cereal cover crops at the preheading stage typically incorporated. Even the most efficient N-supplying composts, cover crops, or other organic N sources do not release appreciable N to a subsequent crop beyond 6 to 8 weeks from incorporation, and this burst of early N may not synchronize with N requirements for many vegetable crops. Other potential organic fertilizer N sources have been evaluated for vegetables, and they vary in N cost and N mineralization rate. Materials evaluated include seabird guano, liquid fish, feather meal, corn meal (Zea mays), blood meal, and liquid soybean meal (Glycine max) among others. Of those evaluated, feather meal, seabird guano, and liquid fish stand out as more economical organic sources of available N. Organic sources generally lack uniformity and are bulky, unstable, and inconsistent as a group, and this contributes to additional hidden management costs for organic growers. Liquid organic N sources for use in microirrigation systems may have additional disadvantages caused by loss of valuable nutrient N that is removed by filters.

AB  - A mandatory best management practices (BMP) program was implemented in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA) farms basin-wide in 1995 as required by the Everglades Forever Act to reduce P loads in drainage water reaching the Everglades ecosystem. All firms in the EAA basin implement similar BMPs, and basin wide P load reductions have exceeded the 25% reduction required by law; however, differences remain in water quality between subbasins. Our objective was to determine long-term trends in P loads in discharge water in the EAA after implementing BMPs for 7 to 10 yr and to explore reasons for differences in the performance of the subbasins. Two monitoring datasets were used, one from 10 research firms and the second from the EAA basin inflow and outflow locations. Mann-Kendall trend analysis was used to determine the degree of change in water quality trends. A decreasing trend in P loads was observed in general on sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum L.) firms, while mixed crop firms showed either decreasing or insignificant trends. The insignificant trends are probably related to management practices of mixed crop systems. Decreasing trends in P loads were observed in the outflow of the EAA basin, S5A, and S8 subbasins from 1992 to 2002. Inflow water from Lake Okeechobee had increasing P concentration front 1992 to 2006 with the highest trend in the cast side of the lake. This analysis indicated there may be other factors impacting the success of BMPs in individual farms including cropping rotations and flooding of organic soils. Elevated P concentrations in Lake Okeechobee water used for irrigation may pose a future risk to degrade water quality on farms in the EAA, especially in the S5A subbasin.

AB  - To provide growing population with sufficient food, greenhouse vegetable production has expanded rapidly in recent years in China and sustainability of its farming practices is a major concern. Therefore, this study assessed the sustainability of greenhouse vegetable farming practices from environmental, economic, and socio-institutional perspectives in China based on selected indicators. The empirical data were collected through a survey of 91 farm households from six typical greenhouse vegetable production bases and analysis of environmental material samples. The results showed that heavy fertilization in greenhouse vegetable bases of China resulted in an accumulation of N, P, Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn in soil, nutrient eutrophication in irrigation water, and high Cd in some leaf vegetables cultivated in acidic soil. Economic factors including decreased crop yield in conventional farming bases, limited and site-dependent farmers' income, and lack of complete implementation of subsidy policies contributed a lot to adoption of heavy fertilization by farmers. Also, socio-institutional factors such as lack of unified management of agricultural supplies in the bases operated in cooperative and small family business models and low agricultural extension service efficiency intensified the unreasonable fertilization. The selection of cultivated vegetables was mainly based on farmers' own experience rather than site-dependent soil conditions. Thus, for sustainable development of greenhouse vegetable production systems in China, there are two key aspects. First, it is imperative to reduce environmental pollution and subsequent health risks through integrated nutrient management and the planting strategy of selected low metal accumulation vegetable species especially in acidic soil. Second, a conversion of cooperative and small family business models of greenhouse vegetable bases to enterprises should be extensively advocated in future for the unified agricultural supplies management and improved agricultural extension service efficiency, which in turn can stabilize vegetable yields and increase farmers' benefits.

AB  - Reactive nitrogen (N-r) emission from soils, e.g., nitrous acid (HONO) and nitric oxide (NO), is a key process of the global nitrogen (N) cycle and has significant implications for atmospheric chemistry. To understand the underlying mechanisms of soil N-r emissions, air-dried or oven-dried soils are commonly used in the laboratory. To date, few studies have compared the effects of different drying methods on soil N-r gas fluxes and N fractions. Here, the authors studied soil water content, pH, (in)organic N content, and N-r gas fluxes of air-dried, freeze-dried, oven-dried, and fresh soils from different land-use types. The results showed that the soil pH of air-dried and oven-dried samples was significantly lower compared with fresh soil from farmland and grassland, but higher compared with forest soil. The difference in soil pH between freeze-dried and fresh soil (mean +/- standard deviation: 0.52 +/- 0.31) was the lowest. In general, all drying methods increased the soil NH4+-N, NO3--N, and dissolved organic N contents compared with fresh soil (P < 0.05). The maximum HONO and NO flux and total emissions during a full wetting-drying cycle of fresh soil were also increased by air-drying and oven-drying (P < 0.001), but comparable with freeze-dried soil (P > 0.2). In conclusion, all drying methods should be considered for use in studies on the land-atmosphere interface and biogeochemical N cycling, whereas the freeze-drying method might be better for studies involving the measurement of soil N-r gas fluxes.

AB  - Spatio-temporal variability of soil fertility and cocoa pod borer (CPB) infestation rate provides strategic information about the soil nutrients and CPB population densities at different harvest intervals. This enables the transitioning of cocoa fields (cooca-gliricidia and cocoa-coconut) from conventional to modern precision management. Geostatistical methods were applied to interpolate the data collected from a systematic grid based on a cluster of six cocoa tree stands for both fields and produce maps representing the spatial variability of all soil variables and CPB attack. Cocoa fresh bean weight and CPB infestation data were collected at two week-intervals from cocoa-gliricidia and cocoa-coconut. All field data points were geo-referenced by a differential global positioning system. Data were processed for possible outliers, and analysed by variography and interpolation techniques for quantification of spatial variability. Results showed that both plots exhibited definable spatial structures and were described by exponential models. Precision cocoa management recorded an increase in crop yield by 52.8 and 37.5% at cocoa-gliricidia and cocoa-coconut, respectively. Site-specific nutrient management and integrated pest control in the critical zones showed improvement in cocoa yields, especially during the peak harvest season.

AB  - Rice growth monitoring is very important as rice is one of the staple crops of the world. Rice variables as quantitative indicators of rice growth are critical for farming management and yield estimation, and synthetic aperture radar ( SAR) has great advantages for monitoring rice variables due to its all-weather observation capability. In this study, eight temporal RADARSAT-2 full-polarimetric SAR images were acquired during rice growth cycle and a modified water cloud model ( MWCM) was proposed, in which the heterogeneity of the rice canopy in the horizontal direction and its phenological changes were considered when the double-bounce scattering between the rice canopy and the underlying surface was firstly considered as well. Then, three scattering components from an improved polarimetric decomposition were coupled with the MWCM, instead of the backscattering coefficients. Using a genetic algorithm, eight rice variables were estimated, such as the leaf area index ( LAI), rice height ( h), and the fresh and dry biomass of ears ( F-e and D-e). The accuracy validation showed the MWCM was suitable for the estimation of rice variables during the whole growth season. The validation results showed that the MWCM could predict the temporal behaviors of the rice variables well during the growth cycle ( R-2 > 0.8). Compared with the original water cloud model ( WCM), the relative errors of rice variables with the MWCM were much smaller, especially in the vegetation phase ( approximately 15% smaller). Finally, it was discussed that the MWCM could be used, theoretically, for extensive applications since the empirical coefficients in the MWCM were determined in general cases, but more applications of the MWCM are necessary in future work.

AB  - Little is known about matter flows in intensive small scale production systems of urban agriculture in West Africa as an important criterion to assess their sustainability and environmental externalities. This study therefore investigated nutrient management practices in six selected urban vegetable gardens of Bobo Dioulasso, the second largest city of Burkina Faso. Nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and carbon (C) fluxes were quantified and nutrient balances calculated for three gardens representing typical commercial gardening + field crops and livestock systems (cGCL) and three gardens representing commercial gardening + semi-commercial field crop systems (cGscC). Inputs in all gardens exceeded the amounts recommended by the extension service by up to 709% for N and 434% for K leading to horizontal annual surpluses of 1013 kg N ha(-1), 879 kg K ha(-1), and 25 t C ha(-1), while total balances were only positive for N and K, but negative for C. In both systems, apparent nutrient use efficiency was highest for K (85% and 54% for cGCL and cGscC) followed by N (66% and 44%). Management recommendations should be geared towards increasing N efficiencies by better tailoring nutrient supply to crop demands.

AB  - An innovative algorithm, shuffled complexes with principal components analysis (SP-UCI), is developed to overcome a critical deficiency of the shuffled complex evolution scheme: population degeneration. Population degeneration means that, during the evolutionary search process, the population of search particles may degenerate into a subspace of the full parameter space, thereby missing the capacity of fully exploring the parameter space. Being confined in a subspace may even lead the particle population to converge to nonstationary points, which is a fatal malfunction. To overcome this problem, SP-UCI employs the principal components analysis to detect the occurrence of population degeneration and remedy the adverse effects. The ensemble of calibrations of the Sacramento soil moisture accounting model with the SP-UCI method over the Leaf River basin, Mississippi, retrieves the optimal parameter values with the lowest recorded root-mean-squared error of simulated daily runoff against the observation. Moreover, the result also provides consistent (narrow ranges) model parameter distribution, which results in a better understanding of the model's behavior, given the watershed's hydrologic features.

AB  - Crop yield patterns at the field level in dryland agricultural systems often trace back to the spatial structure of water storage and subsurface flow paths. These lateral flow paths create zones of saturation that promote nutrient loss from runoff and leaching beneath the root zone. Despite its clear importance, a spatially explicit representation of landscape hydrology is frequently missing from site-specific crop and fertilizer management plans. This work uses the grid-based water balance model, SMR (soil moisture routing), to adapt an established method of hydrologic classification, the Budyko framework, for small agricultural watersheds. The model was evaluated with spatially distributed soil moisture data and surface runoff measurements in four annually cropped fields located across the eastern Palouse region of the inland Pacific Northwest. The Budyko framework, modified to include change in root zone water storage and lateral flow, was combined with a separate indicator of yield potential to form a dual-threshold classification scheme for variable-rate fertilizer management that balances agronomic benefit with environmental impact. Each field was divided into zones based on crop yield and nitrogen loss potentials, which link to the hydrologic functioning of the landscape through soil water storage and subsurface redistribution, respectively. Results showed large variability in the annual water balance assessed within individual fields and between fields. The greatest variability was observed in the two eastern-most fields where the wettest zone of each had water supply 172% and 137% that of the dry zone. Depth to a hydraulic restrictive layer and topography were identified as primary landscape controls on the water supply (precipitation plus net lateral flow minus change in water storage) in these fields. Moreover, the steep climate gradient in the region created field-to-field variability in water balance with the ratio of evapotranspiration to precipitation ranging from 91% in the western-most field to approximately 70% in each of the fields to the east. The clearest choice is for growers to apply more fertilizer in areas with high water storage capacity and high crop yield and where fertilizer loss through leaching and runoff is minimal. Less fertilizer should be applied in areas with low water storage capacity that frequently saturate. Areas with high storage capacity and frequent saturation involve a tradeoff between yields and minimizing fertilizer loss that may be best served by splitting fertilizer application to avoid excessive over-winter leaching losses. Even though remote sensing and variable-rate applicators are at the frontiers of precision agriculture, landscape hydrology underlies all dryland crop production and should accordingly be looked to for inspiration in the design of cropping systems.

AB  - In basement catchments of subhumid West Africa, base flow is the main component of annual streamflow. However, the important heterogeneity of lithology hinders the understanding of base flow generation processes. Since these processes are linked with water storage changes (WSCs) across the catchment, we propose the use of hybrid gravity data in addition to neutron probe-derived water content and water levels to monitor spatiotemporal WSC of a typical crystalline basement headwater catchment (16 ha) in Benin. WSC behaviors are shown to provide insights into hydrological processes in terms of water redistribution toward the catchment outlet. Hybrid gravimetry produces gravity change observations from time-lapse microgravity surveys coupled with gravity changes monitored at a base station using a superconducting gravimeter and/or an absolute gravimeter. A dense microgravity campaign (70 surveys of 14 stations) covering three contrasted years was set up with a rigorous protocol, leading to low uncertainties (< 2.5 mu Gal) on station gravity determinations (with respect to the network reference station). Empirical orthogonal function analyses of both gravity changes and WSCs from neutron probe data show similar spatial patterns in the seasonal signal. Areas where storage and water table show a capping behavior (when data reach a plateau during the wet season), suggesting threshold-governed fast subsurface redistribution, are identified. This observed storage dynamics, together with geological structures investigated by electrical resistivity tomography and drill log analysis, make it possible to derive a conceptual model for the catchment hydrology.

AB  - In the Cerrado region of Brazil conventional soybean monoculture is since the 1980s being replaced by direct seeding mulch-based cropping (DMC) with two crops per year and absence of tillage practices. The objective of this study was to assess the long-term impact of DMC on soil organic matter accumulation and nitrogen (N) mineralization. Measurements of soil organic carbon (C) content, soil total N content and soil N mineralization, both under laboratory conditions using disturbed soil samples and under field conditions using intact soil cores were conducted on a chronosequence of 2-, 6-, 9- and 14-year-old DMC fields (DMC-2, DMC-6, DMC-9 and DMC-14, respectively). The average increase of organic C in the 0-30 cm topsoil layer under DMC was 1.91 Mg C ha(-1) year(-1). Soil total N increased with 103 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) (0-30 cm). The potential N mineralization rate under laboratory conditions (28 degrees C, 75% of soil moisture at field capacity) was 0.27, 0.28, 0.39 and 0.36 mg N kg soil(-1) stop day(-1) for, respectively, the DMC-2, DMC-6, DMC-9 and DMC-14 soils. The corresponding specific N mineralization rates were 0.16, 0.15, 0.22 and 0.17 mg N g Npt(-1) day(-1). There was no obvious explanation for the higher specific N mineralization rate of soils under DMC-9, given the similar soil conditions and land-use history before DMC was introduced. Results from the in situ N incubation experiments were in good agreement with those from the laboratory incubations. We estimated that soil N mineralization increases with about 2.0 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) under DMC. The increase was mainly attributed to the larger soil total N content. These results indicate that even in the medium term (10 years), continuous DMC cropping has limited implications for N fertilization recommendations, since the extra soil N supply represents less than 20% of the common N fertilization dose for maize in the region.

AB  - Intensive irrigation coupled with excessive nitrogen (N) fertilizer input has resulted in high soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in vegetable cropping systems. Biochar as a soil amendment has been advocated as a desirable option to reduce GHG emissions in agricultural systems, but its interactive effects with soil N availability in vegetable systems have yet to be clarified. We performed a field study to examine how biochar interacts with N fertilizer in driving annual methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from an intensively-irrigated greenhouse vegetable cropping system acting as both sources of atmospheric CH4 and N2O in subtropical China. Biochar amendment significantly increased soil CH4 emissions by 33% and 85%, while it decreased soil N2O emissions by 22% and 12% with and without N fertilizer input, respectively. Fertilizer N combination weakened the positive response of CH4 to biochar while it enhanced the mitigation potential of biochar for N2O. Annual direct emission factors of fertilizer N for N2O were estimated to be 1.35% and 1.94% for the fields with and without biochar amendment, respectively. Annual flux-sustained global warming potential (SGWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) were significantly decreased by biochar amendment, and this mitigation effect was enhanced with fertilizer N combination. Altogether, we highlight that biochar can reconcile higher yield and lower climatic impact in intensive vegetable cropping systems in subtropical China, particularly in vegetable soils with high N availability.

AB  - Variational methods are widely used for the analysis and control of computationally intensive spatially distributed systems. In particular, the adjoint state method enables a very efficient calculation of the derivatives of an objective function (response function to be analysed or cost function to be optimised) with respect to model inputs.
   In this contribution, it is shown that the potential of variational methods for distributed catchment scale hydrology should be considered. A distributed flash flood model, coupling kinematic wave overland flow and Green Ampt infiltration, is applied to a small catchment of the Thore basin and used as a relatively simple (synthetic observations) but didactic application case.
   It is shown that forward and adjoint sensitivity analysis provide a local but extensive insight on the relation between the assigned model parameters and the simulated hydrological response. Spatially distributed parameter sensitivities can be obtained for a very modest calculation effort (similar to 6 times the computing time of a single model run) and the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the Jacobian matrix provides an interesting perspective for the analysis of the rainfall-runoff relation.
   For the estimation of model parameters, adjoint-based derivatives were found exceedingly efficient in driving a bound-constrained quasi-Newton algorithm. The reference parameter set is retrieved independently from the optimization initial condition when the very common dimension reduction strategy (i.e. scalar multipliers) is adopted.
   Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis results suggest that most of the variability in this high-dimensional parameter space can be captured with a few orthogonal directions. A parametrization based on the SVD leading singular vectors was found very promising but should be combined with another regularization strategy in order to prevent overfitting.

AB  - Increasing irrigation water scarcity is threatening global rice production and sustainability. Accordingly, the cultivation of drought-resistant rice varieties has been strongly advocated to reduce the consumption of irrigation water. However, it remains unclear how the cultivation of drought-resistant rice affects greenhouse gas emissions. Here, a two-year field experiment was conducted to elucidate the effects of irrigation regimes (AWD, alternate wetting and drying; CF, continuous flooding) and rice varieties (drought-resistant rice 7Y88 and 7Y370, and conventional rice HHZ) on the grain yields and greenhouse gas (methane [CH4] and nitrous oxide [N2O]) emissions from paddy fields. The experiment was performed in a split-plot design with three replications. The results showed that AWD significantly reduced water inputs and grain yields compared with CF in both rice growing seasons. On average, 7Y88 and 7Y370 significantly enhanced the water use efficiency by 37.6% and 51.5%, and the grain yields by 33.9% and 47.0% relative to HHZ, respectively. A trade-off between CH4 and N2O emissions was observed under irrigation regimes. Compared with CF, AWD significantly reduced cumulative CH4 emissions by 64.9%, while increased cumulative N2O emissions by 160.0%, and decreased the grain yield by 11.6% on average. AWD also significantly reduced the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) by 42.2% and 31.6%, respectively. Significant differences (p < 0.05) in GHG emissions, GWP and GHGI were observed between drought-resistant rice varieties and HHZ. The rice variety 7Y370 resulted in the lowest CH4 and N2O emissions, GWP and GHGI among all varieties under both irrigation regimes. These results indicate that the rice variety 7Y370 can be recommended to simultaneously mitigate GWP and maintain grain yields.

AB  - Seedling blight has a substantial impact on stand establishment and productivity of canola (Brassica napus) on the Canadian prairies. The effects of seeding date, seed size, seeding depth, and seed treatment fungicides on seedling blight of canola caused by Fusarium avenaceum and Pythium ultimum were evaluated under field conditions. In the trials inoculated with P. ultimum, early seeding reduced seedling emergence and seed yield in all 3 yr of the study. However, the interaction of F. avenaceum with seeding date was not consistent; inoculation with F. avenaceum reduced seedling emergence in early seeded canola in 1 of 4 yr, but emergence was higher in early than in mid-seeded treatments in 2 yr and there was no difference among seeding dates in 1 yr. Late seeding reduced seed yield in 2 of 4 yr in the F. avenaceum study. Seed size and seeding depth generally did not have an effect on seedling establishment or seed yield for either pathogen. Seed treatment with Helix Xtra (thiamethoxam + difenconazole + metalaxyl + fludioxonil) and Prosper FX (clothianidin + carboxin + trifloxystrobin + metalaxyl) fungicides increased seedling emergence and yield compared with the F. avenaceum-inoculated control. Seed treatment with Helix Xtra also increased seedling emergence and seed yield compared with the P. ultimum-inoculated control. Manipulation of seeding date did not substantially improve stand establishment or yield of canola when inoculum pressure was high. Seed treatment was the most effective strategy for reducing losses caused by seedling blight of canola in fields infested with F. avenaceum or P. ultimum.

AB  - Robustness in lettuce, defined as the ability to produce stable yields across a wide range of environments, may be associated with below-ground traits such as water and nitrate capture. In lettuce, research on the role of root traits in resource acquisition has been rather limited. Exploring genetic variation for such traits and shoot performance in lettuce across environments can contribute to breeding for robustness. A population of 142 lettuce cultivars was evaluated during two seasons (spring and summer) in two different locations under organic cropping conditions, and water and nitrate capture below-ground and accumulation in the shoots were assessed at two sampling dates. Resource capture in each soil layer was measured using a volumetric method based on fresh and dry weight difference in the soil for soil moisture, and using an ion-specific electrode for nitrate. We used these results to carry out an association mapping study based on 1170 single nucleotide polymorphism markers. We demonstrated that our indirect, high-throughput phenotyping methodology was reliable and capable of quantifying genetic variation in resource capture. QTLs for below-ground traits were not detected at early sampling. Significant marker-trait associations were detected across trials for below-ground and shoot traits, in number and position varying with trial, highlighting the importance of the growing environment on the expression of the traits measured. The difficulty of identifying general patterns in the expression of the QTLs for below-ground traits across different environments calls for a more in-depth analysis of the physiological mechanisms at root level allowing sustained shoot growth.

Plant Sci. 92: 627-650. A weed seedling recruitment microsite is the location of a weed seed in the soil profile which affects germination, time of emergence and seedling establishment. The relationship between the recruitment of seedlings and their physical environment, including microclimate, soil, topography, and residue cover can provide the key to understanding the timing of seedling recruitment. The variability that exists in germination and establishment requirements within and among weed species raises important questions for recruitment research addressing multiple species, as well as regional models of genetic variability within species. Current weed recruitment research focuses mainly on summer annual species in annual cropping systems. However, with changes in cropping systems, climate, and weed biology, there will be an increasing demand for the management of both summer and winter annual weeds that develop very early in the spring. Many studies to date take an average of microsite conditions, particularly for soil depth, to describe the seedling recruitment zone. Whereas this practice of under-sampling expedites lengthy and difficult soil environmental measurements, it limits the description of the microsite for predictive purposes. Because soil disturbance disperses seeds to microsites throughout the vertical profile of the shallow seedling recruitment zone, seeds are subjected to gradients of temperature and water that create diverse microsites with depth in the recruitment zone. Research on the interactions of microclimate, field topography, soil properties and agronomic practices can further our knowledge base of the seedling recruitment microsite to better understand weed ecology and population dynamics generally, as well as enhance our ability to predict seedling recruitment specifically.

AB  - Black wattle is a tree native to Australia and commercially planted in South Africa and Brazil. Replacement of exported nutrients by wood and bark harvesting, associated with the maintenance of harvest residues, increases productivity, thus maintaining production sustainability. Here, we review recent advances in soil nutrient dynamics, harvest residue management (HRM), and soil organic matter in black wattle plantations. Over the 7-11-year cycle of black wattle, N is the most exported macronutrient (458-1509 kg ha- 1), followed by K (200-766 kg ha(- 1)), Ca (270-717 kg ha(- 1)), Mg (62-128 kg ha(- 1)), S (29-57 kg ha(- 1)) and P (16-40 kg ha(- 1)). The average increase in bark yield to 20 kg P ha- 1 applications on sandy soils was 2.7-2.9 t ha- 1 and on clay soils from 2.8 to 8.7 t ha(- 1). Sandy soils with low K are more responsive to fertilizer, and rates must consider the K content and cation exchange capacity. Ca and Mg addition responses are more likely when in the topsoil they are in low concentrations (< 0.75 and 0.41 cmolc dm(- 3), respectively). Micronutrient fertilization reduces the occurrence of gummosis caused by Phytophthora spp, and B deficiency is the most common and can be supplied by fertilization or foliar application (1 g B L- 1). Few studies have evaluated the impact of black wattle HRM on soil organic matter (SOM) and its effects on production. However, conserving SOM should be considered an essential practice for the sustainability of black wattle production.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the cumulative hydrologic performance of green infrastructure in a residential area of the city of Parma, Ohio, draining to a tributary of the Cuyahoga River. Green infrastructure included the following spatially distributed devices: 16 street-side bioretention cells, 7 rain gardens, and 37 rain barrels. Data consisted of rainfall and outfall flow records for a wide range of storm events, including pretreatment and treatment periods. The Stormwater Management Model was calibrated and validated to predict the hydrologic response of green infrastructure. The calibrated model was used to quantify annual water budget alterations and discharge frequency over a 6 year simulation period. For the study catchment, we observed a treatment effect with increases of 1.4% in evaporation, 7.6% in infiltration, and a 9.0% reduction in surface runoff. The hydrologic performance of green infrastructure was evaluated by comparing the flow duration curve for pretreatment and treatment outfall flow scenarios. The flow duration curve shifted downward for the green infrastructure scenario. Discharges with a 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 year return period were reduced by an average of 29%. Parameter and predictive uncertainties were inspected by implementing a Bayesian statistical approach.

AB  - Study region: This study used data collected from three cropland sites (two in Manitoba and one in Prince Edward Island) in Canada.
   Study focus: In efforts to accurately describe the water dynamics in agricultural soils, most of the agri-hydrological models developed are highly complex, such that they require detailed input data, of which most of them are not always measured or otherwise readily available. However, the comprehensive and complex representations of the processes may not be justified when data is scarce. Thus, this study developed a soil water budget model that could describe the movement of water through Canadian agricultural soils using a few parameters only. The model was developed by selecting algorithms from various existing models, whose data requirements are readily available in literature and public Canadian databases.
   New hydrological insights: The model developed in this study can simulate evapotranspiration, runoff, deep percolation, and soil moisture content for various seasons (i.e., growing, nongrowing/dormant, and pre-planting/post-harvest) with minimum data requirement, which addresses the limited availability of data in the country for crop and hydrological modeling. Moreover, the model is simple and easy to use, and can work without calibration. It was tested using three site-specific datasets, and results show that despite its simplicity, its overall performance was comparable with those of other agricultural models that use cascade flow framework for hydrology.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) loss from agriculture impacts ecosystems worldwide. One strategy to mitigate these losses, ecologically based nutrient management (ENM), seeks to recouple carbon (C) and N cycles to reduce environmental losses and supply N to cash crops. However, our capacity to apply ENM is limited by a lack of field-based high-resolution data on N dynamics in actual production contexts. We used data from a five-year study of organic cropping systems to investigate soil inorganic N (SIN) variability and nitrate (NO3-) leaching in ENM. Four production systems initiated in 2007 and 2008 in central Pennsylvania varied in crop rotation, timing and intensity of tillage, inclusion of fallow periods, and N inputs. Extractable SIN was measured fortnightly from March through November throughout the experiment, and NO3-N concentration below the rooting zone was sampled with lysimeters during the first year of the 2008 start. We used recursive partitioning models to assess the importance of management and environmental factors to SIN variability and NO3- leaching and identify interactions between influential variables. Air temperature and tillage were the most important drivers of SIN across systems. The highest SIN concentrations occurred when the average air temperature three weeks prior to measurement was above 21 degrees C. Above this temperature and within 109 days of moldboard plowing, average SIN concentrations were 22.1 mg N/kg soil; 109 days or more past plowing average SIN dropped to 7.7 mg N/kg soil. Other drivers of SIN dynamics were N available from manure and cover crops. Highest average leachate NO3-N concentrations (15.2 ppm) occurred in fall and winter when SIN was above 4.9 mg/kg six weeks prior to leachate collection. Late season tillage operations leading to elevated SIN and leachate NO3-N concentrations were a strategy to reduce weeds while meeting consumer demand for organic products. Thus, while tillage that incorporates organic N inputs preceding cash crops can promote synchrony of N mineralization and crop demand, late or post-season tillage promotes NO3- leaching by stimulating SIN pulses that are asynchronous With plant uptake.

AB  - The sustainability of agriculture in the Mediterranean climate is challenged by high irrigation water demands and ni-trogen fertilizer losses to the environment, causing significant pressure on groundwater resources and groundwater-dependent ecosystems. Advanced irrigation technologies and improved fertilizer management have been promoted as key solutions to reduce the agricultural impact on aquatic systems. However, it remains unclear how different irrigation-fertilizer practices perform on the long-term under a highly variable climate, such as the Mediterranean one. Here, we conduct hydrological simulations over a fifty-year period to quantify the magnitude and dynamics of groundwater recharge and nitrogen leaching under five real-case irrigation-fertilizer practices observed in Valencia (eastern Spain). The Valencian Region is the largest citrus-producing region of Europe and current irrigation-fertilizer practices reflect the ongoing transformation of irrigation systems from flood to drip irrigation. Our simula-tions highlight three major implications of the irrigation transformation for groundwater resources. First, the transfor-mation from flood to drip irrigation reduces the recharge fraction (19% vs. 16%) and especially the nitrogen leaching fraction (33% vs. 18%) on the long term. Second, the long-term performance of the two irrigation practices is subject to substantial inter-annual differences controlled by precipitation variability. The sensitivity of recharge and nitrogen leaching to annual meteorological conditions is stronger in drip irrigation, which eventually leads to a similar performance of flood and drip irrigation in wet years if fertilizer inputs are similar. Third, we identify a pronounced year-to-year nitrogen memory in the soil, whereby an enhanced (decreased) nitrogen leaching is observed after anom- alously dry (wet) years, affecting the performance of irrigation-fertilizer practices. Overall, the study demonstrates the highly variable nature of the performance of irrigation-fertilizer practices, and the major findings can guide future efforts in designing sustainable water management strategies for agricultural areas with a Mediterranean climate.

AB  - The local land-atmosphere coupling (LoCo) over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) in the rainy season and the possible influence of the South Asian monsoon (SAM) on LoCo characteristics are investigated by applying two LoCo diagnostic metrics to 12-year observational data at six stations over the TP and the ERA5 from June to September (JJAS) from 1980 to 2018. The validation of ERA5 in estimating monthly mean diurnal evolutions of T-2m, q(2m), and surface fluxes (H-sfc and LEsfc) at the six stations reveals that these variables in the ERA5 are relatively reliable for the LoCo analysis. The mixing diagram analysis based on the observational data and ERA5 suggests that the monthly variations in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) energy budget are strong and vary from station to station, revealing the complexity of the influence of the SAM on the PBL energy budget over TP. The relationship between H-sfc and PBL height (PBLH) and lifted condensation level (LCL) deficit at the six stations based on the ERA5 reveal a strong influence of soil moisture on PBL growth and convective cloud formation, although the topography may also exert its influence. Analyses of the correlations of the PBL energy budget, PBLH, and LCL deficit over the TP with the SAM in JJAS indicate that the LoCo characteristics over the TP show large spatial variability between the southeastern and central-western parts of the TP. Such spatial variability can be attributed to the spatial differences in monthly mean soil moisture and rainfall closely related to the evolution of SAM's influence and the complex topography of the TP. The topography of the TP can also affect the LoCo characteristics in JJAS, but the mechanisms in the areas dominated by SAM and by the westerly winds are different.

AB  - Water shortage is a serious issue threatening the sustainable development of agriculture in the North China Plain, with the winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) as its largest water-consuming crop. The effects of tillage practices on the water consumption and water use efficiency (WUE) of wheat under high-yield conditions using supplemental irrigation based on testing soil moisture dynamic change were examined in this study. This experiment was conducted from 2007 to 2010, with five tillage practice treatments, namely, strip rotary tillage (SR), strip rotary tillage after subsoiling (SRS), rotary tillage (R), rotary tillage after subsoiling (RS), and plowing tillage (P). The results showed that in the SRS and RS treatments the total water and soil water consumptions were 11.81, 25.18% and 12.16, 14.75% higher than those in SR and R treatments, respectively. The lowest ratio of irrigation consumption to total water consumption in the SRS treatment was 18.53 and 21.88% for the 2008-2009 and 2009-2010 growing seasons, respectively. However, the highest percentage of water consumption was found in the SRS treatment from anthesis to maturity. No significant difference was found between the WUE of the flag leaf at the later filling stage in the SRS and RS treatments, but the flag leaf WUE at these stages were higher than those of other treatments. The SRS and RS treatments exhibited the highest grain yield (9573.76 and 9507.49 kg ha(-1) for 3-yr average) with no significant difference between the two treatments, followed by P, R and SR treatments. But the SRS treatment had the highest WUE. Thus, the 1-yr subsoiling tillage, plus 2 yr of strip rotary planting operation may be an efficient measure to increase wheat yield and WUE.

AB  - Empirical modeling helps understand decay processes. The objective of this research was to find a suitable model, and then use it to describe decay of thatch from hybrid bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pets. x Cynodon transvaalensis Burtt-Davy). The carbon dioxide-carbon released from 'Tifdwarf' and 'Tifeagle', each 24 h over 20 cl, was plotted as percent C remaining vs. time. Four empirical models were fit to these data to determine which one best minimized residual sum of squares. The model best meeting this condition was the four-parameter double exponential model. Of the models tested, it was the only one to pass all tests for normally distributed population, constant variance, and independence of residuals. Fitting this model to percent C remaining data identified two C pools for each cultivar, a fast pool and a slow pool, with differing sizes and rate constants. Fast-pool turnover times were similar. Slow-pool turnover times differed, with Tifdwarf decaying faster than Tifeagle, which may have been a function of Tifeagle having a higher stolon mass with more lignin and a wider C:N. When data were corrected for microbial growth efficiency, slow-pool turnover times decreased. This implied cultural practices that increase microbial growth efficiency may help convert slow pool into biomass, reduce slow-pool turnover times, and ultimately enhance the decay of thatch.

AB  - Increasing phosphorus (P) fertiliser use efficiency (PUE) is essential for addressing global nutrition security, food production costs, and environmental pollution. However, a myriad of soil x climate x crop x management interactions control PUE and adaptive tools are needed to put this complexity into context at the field scale. We conducted a Morris global sensitivity analysis on an evaluated agricultural system model (APSIM) across 132 years of climate data to identify important drivers of PUE in a subtropical dryland cropping system. We selected soil, crop, and management parameters to understand their influence on yield, biomass, and grain P export as measures of PUE in a subtropical wheat crop. We then examined three P fertility scenarios ranging from low to high (10, 40, 70 mg available P kg(-1) at 0-10 cm, with subsoils to 180 cm at 9-10 mg available P kg(-1)) resulting in 1,782,000 simulations. In scenarios with medium or high P fertility and higher in-crop rainfall (> 200 mm), nitrogen (N) fertiliser was the most important driver for increasing yield and associated PUE. At low P fertility and lower in-crop rainfall (< 200 mm), P fertiliser and P sorption isotherm parameters were the most important drivers. This highlighted potential constraints to PUE analysis in the region if rainfall data is not available, and to modelling activities if P isotherm data is not available. Our study is the first to use a Morris global sensitivity analysis method for defining the influence of N and P fertiliser, and in-crop rainfall, as short-term (year-year) drivers of PUE. This method may be adapted to investigate emerging challenges in increasing PUE in other agricultural systems, but future research should include interactions with deep P banding, the effects of climate change, and demonstrate drivers over the longer-term (5-10 years).

The effects of two biannual rotations of canola (Brassica napus L.) durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.) and bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.)-durum wheat and four incorporation rates (0%, 50%, 100%, and 200%) of residues of each preceding crop were evaluated after four seasons on durum wheat production and on its nutritional composition and nutrient extraction, in a volcanic soil in south-central Chile. Results indicated that the highest grain yield and residue production of durum wheat was obtained after bean (7.40 and 7.92 Mg ha(-1), respectively). In the grain were obtained lower N and P concentrations after bean, and higher K, Ca, and Mg concentrations in the residue. The extraction of most durum wheat grain and residue nutrients was higher after bean. Nutrient distribution in the durum wheat plant concentrated in the grain was 79.9 to 80.7% N, 91.3 to 92.1% P, 27.1 to 27.4% K, 16.8 to 18.8% Ca, 68.3 to 70.4% Mg, and 56.3 to 57.4% S. In the residue, nutrient distribution was 19.3 to 20.4% N, 7.9 to 8.7% P, 72.6 to 72.9% K, 81.2 to 83.2%, Ca, 29.6 to 31.7% Mg, and 42.6 to 43.7% S. The highest grain and residue production of durum wheat was obtained after bean crop and also the extraction of most nutrients.

AB  - Improving the assessment and prediction of soil organic nitrogen (N) mineralization is essential: it contributes significantly to the N nutrition of crops and remains a major economic and environmental challenge. Consequently, a network of 137 fields was established in Brittany, France, to represent the wide diversity of soils and cultivation practices in this region. The experimental design was developed to measure net N mineralization for three consecutive years, in order to improve the accuracy of measuring it. Net N mineralization was quantified by the mineral N mass balance, which was estimated from March to October for a maize crop with no N fertilization. The effect of climate on mineralization was considered by calculating normalized time (ndays) and, then, calculating the N mineralization rate (Vn) as the ratio of the mineral N mass balance to normalized time. Strict screening of the experimental data, using agronomic and statistical criteria, resulted in the selection of a subset of 67 fields for data analysis. Mean Vn was relatively high (0.99 kg N ha-1 nday-1) over the period and varied greatly, from 0.62 to 1.46 kg N ha-1 nday-1 for the 10th and 90th percentiles, respectively. The upper soil layer (0-30 cm) was sampled to estimate its physical and chemical properties, particulate organic matter carbon and N fractions (POM-C and POM-N, respectively), soil microbial biomass (SMB), and extractable organic N (EON) determined in a phosphate borate extractant. The strongest correlations between Vn and these variables were observed with EON (r = 0.47), SMB (r = 0.45), POM-N (r = 0.43), and, to a lesser extent, the soil N stock (r = 0.31). Vn was also strongly correlated with a cropping system indicator (r = 0.39). A modeling approach, using generalized additive models, was used to identify and rank the variables with the greatest ability to predict net N mineralization.

AB  - Most subsurface flow treatment wetlands, also known as reed bed or root zone systems, use sand or gravel substrates to reduce organics, solids, and nutrients in septic tank effluents. Phosphorus (P) retention in these systems is highly variable and few studies have identified the fate of retained P. In this study, two substrates, expanded shale and masonry sand, were used as filter media in five subsurface flow pilot-scale wetlands (2.7 m(3)). After 1 year of operation, we estimated the annual rate of P sorption by taking the difference between total P (TP) of substrate in the pilot cells and TP of substrate not exposed to wastewater (control). Means and standard deviations of TP retained by expanded shale were 349 +/- 171 mg kg(-1), respectively. For a substrate depth of 0.9 m, aerial P retention by shale was 201 +/- 98.6 g of P m(-2) year(-1), respectively. Masonry sand retained an insignificant quantity of wastewater P (111.9 +/- 21.8 mg kg(-1)) and on occasion exported P. Substrate samples were also sequentially fractionated into labile P, microbial P, (Fe + Al) P, humic P, (Ca + Mg) P, and residual P. In expanded shale samples, the greatest increase in P was in the relatively permanent form of (Fe + Al) P (108 mg kg(-1)), followed by labile P (46.7 mg kg(-1)) and humic P (39.8 mg kg(-1)). In masonry sand, there was an increase in labile P (9.71 mg kg(-1)). Results suggest that sand is a poor candidate for long-term P storage, but its efficiency is similar to that reported for many sand, gravel, and rock systems. By contrast, expanded shale and similar products with high hydraulic conductivity and P sorption capacity could greatly improve performance of P retention in constructed wetlands.

AB  - Weeds are a major constraint for organic crop production. Previous research has found that cover crops in reduced tillage systems can provide weed interference, subsequently reducing inputs and improving crop yield. However, questions remain about effects of cover crop species identity and cover crop biomass on weed suppression and crop yield. This four-year study investigated how winter cover crops grown alone or in mixture influenced weed presence and crop yield in a reduced tillage organic vegetable system. Treatments were barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), mixed barley + crimson clover, and a no-cover crop control. Plots were flail-mowed and strip-tilled prior to planting main crops (2011 and 2012: broccoli Brassica oleracea L.; 2013 and 2014: crookneck squash Cucurbita pepo L.). We measured density, diversity, and community composition of weeds and viable weed seeds, changes in weed percent cover within growing seasons, and crop yield. We found that the presence of barley, crimson clover, or barley + crimson clover reduced weed density by 50% relative to the control. Cover crop biomass negatively influenced weed density and weed seed diversity, and positively influenced squash yield. Weed percent cover within growing seasons did not respond differentially to cover crop treatment. Cover crop treatment and cover crop biomass had no influence on weed or weed seed community composition. These results suggest that reduced tillage winter cover crops in mixture or monoculture can similarly suppress weeds and improve yield, primarily due to biomass effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

   This research investigated the effects of previous crop covers and nitrogen (N) fertilization level on yield and yield components of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars during two growing seasons (2001-2002 and 20022003) in Turkey under rain-fed Mediterranean conditions. We assessed the effects on seed yield and yield component of: (i) the previous crops, (ii) wheat cultivars, and (iii) nitrogen fertilizer levels. A split-split plot design with three replications was used in this study. Previous crops, alfalfa (Medicago saliva L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), were the main the plots; wheat cultivars (Golia and Pchlivan) were the sub-plots; and five different levels of nitrogen fertilization (0, 50, 100, 150 and 200 kg ha(-1)) were the sub-sub-plots. Even with different N fertilization levels, the seed yield of wheat after sunflower was less than the yield of wheat after alfalfa both in individual years and averaged across years. Seed yields and all yield components for Pehlivan tended to be greater than those of Golia in individual years and over both years. The optimum N application rate for wheat yields in our study was 150 kg N ha(-1) In the dry year of 2002-2003, the reduction in wheat seed yield following all previous crops was accompanied by seed per plant, seed weight per plant and number of plant per square meter.

AB  - Improvement of nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) via active optical sensors has gained attention in recent decades, with the focus of optimizing nitrogen (N) input while simultaneously sustaining crop yields. To the authors' knowledge, a comprehensive review of the literature on how optical sensors have impacted winter wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) NUE and grain yield has not yet been performed. This work reviewed and documented the extent to which the use of optical sensors has impacted winter wheat NUE and yield. Two N management approaches were evaluated; optical sensor and conventional methods. The study included 26 peer-reviewed articles with data on NUE and grain yield. In articles without NUE values but in which grain N was included, the difference method was employed to compute NUE based on grain N uptake. Using optical sensors resulted in an average NUE of 42% (+/- 2.8% standard error). This approach improved NUE by approximately 10.4% (+/- 2.3%) when compared to the conventional method. Grain yield was similar for both approaches of N management. Optical sensors could save as much as 53 (+/- 16) kg N ha(-1). This gain alone may not be adequate for increased adoption, and further refinement of the optical sensor robustness, possibly by including weather variables alongside sound agronomic management practices, may be necessary.

AB  - The Pampa's rangeland in South America is underused or replaced by annual crops or forest cultivation with higher economic returns. Our goal was to test the long term effects of phosphorus fertilizer and limestone applications on P availability, aluminum neutralization in deep soil layer and rangeland productivity. For this, three rates of three phosphorus sources combined with limestone were applied in a 21 year field trial. The dry matter (between 2016 and 2019) and nutrient accumulation in plant shoot were measured. The topsoil was divided in four layers (0-2.5, 2.5-5.0, 5.0-7.5, and 7.5-10.0 cm), and chemical properties were determined. Rock phosphate application at rate 249 kg ha(-1) of P increased the soil P content along the soil profile down to 7.5 cm. After 21 years of liming, the neutralizing front reached depths greater than 10 cm and the reacidification was not significant. In these conditions, the contents of exchangeable Ca, Mg and Al and pH are greater than, and Al saturation is lower than without limestone. The effect of fertilization and limestone amendments are however limited in time and there was no response of rangeland dry matter production after more than four years after the last fertilization.

AB  - Two laboratory experiments consisting of drainage/imbibition and rainfall were carried out to study flow in variably saturated porous media and to test the ability of a new measurement method. 2D maps of water content are obtained through a non-invasive image analysis method based on photographs. This method requires classical image analysis steps, i.e., normalization, filtering, background subtraction, scaling and calibration. The procedure was applied and validated for a large experimental tank of internal dimensions 180 cm long, 120 cm wide and 4 cm deep that had been homogenously packed with monodisperse quartz sand. The calibration curve relating water content and reflected light intensities was established during the main monitoring phase of each experiment, making this procedure very advantageous. Direct measurements carried out during the water flow experiments correspond to water content, pressure head, temperature, and cumulative outflow. Additionally, a great advantage of the proposed method is that it does not require any tracer or dye to be injected into the flow tank. The accuracy and other benefits of our approach were also assessed using numerical simulations with state-of-the-art computational code that solves Richards' equation.

AB  - Two field experiments were conducted at the Research Farm of ICAR-Indian Institute of Water Management, Mendhasal, Odisha with wet season rice. The objective of the first experiment was to compare the effect of inorganic fertilizers (IF) with the integrated nutrient management (INM) using in situ green manure Sesbania and complimentary dose of IF on rice yield, energy use, economics and residual soil fertility. In the second experiment, the IF was compared with the organic nutrient management (ONM) using in situ green manure Sesbania and vermicompost. The results of the first experiment revealed that grain and straw yields of rice were similar with the INM and IF. However, the INM helped in reducing energy input (24%), improving energy efficiency (35%) and net return (20%). Soil organic C, available N and P contents increased significantly by 14%, 8% and 53%, respectively, for the INM at the end of 3 years. The results of the second experiment revealed that the ONM registered rice grain yield reduction by 8% but increased net return (8%) due to a higher premium of INR 1750 (US $ 26.21) t(-1) paddy grain. The ONM treatment reduced energy input (39%) and enhanced energy efficiency (57%) as compared to the IF. Soil organic C, available N and P contents increased by 23%, 39% and 12%, respectively, for the ONM at the end of 3 years. Thus, the practice of ONM or INM using Sesbania green manure-cum-cover crop saved energy and fertilizer, and maintained soil fertility.

AB  - Crops grown in the first or second year after Medicago sativa L. (lucerne or alfalfa) in southern Australia have sometimes yielded less than crops grown after Trifolium subterraneum L. (subterranean clover), despite the greater annual accumulation of legume nitrogen (N) and enhanced N-2 fixation in lucerne-based pastures. To understand why, we studied the N mineralisation patterns of root residues collected from 16- or 20-week-old plants using incubation assays, in two separate experiments with contrasting soil types (a red loam and a grey clay loam). Fine roots of both species added to soil produced more mineral N than the control soil with no root residues added. In contrast, less mineral N accumulated in the presence of coarse roots than in the control soil. These patterns were not explained by differences in physical size or surface-area, but appeared to be more related to the carbon to nitrogen ratio (C:N) of fine and coarse roots. Fine roots of both species had a C:N of about 11, while the C:N of coarse roots ranged from 28 to 37. Subterranean clover had a high proportion of fine roots giving a weighted average C:N of 19 for the whole root system, and could be expected to result in a rapid net mineralisation of N. The root systems of lucerne on the other hand, consisted mainly of coarse roots giving an average C:N of 26, and would be likely to induce a transient net immobilisation of N and a delay in net mineralisation. The same general patterns of N mineralisation/immobilisation were observed in the second experiment. Tissue chemical analyses suggested that even where the total C:N of subterranean clover and lucerne residues were similar, the amounts of C and N in the soluble fraction of the residues and the C:N of that soluble fraction could largely account for the observed differences in N mineralisation/immobilisation.

AB  - Seasonal stubble grazing by sheep is a widespread practice in the Mediterranean basin. However, farmers frequently claim that turning the sheep from marginal lands to the wheat fields after grain harvest increases the risk of weed infestation because of potential weed seed dispersal. Wetested this claim by: (1) examining the potential of seed dispersal by sheep from marginal land via faeces and fleece, and (2) evaluating effects of summer stubble grazing on the size and composition of the weed seedbank and weed vegetation. Analysis of seed density in faeces and fleece showed that the potential for infestation from marginal land by sheep was relatively high during late spring, but strongly decreased in midsummer, when plants in the marginal land had already shed their seeds. The potential of weed transport by faeces was negligible, compared with the seedbank in the field, and little overlapping of species was found between them. Summer grazing by sheep in a no-tillage wheat field over 5 years enlarged the seedbank. This increase, however, was mainly due to the less competitive small-grass species that were not found in the faeces or in the fleece. Combined ploughing, crop rotation, and herbicide application strongly reduced the seedbank. These integrated management practices eliminated the effect of summer grazing on the seedbank.

AB  - The single-probe heat-pulse (SPHP) technique combined with the Fiber-optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) technology can offer novel high-resolution measurements of soil moisture (& theta;) over spatial scales ranging from several centimeters to several kilometers. However, the key limitation of this method is in obtaining the calibration relationship between & theta; and soil thermal conductivity (& lambda;) across a specific field. In a previous study, a new methodology using a Gaussian processes model was presented to account for the spatial variability in the & lambda;-& theta; relationship. The model aggregated & theta; measurements from soil moisture sensors scattered over the SPHP transect with the corresponding DTS & lambda; measurements at their locations. In this study, a novel methodology is tested to optimize the number and locations of soil moisture sensors required to account for the spatial variability of the & lambda;-& theta; relationship to achieve higher accuracy from the SPHP technique. The proposed methodology utilizes hierarchical clustering to analyze the information contained in the spatial structure of the SPHP measurements as the soil dries from a nearly-saturated condition. The proposed methodology was tested using data from a field in Oklahoma. Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to validate the performance of the proposed methodology. The predictions obtained from the proposed methodology resulted in & theta; measurements accuracy comparable to those obtained from the 10% best Monte-Carlo iterations of randomly assigned soil moisture locations. This study demonstrates that the proposed methodology is more efficient than the traditional practice of randomly spreading calibration soil moisture sensors along the SPHP transect.

AB  - We present an analysis of a 3-year time series of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery covering the southern Arabian Peninsula, spanning two devastating typhoons that impacted the region in 2018. The limited vegetation and precipitation in the area allows for clear separation of soil moisture changes from other factors that typically also affect microwave imagery. We generate soil moisture proxies from Interferometric SAR (InSAR) coherence and compare them with a range of other soil moisture products. We estimate the decay timescale over which the surface returns to its pre-storm state for each event and data type, and find that the radar coherence-based timescales tend to be longer than those for the other products. We also find that the coherence-based timescales of the two events differ from each other in a manner that is consistent with seasonal temperature fluctuations and the total rainfall that occurred each time. The higher spatial resolution of the InSAR coherence results and differing sensitivity to the vertical distribution of soil moisture complements the other more temporally dense products, particularly in regions of high heterogeneity along the edge of the storm and within regions where the surface properties change dramatically over small spatial scales. As the frequency and strength of tropical cyclones increase, and as already scarce water resources are utilized further in arid regions, InSAR coherence data constitutes another tool that researchers can use to expand our understanding of these challenges.
   Plain Language Summary In this paper, we compare an estimate of soil moisture that is calculated using high resolution satellite radar imagery to several other estimates of soil moisture from satellite and weather data. We perform this study in a hyper-arid region that experiences infrequent but large rain events, such that we can confidently attribute any change in soil moisture to a single rain event. We find that our method of estimating soil moisture with high resolution radar data agrees well with other methods, which is a promising step towards the development of a high resolution soil moisture product. In addition, we find that this new method records a higher soil moisture signal for a longer period of time after a rain event, revealing that it has a different sensitivity to soil moisture than other satellite and weather data-based methods. Characterizing soil moisture in hyper-arid climates is important because rainfall in these regions poses a significant hazard, and can cause severe damage to infrastructure. In addition, the growing stresses placed on water resources worldwide has resulted in an expansion in efforts to monitor soil moisture and its variability on a global scale.

AB  - Purpose Chicory (Cichorium intybus) scavenges more soil mineral nitrogen (N) than perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne). A glasshouse study was conducted to test whether (a) the percentage of N derived from the atmosphere (%Ndfa) by a companion legume differs when grown with chicory or perennial ryegrass, and (b) there is an optimal ratio of non-legume:legume in a pasture mix that maximises biological N-2 fixation.Methods Chicory or perennial ryegrass was grown as a monoculture, or in a mixture with either lucerne (alfalfa, Medicago sativa) or subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum) at 25:75, 50:50 or 75:25 ratio (non-legume:legume based on plant numbers). Monocultures of lucerne and subterranean clover were included as controls.Results All treatments containing chicory extracted more mineral N from the soil than corresponding treatments containing perennial ryegrass. Subterranean clover %Ndfa was greater than lucerne. Combining lucerne with chicory in a 50:50 or 75:25 mixture increased the efficiency of N-2 fixation by > 20%. Growing chicory with subterranean clover in mixtures of 50:50 or 75:25 resulted in the highest %Ndfa for growth among all treatments (P < 0.05). However, the amounts of N-2 fixed by subterranean clover in the perennial ryegrass-subterranean clover mixture were similar to those in the chicory-subterranean clover mixture since dry matter accumulation from subterranean clover was higher when grown with perennial ryegrass.Conclusion The %Ndfa of legumes was greater when grown with chicory than perennial ryegrass. Chicory mixed with subterranean clover or lucerne in 50:50 ratios provided the optimum balance between legume dry matter yield and N-2 fixation.

AB  - Due to the high economic value of vegetables, farmers in China often apply more fertilizer than is required for plant growth. This leads to phosphorus accumulation in soils, which can pollute the aquatic environment. This conflict arises because vegetables often use nutrients inefficiently, and require high phosphorus levels in the growth medium. In this study, amaranth (Amaranthus mangostanus L.) was grown in soils with 14.7, 23.8, 45.3, 54.6, 74.2, 101 or 116 mg Olsen-P/kg, and with and without phosphorus fertilizer (175 mg P/kg or equivalent to 385 kg P/ha). The yield of amaranth was positively correlated with soil Olsen-P content. CaCl2-P content was positively correlated with Olsen-P content and CaCl2-P markedly increased at Olsen-P contents exceeding 53.8 mg P/kg in the pot experiment or 55.9 mg P/kg in the field survey. These values were regarded as the 'change points' for phosphorus loss; to achieve 85 or 95% of maximum amaranth yield, the amaranth crop required 91or 101 mg Olsen-P/kg soil, respectively, and application of 175 mg P/kg was still able to significantly increase amaranth yield at an Olsen-P level of 74.2 mg P/kg soil. These results indicated that the phosphorus requirement of amaranth exceeded the 'change point' (53.8 or 55.9 mg Olsen-P/kg); the C-min (minimum concentration in the media at which no net influx occurs) of phosphorus for 3-week-old amaranth was 1.55 mu m. This value is much higher than that reported for other crops, and may explain the inefficient P use of amaranth. The high C-min value also indicates that the phosphorus requirement of amaranth is beyond the 'change point' of P loss.

AB  - Irrigation scheduling is the process of determining the appropriate amount and timing of water application to achieve desired crop yield and quality, maximize water conservation, and minimize possible negative effects on the environment, such as nutrient leaching below the crop root zone. Effective irrigation scheduling has been shown to save water, save energy, and help agricultural producers achieve improved yields and quality. However, scientific irrigation scheduling methods generally have remained limited to mostly research applications with relatively low adoption by irrigators. There are several main approaches to irrigation scheduling, including those based on soil water status, plant characteristics, and/or crop modeling. Each of these approaches has advantages as well as limitations and sources of uncertainty and variability, depending on application conditions. This article summarizes progress made in the U.S. in each of the main scheduling approaches in the past ten years (since the 2010 Decennial Irrigation Symposium) and existing challenges and opportunities that should be considered moving forward. This article is intended to guide future research and extension projects in improving adoption of scientific irrigation scheduling approaches.

AB  - Land Surface Models (LSM) have been designed to describe water and energy transfers at the soil-vegetation-atmosphere inter-face, and are therefore essential in many environmental disciplines. These numerical models, driven by the boundary conditions in the atmosphere and in the soil, require adequate knowledge of those vegetation and soil characteristics which are determinant in the characterisation of mass and energy transfers. In view of the fact that, firstly this information is often only partially known, and secondly the transfers are sometimes incorrectly represented, these models can rapidly drift and need to be regularly corrected. To this aim, remote sensing is a promising tool and many studies are currently devoted to the development of assimilation techniques to control their inputs or internal variables. The research presented in this paper contributes to this effort. Its ambition is to explore new methodologies, designed to make use of remote sensing thermal infrared data recorded from space. This study is based on the analysis of links between the characteristics of the diurnal cycle of the surface brightness temperature and the soil-atmosphere interface parameters and variables. The proposed methodology takes advantage of these temperatures cycling features, instead of absolute temperature values, to calibrate the LSM. The results show that the model parameters have a significant impact on the diurnal temperature dynamics, sometimes to a greater extent than on the temperature itself, and that these relationships have diurnal and seasonal variations. As a consequence, the use of TIR data for LSM calibration can be optimised by considering only those parts of the information which are really relevant to parameter calibration.

AB  - Crop water productivity (CWP) has become a recognised indicator in assessing the state of Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6.4-to substantially increase water use efficiency. This indicator, while useful at a global scale, is not comprehensive at a local scale. To fill this gap, this research proposes a CWP framework, that takes advantage of the spatio-temporal availability of remote sensing, that identifies CWP goals and sub-indicators specific to the needs of the targeted domain. Three sub-indicators are considered; (i) a global water productivity score (GWPS), (ii) a local water productivity score (LWPS) and (iii) a land and water use productivity score (YWPS). The GWPS places local CWP in the global context and focuses on maximised CWP. The LWPS differentiates yield zones, normalising for potential product, and focuses on minimising water consumption. The YWPS focuses simultaneously on improving land and water productivity equally The CWP framework was applied to potato in the West Bank, Palestine. Three management practices were compared under each sub-indicator. The case study showed that fields with high and low performance were different under each sub-indicator. The performance associated with different management practices was also different under each sub-indicator. For example, a winter rotation had a higher performance under the YWPS, the fall rotation had a higher performance under the LWPS and under the GWPS there was little difference. The results showed, that depending on the basin goal, not only do the sub-indicators required change, but also the management practices or approach required to reach those basin goals. This highlights the importance of providing a CWP framework with multiple sub-indicators, suitable to basin needs, to ensure that meeting the SDG 6.4 goal does not jeopardise local objectives.

AB  - It is necessary to predict wind erosion events and specify the related effective factors to prioritize management and executive measures to combat desertification caused by wind erosion in arid areas. Therefore, this work aimed to evaluate the applicability of nine machine learning (ML) models (including multivariate adaptive regression splines, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, k-nearest neighbors, genetic programming, support vector machine, Cubist, artificial neural networks, extreme gradient boosting, random forest) and their average for predicting the seasonal dust storm index (DSI) during 2000-2018 in arid regions of Iran. The results showed that the averaging method outperformed the other individual ML models in predicting DSI changes in all seasons. For instance, the averaging methods improved the prediction accuracies for winter, spring, summer, autumn, and dusty seasons by 22%, 39%, 28%, 32%, and 26%, respectively, compared to the multivariate adaptive regression splines. Furthermore, the most important factors in predicting DSI were detected as follows: wind speed for winter, enhanced vegetation index for spring, maximum wind speed for summer, autumn and dusty seasons. In general, our results indicate that the combining of the individual ML models by averaging method help us to develop a more accurate approach for predicting the temporal changes of the dust events in arid regions. Furthermore, the obtained results in this study can be applicable for prioritizing measures in order to minimize the dangers of wind erosion based on the major driving factors.

AB  - Sod phosphorus fractions, maize and cassava P uptakes in natural regrowth fallow and Pueraria phaseoloides fallow systems, as affected by the duration (1-3 years) of fallow, were assessed in 1998 and 1999 in a long-term fallow management trial, established in 1989 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, Ibadan, Nigeria. After one and three years fallow respectively, the mean P accumulation in fallow vegetation was 4.2 and 9.4 kg ha(-1) in 1998, and 8.9 and 12.1 kg ha(-1) in 1999 for natural fallow. For Pueraria, the corresponding values were 6.3 and 7.4 kg ha(-1) in 1998 and 6.1 and 13.5 kg ha(-1) in 1999. The positive effects of fallow lengths on dry matter and P accumulation were not as pronounced under Pueraria. Continuous cropping reduced soil pH and depleted Olsen P more than crop-fallow rotations under both fallow systems. An increase in fallow duration enhanced the availability of resin P2NaHCO3-, and NaOHextractable P fractions, especially under natural fallow. Continuous cropping in a natural fallow system resulted in lower resin inorganic P (P-i) and NaHCO3 -extractable inorganic and organic P (P-o) fractions, and higher refractory P fractions (concentrated HCl-extractable P-i and P-o and residual P) as compared to crop-fallow rotations. Although continuous cropping in the Pueraria system resulted in higher refractory P fractions than the crop-fallow rotations, the effects of fallow length on P fractions were not consistent or pronounced. Maize and cassava P uptakes increased with fallow duration. Phosphorous in maize grain was positively correlated with fallow vegetation P accumulation. Total P uptake by maize was positively but weakly correlated with NaHCO3-P-o, Olsen P and fallow vegetation P accumulation.

AB  - This study improved hydrologic data assimilation through integrating the capabilities of particle filter (PF) and ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) methods, leading to two integrated data assimilation schemes: the coupled EnKF and PF (CEnPF) and parallelized EnKF and PF (PEnPF) approaches. The applicability and usefulness of CEnPF and PEnPF were demonstrated using a conceptual rainfall-runoff model. The performance of two new developed data assimilation methods and traditional EnKF and PF approaches was tested through a synthetic experiment and two real-world cases with one located in the Jing River basin and one located in the Yangtze River basin. The results show that both PEnPF and CEnPF approaches have more opportunities to provide better results for both deterministic and probabilistic predictions than traditional EnKF and PF approaches. Moreover, the computational time of the two integrated methods is manageable. But the proposed PEnPF may need much more time for some large-scale or time-consuming hydrologic models since it generally needs three times of model runs used by EnKF, PF and CEnPF.

AB  - IntroductionTo investigate the effects of no-tillage with straw mulching on the absorption and utilization of soil nitrogen (N), fertilizer N, and straw N by rice under paddy-upland rotations. MethodsA field experiment with three cropping systems: fallow-rice rotation without straw mulching (FRN), wheat-rice rotation with wheat mulching in rice season (WRS), and oilseed rape-rice rotation with oilseed rape straw mulching in rice season (ORS) was conducted from 2015 to 2017, along with a mini-plot experiment with N-15-labeled urea and straws, which was conducted in 2017. ResultsNo-tillage with straw reduced rice N uptake up to 20 days after transplanting, the total amount of fertilizer N uptake of WRS and ORS rice plants was 46.33 and 61.67 kg/ha, respectively, which was 9.02 and 45.10% higher than that of FRN plants. Soil N was the main source for rice growth, followed by fertilizer N. Soil N uptake by WRS and ORS rice plants was 21.75 and 26.82% higher than that of FRN plants, accounting for 72.37 and 65.47%, respectively, of the total N accumulated in rice plants. Straw mulching increased the N utilization efficiency of tillering, panicle, and total fertilizer by 2.84-25.30%; however, base fertilizer was dependent on straw mulching. The total amount of N released from WRS and ORS straw mulching in the rice season was 34.97 and 24.82 kg/ha, respectively; however, only 3.04 and 4.82% of it was absorbed by the rice plants, accounting for only 0.62 and 0.66% of the total accumulated N. DiscussionNo-tillage with straw mulching under paddy-upland rotations increased the N utilization of rice, especially for the absorption of soil N. These results provide theoretical information for the effective utilization of straw and rational N application practices in rice-based cropping systems.

AB  - During the summers of 2021 and 2022, we conducted a study in four Georgia Piedmont pastures to assess the effect of the presence of filth flies and epigeal arthropods on carbon and nitrogen emissions and soil nitrogen retention from lax rotational grazing systems under a legacy of low fertilization. Carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and ammonia (NH3) emissions were measured from dung on days 0, 4, 8, and 15 following depositions. Soil and manure samples were collected on days 0 and 16 and analyzed for ammonium (NH4+), nitrate (NO3-), plant-available nitrogen (PAN), and potentially mineralizable nitrogen (PMN). Manure samples were analyzed for total Kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN). The numbers of filth flies ovipositing and emerging from manure, fire ants, and epigeal arthropods around the manure were determined. Our results indicated that more than 12 ovipositing filth flies per manure pat can reduce PMN by up to 14.7 kg of nitrogen per hectare, while an increase in the biodiversity and abundance of predators may help to increase PAN and PMN in grazing systems, as well as decrease the number of emerging filth flies.

AB  - Knowledge about the changes in soil nitrogen pools under different tillage managements is necessary to assess the feasibility of adoption of conservation practices for sustaining productivity and protecting the environment in dryland farming in northern China. We investigated the long-term effects (22 years) of no-till with residue retention (NTR) on total soil N and its fractions in a dry-land winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system in northern China. Compared with conventional tillage without residue retention (CT), significantly higher soil total N (STN) concentrations were observed in the surface soil layer (0-10 cm) under NTR. Meanwhile, more soil N accumulated for the whole soil profile (0 to 60 cm) in the NTR (3.38 Mg ha(-1)) treatment relative to the CT (3.17 Mg ha(-1)) treatment. The particulate organic matter N (PON), microbial biomass N (MBN), and water extractable organic N (WEON) levels in the NTR treatments were 52.3%, 116%, and 69.4% greater at a depth of 0-5 cm and 41.6%, 108%, and 44.9% greater at a depth of 5-10 cm, respectively, compared with the CT treatment. However, no differences were observed below the 10 cm layer. At a depth of 0-60 cm, the soil NH4-N content under CT was higher than that under NTR However, the soil NO3-N contents in the NTR treatments were significantly greater at a depth of 0-10 cm and were not significantly different at a depth of 10-60 cm, relative to the CT treatment. Significantly positive correlations were observed between the STN and the labile organic N fractions. Overall, the results show that no-till coupled with residue retention is an effective management method for improving soil N stocks and increasing soil fertility. Nonetheless, other benefits associated with NT and residue retention present greater challenges regarding their popularization and application in the dryland farming areas in northern China.

AB  - In 2005, a 7-ha artificial watershed (Chicken Creek) was built on a post mined landscape in Lusatia, Germany from sandy substrates of Pleistocene origin, commonly used in reclamation. The watershed was developed to investigate the initial phase of soil and ecosystem development under natural conditions. At this early stage, mineral nitrogen in young sandy soils is primarily limited and nitrogen fixing legumes become key components of natural succession. Local abundant pioneering legumes Lotus corniculatus and Trifolium arvense and one pioneer grass species Calamagrostis epigeios were investigated 5 years after watershed construction. In this study, we investigated the influence of spatial root and nodule distribution of these species on soil nitrogen accumulation. Soil, including roots, was sampled from field monoliths covered with the aforementioned plant species. Root systems of both legumes were mainly restricted to the upper 20 cm of soil, whereas roots of C. epigeios also developed strongly at greater depths. A positive relationship was found, with higher plant densities associated with higher root densities which were associated with higher nodule densities for legumes and which were all associated with significantly higher soil nitrogen content relative to non-vegetated areas. This research provides rare information on the role root systems of pioneer legumes play in soil nitrogen input in the early stage of soil and ecosystem development during revegetation by natural succession.

AB  - Aims Belowground legume nitrogen (N) composed of roots and rhizodeposition is an important N input to soils, but published data of belowground N vary broadly, probably due to extrapolation from short-term experiments and dissimilar growing conditions. We quantified belowground N inputs of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) during two consecutive years in a clover-grass sward along a soil nutrient availability gradient.
   Methods We established a red clover-perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) model sward in microplots located in field plots of the DOK experiment, which has a 33-year history of organic and conventional cropping, resulting in a soil nutrient availability gradient. Four treatments were examined: the zero fertilisation control, bio-organic with half and full dose manure application, and the conventional system with mineral fertilisation at full dose. We studied the development of clover aboveground and belowground N using multiple pulse N-15 urea leaf labelling.
   Results Belowground clover N increased over time and with rising nutrient availability and was proportional to aboveground clover N at all times. Belowground clover N amounted to 40% of aboveground clover N during two consecutive years, irrespective of the nutrient availability status. Belowground clover N development was initially dominated by fast root growth, followed by enhanced root turnover during the second year. Potassium availability limited clover growth and total N accumulation in treatments with low nutrient availability.
   Conclusions Belowground red clover N inputs could be estimated from aboveground N by a constant factor of 0.4, regardless of the nutrient availability and cultivation time. Root turnover led to a distinct absolute increase of N rhizodeposition over time. Hence, N rhizodeposition, with an 80% share of belowground N, was the predominant N pool at the end of the second year.

AB  - Pot experiments were carried out to investigate the complementary N use between intercropped fababean (Vicia faba L. cv. Linxia Dacandou) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L cv. 8354). These pots were separated into two compartments, either by a solid barrier to prevent root contact and N movement, by a nylon mesh (30 mum) to prevent root contact, but allow N exchange, or no root barrier between the compartments to allow root intermingling. Root contact enhanced N-15 acquisition of wheat but decreased that of fababean. Nitrogen derived from fertilizer (Ndff) by wheat was 73, 91 and 130 mg pot(-1) in the treatment with solid barrier, with mesh barrier and without barrier, respectively. For fababean, these values were 38, 25 and 8 mg pot(-1), respectively. Accordingly, increased competition from wheat roots resulted in a decrease in soil and fertilizer N uptake by fababean, and correspondingly, higher percentage of N derived from atmosphere N-2 (%Ndfa). The %Ndfa of fababean was 58%, 80%, and 91% in the treatment with solid barrier, with mesh barrier and without barrier, respectively. Nitrogen transfer from fababean to wheat was estimated by the indirect N-15 isotope dilution technique and by direct plant labeling via petiole injection of a N-15 solution. With the indirect method, N transferred from fababean to the associated wheat was 2 mg with a mesh barrier and 6 mg without barrier. Using direct labeling method, N transferred from fababean to companion wheat was 7 mg, equal to 15% of total N in wheat.

AB  - This study investigates whether a thermodynamically optimal hillslope structure can, if existent, serve as a first guess for uncalibrated predictions of rainfall-runoff. To this end we propose a thermodynamic framework to link rainfall-runoff processes and dynamics of potential energy, kinetic energy and capillary binding energy in catchments and hillslopes. The starting point is that hydraulic equilibrium in soil corresponds to local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), characterized by a local maximum entropy/minimum of free energy of soil water. Deviations from LTE occur either due to evaporative losses, which increase absolute values of negative capillary binding energy of soil water and reduce its potential energy, or due to infiltration of rainfall, which increases potential energy of soil water and reduces the strength of capillary binding energy. The amplitude and relaxation time of these deviations depend on climate, vegetation, soil hydraulic functions, topography and density of macropores. Based on this framework we analysed the free energy balance of hillslopes within numerical experiments that perturbed model structures with respect to the surface density of macropores. These model structures have been previously shown to allow successful long-term simulations of the water balances of the Weiherbach and the Malalc-ahuello catchments, which are located in distinctly different pedological and climatic settings. Our findings offer a new perspective on different functions of preferential flow paths depending on the pedological setting. Free energy dynamics of soil water in the cohesive soils of the Weiherbach is dominated by dynamics of capillary binding energy. Macropores act as dissipative wetting structures by enlarging water flows against steep gradients in soil water potential after long dry spells. This implies accelerated depletion of these gradients and faster relaxation back towards LTE. We found two local optima in macropore density that maximize reduction rates of free energy of soil water during rainfall-driven conditions. These two optima exist because reduction rates of free energy are, in this case, a second-order polynomial of the wetting rate, which implicitly depends on macroporosity. An uncalibrated long-term simulation of the water balance of the Weiherbach catchment based on the first optimum macroporosity performed almost as well as the best fit when macroporosity was calibrated to match rainfall-runoff. In the Malalc-ahuello catchment we did not find an apparent optimum density of macropores, because free energy dynamics of soil water during rainfall-driven conditions is dominated by increases of potential energy. Macropores act as dissipative drainage structures by enhancing export of potential energy. No optimum macropore density exists in this case because potential energy change rates scale linearly with the wetting rate. We found, however, a distinguished macroporosity that assures steady-state conditions of the potential energy balance of the soil, in the sense that average storage of potential energy is compensated by average potential energy export. This distinguished macroporosity was close to the value that yielded the best fit of rainfall-runoff behaviour during a calibration exercise and allowed a robust estimate of the annual runoff coefficient. Our findings are promising for predictions in ungauged catchments (PUB) as the optimal/distinguished model structures can serve as a first guess for uncalibrated predictions of rainfall-runoff.
   They also offer an alternative for classifying catchments according to their similarity of the free energy balance components.

AB  - Accurate early season predictions of crop yield at the within-field scale can be used to address a range of crop production, management, and precision agricultural challenges. While the remote sensing of within-field insights has been a research goal for many years, it is only recently that observations with the required spatio-temporal resolutions, together with efficient assimilation methods to integrate these into modeling frameworks, have become available to advance yield prediction efforts. Here we explore a yield prediction approach that combines daily high-resolution CubeSat imagery with the APSIM crop model. The approach employs APSIM to train a linear regression that relates simulated yield to simulated leaf area index (LAI). That relationship is then used to identify the optimal regression date at which the LAI provides the best prediction of yield: in this case, approximately 14 weeks prior to harvest. Instead of applying the regression on satellite imagery that is coincident, or closest to, the regression date, our method implements a particle filter that integrates CubeSat-based LAI into APSIM to provide end-of-season high-resolution (3 m) yield maps weeks before the optimal regression date. The approach is demonstrated on a rainfed maize field located in Nebraska, USA, where suitable collections of both imagery and in-situ data were available for assessment. The procedure does not require in-field data to calibrate the regression model, with results showing that even with a single assimilation step, it is possible to provide yield estimates with good accuracy up to 21 days before the optimal regression date. Yield spatial variability was reproduced reasonably well, with a strong correlation to independently collected measurements (R2 = 0.73 and rRMSE = 12%). When the field averaged yield was compared, our approach reduced yield prediction error from 1 Mg/ha (control case based on a calibrated APSIM model), to 0.5 Mg/ha (using satellite imagery alone), and then to 0.2 Mg/ha (results with assimilation up to three weeks prior to the optimal regression date). Such a capacity to provide spatially explicit yield predictions early in the season has considerable potential to enhance digital agricultural goals and improve end-of-season yield predictions.

AB  - Researching glacier-melt impacted hydrology in the Andes motivates us to collect on-demand, high-resolution multispectral imagery, and digital elevation models (DEMs). While adverse conditions in these remote mountain locations present technical challenges for motorized unmanned aerial systems (UAS), consistent katabatic winds allow for testing lightweight Kite Aerial Photography (KAP) as an alternative. We use a KAP platform at 4000 msl in the Peruvian Andes to survey a 0.23km(2) pro-glacial alpine meadow and wetland system. Using structure from motion we develop a 2 cm orthomosaic, dense point cloud with 101 points/m(2), and 5-100 cm DEMs. Accuracy of the DEM was found to be equivalent to a 1m aerial lidar DEM; however, the denser point cloud derived from the KAP platform retained better definition of fine surface features. The high resolution, robustness and low acquisition cost of these platforms indicates strong potential for the monitoring of fine scale and rapid changes in mountain environments.

AB  - Droughts of increasing frequency and severity are expected to have a great impact on vegetation restoration in semiarid ecosystems by reducing water availability to plants. Understanding the functional plasticity of root systems in plant water uptake and the response to extreme droughts is of critical importance for predicting revegetation dynamics under future extreme climates. Sampling was undertaken over a two-year period to investigate the seasonality of water use strategy and growing status of one mature exotic shrub species Caragana korshinskii and one native subshrub species Artemisia gmelinii in both its young and mature growing stages. We investigated stable isotopes, made in situ soil water observations, and recorded functional root distribution. The spring and summer drought in 2015, especially the record low precipitation in July, allowed us to examine the impact of extreme drought on plant water sources and stem mortality. The results revealed that both exotic and native species exhibited significant seasonal patterns in water source use, following shifts in soil water content; they were overall positively correlated with soil water availability. The exotic species C. korshinskii used more soil water from subsurface layers compared to the native species A. gmelinii. The prolonged drought reduced the plasticity of water use strategy and resulted in clear stem mortality of both the young and mature native species but not the exotic species. The results indicate that the native shrub A. gmelinii is less resistant to extreme natural drought than exotic shrub C. korshinskii and hence could be more severely affected by future extreme climatic episodes. This implies that vegetation restoration may be greatly disturbed by extreme droughts in semiarid ecosystems.

AB  - Precision agriculture (PA), also known as "site-specific management (SSM)", "prescription farming", or "variable-rate technology", offers a practical option to address the rising food demand for optimal and sustainable agriculture. Effectively identifying and analysing the spatial and temporal changes in the fields requires the application of agriculture sciences and information technologies. To sustainably conserve natural resources, including water, air, and soil quality, while reducing production costs, various precision agriculture approaches have evolved worldwide. The application of sensor-based technology and remote sensing modifies conventional farming methods. The agricultural industry has grown remarkably due to this modernization of agriculture. This study analyses every technical facet of precision agriculture. It looks at different sensor types and pertinent technology related to precision farming. Precision agriculture and the tools and technologies needed to implement it are also discussed, with an eye on the needs of small-scale farmers in developing countries.

AB  - In semi-arid environments, vegetation is not homogeneous, but rather self-organized into spatial patterns. And spatial patterns of vegetation are a central feature of these semi-arid areas. Thus, in this paper, we give detailed analysis of a vegetation model in arid ecosystems. According to the dispersion relation formula, we discuss the changes of the wavelength, with respect to the rainfall and plant mortality rate. The obtained results show that, as rainfall being decreased, spotted, striped and "black-eye" patterns emerge successively.

AB  - The objectives of this research were to evaluate temporal and spatial variability in the impact of strip tillage and oat cover crop residue on Powell amaranth emergence and to determine the role of rainfall in mediating these effects. In field experiments conducted in 2010, 2011, and 2012, Powell amaranth seeds were sown in a fully factorial combination of two tillage types (strip tillage [ST] vs. full-width tillage [FWT]) and cover crop residue (oats vs. none) at either 0 d after tillage (DAT) or 7 to 13 DAT to monitor emergence at two timings. In ST plots, seeds were sown both in the tilled zone ("in-row," IR), and between these tilled zones (" between-row," BR). In 2011 and 2012, three levels of rainfall were simulated in subplots by either excluding rainfall, allowing natural rainfall, or supplementing rainfall with irrigation. In most cases, ST and oats residue either had no effect on or suppressed emergence of Powell amaranth sown at the early planting date. In contrast, the emergence response to ST and residue at the later planting date was generally smaller and more variable, with increases in emergence observed in several cases. Differences between tillage systems in emergence were most pronounced in the BR zone but also occurred IR in some cases, suggesting that interzonal effects on biotic or abiotic factors influenced emergence. Oat residue effects-but rarely tillage effects-were often mediated by simulated rainfall, with increases in emergence occurring mostly in dry conditions and decreases occurring more commonly in wetter conditions. These results demonstrate that the suppressive effects of cover crops and ST on weed emergence are inconsistent, temporally and spatially variable, and dependent on complex interactions with factors including rainfall.

AB  - Understanding root signals and their consequences for the whole plant physiology is one of the keys to tackling the water-saving challenge in agriculture. The implementation of water-saving irrigation strategies, such as the partial root zone drying (PRD) method, is part of a comprehensive approach to enhance water use efficiency. To reach this goal tools are needed for the evaluation of the root's and soil water dynamics in time and space. In controlled laboratory conditions, using a rhizotron built for geoelectrical tomography imaging, we monitored the spatio-temporal changes in soil electrical resistivity (ER) for more than a month corresponding to eight alternating water inputs cycles. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) was complemented with electrical current imaging (ECI) using plant-stem-induced electrical stimulation. To estimate soil water content in the rhizotron during the experiment, we incorporated Archie's law as a constitutive model. We demonstrated that under mild water stress conditions, it is practically impossible to spatially distinguish the limited-water-availability effects using ECI. We evidenced that the current source density spatial distribution varied during the course of the experiment with the transpiration demand but without any significant relationship to the soil water content changes. On the other hand, ERT showed spatial patterns associated with irrigation and, to a lesser degree, to RWU (root water uptake) and hydraulic redistribution. The interpretation of the geoelectrical imaging with respect to root activity was strengthened and correlated with indirect observations of the plant transpiration using a weight monitoring lysimeter and direct observation of the plant leaf gas exchanges.

AB  - Concern about catastrophic tipping points has motivated inquiry to better understand ecosystem dynamics in the presence of human action. This requires that we confront multiple challenges in the evaluation of complex systems. One challenge is that resilience has proven difficult to quantify; another issue is that the value of model complexity relative to system complexity is disputed; and finally, local methods for assessing uncertainty are inadequate for more complex models. We address these three challenges simultaneously by proposing a means of evaluating ecological resilience via employment of global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis and comparing models of varying complexity. We suggest that probability distribution functions in output from global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis can be interpreted in terms of ball-and-cup diagrams used in systems theory to visualize ecological resilience. This permits quantification of ecological resilience in terms of the probability of whether a system will remain in a pre-existing state or shift to a different state. We outline the methods for using global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis to evaluate ecological resilience and provide examples from recent research. We highlight applications of these methods to assessment of ecosystem management options in terms of their ramifications for ecological resilience. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - A large-plot field experiment was conducted at Keiser, AR, from fall of 2010 through fall of 2013 to understand to what extent soybean in-crop herbicide programs and postharvest fall management practices impact Palmer amaranth population density and seed production over three growing seasons. The effect of POST-only (glyphosate-only) or PRE followed by (fb) POST (glyphosate or glufosinate) + residual herbicide treatments were evaluated alone and in combination with postharvest management options of soybean residue spreading or soil incorporation, use of cover crops, windrowing with/without burning, and residue removal. Significant differences were observed between fall management practices on Palmer amaranth population density each fall. The use of cover crops and residue collection and removal fb the incorporation of crop residues into soil during the formation of beds were the most effective practices in reducing Palmer amaranth population. In contrast, the effects of fall management practices on Palmer amaranth seed production were inconsistent among years. The inclusion of a PRE herbicide application into the herbicide program significantly reduced Palmer amaranth population density and subsequent seed production each year when compared to the glyphosate-only program. Additionally, the glufosinate-containing residual program was superior to the glyphosate-containing residual program in reducing Palmer amaranth seed production. PRE fb POST herbicides resulted in significant decreases in the Palmer amaranth population density and seed production compared to POST application of glyphosate alone for all fall management practices, including the no-till practice. This study demonstrated that crop residue management such as chaff removal from the field, the use of cover crops, or seed incorporation during bed formation in combination with an effective PRE plus POST residual herbicide program is important for optimizing in-season management of Palmer amaranth and subsequently reducing the population density, which has a profound impact on lessening the risk for herbicide resistance and the consistency and effectiveness of future weed management efforts.

AB  - The notion of a phosphorus (P) circular economy provides the philosophy, framework, and opportunity to enable food production systems to become more efficient, sustainable, and resilient to a future P scarcity or sudden price shock. Whilst P recovery and recycling are central strategies for closing the P cycle, additional gains in environmental performance of food systems can be obtained by further minimising the amounts of P (a) introduced into the food system by lowering system P demand and (b) lost from the system by utilising legacy P stores in the landscape. This minimisation is an important cascading component of circularisation because it reduces the amounts of P circulating in the system, the amounts of P required to be recycled/recovered and the storage of unused P in the landscape, whilst maintaining agricultural output. The potential for circularisation and minimisation depends on regional differences in these P flow dynamics. We consider incremental and transformative management interventions towards P minimisation within circular economies, and how these might be tempered by the need to deliver a range of ecosystem services. These interventions move away from current production philosophies based on risk-averse, insurance-based farming, and current consumption patterns which have little regard for their environmental impact. We argue that a greater focus on P minimisation and circularisation should catalyse different actors and sectors in the food chain to embrace P sustainability and should empower future research needs to provide the confidence for them to do so without sacrificing future regional food security.

AB  - Mechanistic catchment-scale phosphorus models appear to perform poorly where diffuse sources dominate. We investigate the reasons for this for one model, INCA-P, testing model output against 18 months of daily data in a small Scottish catchment. We examine key model processes and provide recommendations for model improvement and simplification. Improvements to the particulate phosphorus simulation are especially needed. The model evaluation procedure is then generalised to provide a checklist for identifying why model performance may be poor or unreliable, incorporating calibration, data, structural and conceptual challenges. There needs to be greater recognition that current models struggle to produce positive Nash-Sutcliffe statistics in agricultural catchments when evaluated against daily data. Phosphorus modelling is difficult, but models are not as useless as this might suggest. We found a combination of correlation coefficients, bias, a comparison of distributions and a visual assessment of time series a better means of identifying realistic simulations.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate plant-available N pools and the role of N management index (NMI) in the surface (0-20 cm) of a fluvo-aquic soil after 18 years of fertilization treatments under a wheat-maize cropping system in the North China Plain. The experiment included seven treatments: (1) NPK, balanced application of chemical fertilizer NPK; (2) OM, application of organic manure; (3) 1/2OMN, application of half organic manure plus chemical fertilizer NPK; (4) NP, application of chemical fertilizer NP; (5) PK, application of chemical fertilizer PK; (6) NK, application of chemical fertilizer NK; and (7) CK, unfertilized control. Total organic N (TON), microbial biomass N (MBN), labile N (LN), inorganic N (ION, including ammonium (NH (4) (+) )-N and nitrate (NO (3) (-) )-N) contents, net ammonification rate (NAR), net nitrification rate (NNR), net N mineralization rate (NNMR), and NMI in the fertilized treatments were higher than in the unfertilized treatment. Application of chemical fertilizer N (NPK, NP, and NK) increased ION in soils, compared with application of organic N or control. Nitrate N prevailed over exchangeable NH (4) (+) -N in all treatments. Nitrogen storage of the OM- and 1/2OMN-treated soils increased by 50.0% and 24.3%, respectively, over the NPK-treated soil, which had 5.4-22.5% more N than NP-, PK-, and NK-treated soils. The MBN, LN, and ION accounted for 1.7-2.4%, 25.7-34.2%, and 1.4-2.9% of TON, respectively, in different fertilization treatments. The surface soils (0-20-cm layer) in all treatments mineralized 43.6-152.9 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) for crop growth. Microbial biomass N was probably the better predictor of N mineralization, as it was correlated significantly (P < 0.01) with NNMR. The OM and 1/2OMN treatments were not an optimal option for farmers when the crop yield and labor cost were taken into consideration but an optimal option for increasing soil N supply capacity and N sequestration in soil. The NPK treatment showed the highest crop yields and increased soil N fractions through crop residues and exudates input, and thus, it may be considered as a sustainable system in the North China Plain.

AB  - PurposeAs LCA is widely applied for benchmarking and decision-making, the need to clarify the ambiguity within fundamental methodological issues is imperative. Nutrient substitution, a subcategory of substitution, where credits are given for secondary fertilizer, is one of the common means to solve multi-functionality in LCA studies. This review aims to unravel the unique challenges associated with nutrient substitution, given the increasing relevance attributed to this topic.MethodsA systematic review of LCA studies available in Scopus and Web of Science (WoS) has been conducted. Studies about the recovery of nutrients from waste streams to produce fertilizer were scrutinized. As this review focuses on nutrient substitution methodology, only studies applying substitution for secondary fertilizer were included. PRISMA checklist has been used for reporting and completeness check of the review. Results are demonstrated from system modeling and explicit substitution procedure perspectives, supplemented by an investigation on sensitivity analysis.Results and discussionAs a general caveat, poor documentation and low transparency have been observed. Substitution has been used to model attributional (ALCA) and consequential LCA (CLCA) systems. The choice of functional unit combined with nutrient substitution in ALCA could attribute impacts to other functions than those studied. The determination of system boundary, especially the incorporation of the Use on Land (UoL) stage and avoided UoL emissions, is not always in accordance with the selected system modeling. Furthermore, there is no consensus on calculating the nutrient substitution rate. Single and aggregated factors comprising internal product quality, external-environmental, and external-societal variables have been identified. A prevalent observation among most studies is the absence of a sensitivity analysis pertaining to the nutrient substitution rate.ConclusionThe consistency of nutrient substitution cannot be achieved without an unambiguous definition and connotation of substitution and system modeling. The exclusion of the UoL phase not only limits the scope of a study but also fails to reflect quality differences between primary and secondary products. The key lies in elevating awareness regarding the intricacies of nutrient substitution, which consequently necessitates a rigorous definition and integration of influential factors when calculating substitutability.

AB  - This study explicates the scope of published literature on the influence of attitudes and perceptions on the intention to use human excreta and human excreta derived materials in agriculture. Using a scoping review methodology, search results from Scopus and Web of Science were screened and synthesized using the DistillerSR web-based application. Out of the 1192 studies identified, 22 published articles met the inclusion criteria. Additional studies were identified by keyword enrichment, hand-searching, and snowballing in other electronic data bases. The benefit perception of the soil health, income, and yield was the main driver for positive attitudes. Perceived health risk and socio-cultural factors were reported as the main barriers to the use of human excreta derived materials in agriculture. Limited information, availability, collection, transport, and storage were the other reported perceived barriers. The influence of socioeconomic and demographic factors on farmers' attitudes and perceptions was inconclusive, which is potentially attributed to contextual and methodological differences. Social and behavior change communication through community mass campaigns and targeting interventions segregated by socioeconomic and demographic contexts is recommended for development interventions. Future empirical studies could focus on the influence of crop types, treatment processes, food preparation and processing on attitudes and perceptions.

AB  - Under semiarid Mediterranean conditions irrigated maize (Zea mays L.) has been associated with nitrate pollution of surface water and groundwater. Cover crops grown during the intercrop period of maize could reduce N leaching. A 2-yr experiment was conducted in drainage lysimeters with three cover crops: barley (Hordeum vulgare L), winter rape (Brassica rapa L.), or common vetch (Vicia sativa L.). Bare soil was used as control treatment. Maize was fertilized with 300 kg ha(-1) N in the control, and this amount was reduced after a cover crop according to the N content in the aboveground cover crop biomass. Barley and winter rape biomass had a higher N content than vetch (130-170 vs. 50 kg ha(-1)). The vetch treatment did not reduce N leaching or affect maize yield. The barley and winter rape treatments reduced N leaching by 80% compared to the control (25 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) mainly due to a reduction of NO3-N concentration in drainage. Maize yield was reduced by 2.7 Mg ha(-1) after barley and winter rape but still high (approximate to 14 Mg ha(-1)). This reduction was due to an N deficiency caused by lower soil N in spring after the cover crop and insufficient N mineralization and/or lack of synchronization with maize N uptake. To use nonlegume winter cover crops to reduce N leaching in monoculture maize it is necessary to consider that N mineralization may not be sufficient to fulfill maize N requirements and N fertilizer adjustment tools should be developed.

AB  - Improved farming practices are needed to produce more food in a sustainable way. This study assessed 12 combinations of cover crop mixtures and amendment treatments and their effects on shoot and root dry (matter (DM) weights, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) uptakes in plants, Mehlich-3 extractable P (P-M3) and K (K-M3). Shoot and root DM weights were increased by 30-63% with combinations of clover-based cover crop mixtures and 65 Mg ha(-1) of municipal solid food waste (MSFW) compared with synthetic fertilizer. The combination of clover-based cover crop mixtures with MSFW increased N uptake by 38 and 30%, P uptake by 57 and 40% and K uptake by 77 and 77% compared with fertilized and unfertilized treatments, respectively. The combination of vetch-based cover crop mixtures with MSFW had no effect on N uptake, but increased P uptake on average by 43%, and K uptake on average by 11% compared with fertilized and unfertilized treatments. The highest soil P-M3 and K-M3 values were obtained with additions of MSFW, while the lowest were obtained with synthetic fertilizer indicating that the amount of P and K added with MSFW were greater than cover crop needs. Combining cover crop mixtures and MSFW at levels recommended for N fertilization allows meeting cover crops' nutrient needs and increases biomass inputs to agricultural soils, but long-term monitoring of soil P is required to limit potential P build-up.

AB  - The potential for nitrate (NO3-) to leach is enhanced following cultivation of pastoral land, due to rapid mineralization of labile soil organic matter (SOM). In a 7-yr field trial in New Zealand, we examined the impacts of tillage intensity [intensive (plowing to 20 cm), minimum, or no-tillage] and winter cover crops (forage rape) on NO3- leaching following cultivation of permanent (sheep [Ovis aries]-grazed) pasture to grow arable crops (the rotation included barley [Hordeum vulgare L.], wheat [Triticum aestivum L.], and pea [Pisum sativum L.]). Permanent pasture and permanent fallow (maintained plant-free using herbicides, i.e., not cultivated or fertilized) treatments were included as controls. Losses of NO3--N were calculated from soil solution NO3--N concentrations (measured in ceramic suction cups installed at 600 mm) and drainage volumes. Cumulative NO3--N leached over 7 yr ranged from 20 to 428 kg N ha(-1), with least N lost under pasture. Residual soil mineral N in autumn accounted for similar to 30% of the variability in leaching. Nitrate leaching under arable crops generally increased rapidly as winter rainfall (range 78-352 mm yr(-1)) increased. Winter cover crops were effective in reducing NO3--N leaching losses, particularly in drier winters when about 50% less N leached where cover crops were grown. On average, annual leaching was only 10 to 18 kg N ha(-1) in the presence of cover crops. Tillage had relatively little influence on leaching, though use of minimum tillage for autumn cultivation resulted in significantly (P < 0.001) less NO3--N leaching than either intensive or no tillage. Largest leaching losses were recorded in the unfertilized, permanent fallow where there was no plant sink for NO3-N derived from SOM mineralization. Growing a crop during the winter period, combined with good N management practices to minimize pre-winter soil mineral N, provides the best option to keep NO3- leaching within the acceptable range for arable cropping in New Zealand.

AB  - Understanding the process by which nutrients and solids enter waterways from pastures in the Great Lakes district, New South Wales, Australia, may assist in maintaining water quality to ensure ongoing environmental and economic sustainability of the region. Rainfall simulations, using a 100-year return storm event, were conducted to determine nutrient and suspended solid concentrations in the runoff of 8 pasture sites in 3 of the catchments in the district. On 5 of the 8 sites, considerable concentrations of N or P were mobilised during the simulated rainfall event, but average nutrient concentrations and total loads across all sites were relatively low and similar to other studies of nutrient runoff from pastures. In addition, low runoff coefficients indicated that runoff is probably not the major pathway for nutrient losses from pasture in this area. Overall, rainfall runoff responses at the sites were similar in the 3 catchments. In contrast, the results suggest that, despite generating more runoff, the sites in the Wang Wauk catchment generated less nutrients in runoff than the sites in the Wallamba and Myall catchments. There was no difference in total suspended solids loads for the sites analysed by catchment. Relationships between soil physical and chemical characteristics and total nutrients loads or cumulative runoff were not strong.

AB  - Due to the environmental consequences of annual-dominated cropping systems, there is an increasing need to identify agronomic strategies that incorporate perennial crops. One strategy for increasing perennial cover is through the targeted use of annually harvested perennial food and bioproduct crops in buffer strips, which has the potential to create new revenue streams for farmers and substantially mitigate agricultural nutrient pollution from conventional cropping systems. As buffers are typically installed on marginal land, it is critical to understand how landscape position influences the success of perennial crops. The objectives of this study were to determine the relatively early influence of landscape position on the productivity of a variety of perennial crops and their subsequent soil nutrients and soil water storing capabilities. In this experiment, nine perennial (alfalfa, alsike clover, indiangrass, switchgrass, big bluestem, prairie cordgrass, intermediate wheatgrass, high-diversity polyculture, low-diversity polyculture) and two annual (corn, soybean) crops were planted across two landscape positions (hillslope and deposition). Plant biomass, plant tissue nitrogen, soil moisture, and soil NO3-N and NH4-N were measured and compared at two different locations in Minnesota. Overall, the polyculture mixes, and to some extent intermediate wheatgrass, performed the best with respect to biomass production while also providing ecosystem services across most soil by landscape position combinations tested in this study. However, there were some important findings specific to each soil and landscape position combination, mainly oriented toward biomass production. We also observed temporal patterns in soil moisture and depth-related patterns in soil N reductions. This study presents an opportunity to optimize the use of perennial crops on marginal agricultural lands for improved environmental and economic benefit.

AB  - Development of legume-based farming systems has resulted in Australian agriculture being globally competitive. There is now political pressure for agriculture to become accountable for 'off-site' environmental consequences. Farming systems relying on annual species are unsustainable because of a mismatch between the supply and demand of water and N, resulting in N leakage to streams or groundwater. Rainfall in excess of plant requirements coupled with N build-up, permeable soils, limited opportunities for reduction and proximity to surface or groundwater present risks for leakage of NO3-N. We present examples of N leakage from legume systems in southern Australia, where rainfall exceeds 450 mm yr(-1), and the evidence suggesting that leakage contributes to stream and groundwater pollution. N build-up in autumn through mineralisation of organic-N from legume-based systems often exceeds 100 kg N ha(-1) and N leakage losses can be 15-35 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Stream and groundwater N pollution issues are emerging. Surface water quality problems are already apparent in Victoria although the contribution from legumes, N fertilisers and point sources remains unresolved. Examples of groundwater problems where legumes are a contributing factor have been recorded in New South Wales (NSW), South Australia (SA), Western Australia (WA) and Victoria. In Victoria, areas at risk of N groundwater contamination are found along the Great Dividing Range and in southern Victoria. Groundwater pollution causes concern because once problems are found they take decades to reverse. Stores of N in the unsaturated zone combined with limited N monitoring in groundwater suggests that early detection is unlikely. Solutions for reducing off-site consequences are outlined and include management to prevent water and N leakage happening, capture of N before it reaches waterways or groundwater and low input systems including land retirement. For scientists interested in N fixation and biological mediation, future research areas include increasing the proportion of perennials in farming systems, better control of N supply and demand through improved technology and us of N fertiliser, use of nitrification inhibitors and studies of the potential for N immobilisation and reduction through denitrification, both within and below the root zone. Integrated management strategies that address environmental implications from point/micro-scale to paddock and catchment scales are needed as are considerations of other environmental consequences. Research priorities will change from maximising N fixation for profitability towards balancing profitability and environmental goals for more sustainable systems.

AB  - The use of fire to prepare agricultural areas is a technique still used by small farmers in eastern Amazon. This type of management changes the dynamics of soil nutrients, especially phosphorus, which constitutes the most limiting nutrient for crop production in tropical soils. This study was carried out to evaluate changes in phosphorus forms in an Argissolo Amarelo Distrofico (Ultisol) submitted to burning and trituration of secondary forest in eastern Amazon. The evaluated systems were: slash-and-burn of vegetation; slash-and-mulch of vegetation; and secondary vegetation. The labile, moderately labile, moderately recalcitrant, available and total phosphorus fractions were assessed at the soil depths of 0.00-0.05, 0.05-0.10 and 0.10-0.20 m. The results showed a predominance of soluble P in acid (moderately labile P) over other forms in all management systems. The management systems influence the content and distribution of the forms of P, where the slash-and-mulch system presented the prevalence of the labile fraction, and the slash-and-burn system contained less labile forms. The slash-and-mulch system favored the accumulation of labile P and total organic P.

AB  - Up to 75% of nitrogen (N) taken up during cauliflowers production is allocated to leaves, which are left as crop residues after harvest. The inclusion of cauliflower, cultivated alone or intercropped with legumes, in rotation schemes, is a promising tool to optimize N availability to subsequent crops. This original study assessed, for the first time in South Tyrol, Italy, the effect of removal or soil incorporation of cauliflower and clover residues on the growth and N uptake of subsequent lettuce. In 2015, cauliflower was sole-cropped or intercropped with clover, under different N regimes (N0, N1, N2, N3 = 0, 75, 150, 300 kg N ha(-1)). Cauliflower and clover residues were either removed or incorporated in the soil in 2016. The effects of the residual fertility left by the N fertilizer, the two cropping systems, and the crop residues were assessed on the yield and N uptake of two subsequent lettuce crops. Isotopic N-15-labeled cauliflower residues were additionally used to quantify the N contribution of cauliflower residues to lettuce growth. During the first lettuce crop, residues incorporation was the only factor increasing lettuce yields (+41%) and N uptake (+58%). The residual effect of N1 and N2 rates increased the lettuce N uptake when clover residues were incorporated. During the second lettuce crop, residues incorporation increased lettuce yields (+26%) and N uptake (+44%). On average, 64% and 35% of the lettuce N amounts, in the first and second cycles, respectively, derived from cauliflower residues, and accounted for 38% of the total N contained in cauliflower residues (214 kg N ha(-1)). Results from this experiment, uncommon for the examined species, demonstrate that incorporation of cauliflower and clover residues provides an excellent source of N for lettuce. Incorporating residues of the preceding cauliflower crop, alone or intercropped with clover, before establishing the lettuce crop, substantially reduce the N fertilization needs of subsequent lettuce crops.

AB  - Legumes build soil fertility and contribute substantial amounts of N for sustainability of cereal based cropping systems. These lacking information for the system as a whole in rainfed pothwar were investigated through field experiments at two different locations i.e. (Research farm of University of Arid Agriculture Rawalpindi, UAAR and farmer's fields in Chakwal district). Mung bean (Var. NM-92) and mash bean (Var. Mash-3) were rotated with wheat (Var. Wafaq 2001) with the objectives to assess N-2-fixation of these legumes and study their residual effects on soil NO3-N and subsequent wheat yield. Sorghum (Var. YSS-98) was also grown as non-legume reference crop. Mash bean not fertilized with P produced 4.27 t ha(-1) of dry matter compared with 4.38 t ha(-1) when fertilized with P @ 80 kg ha(-1). Similarly, mash bean fertilized with P yielded 4% more grain followed by mung bean and response of P fertilizer was 13%. Legumes N-2-fixed ranged from 13-80 and 18-38 kg ha(-1) at UAAR and Chakwal site, respectively. The NO3-N contents in the soil under non-legume sorghum were less compared with legumes. Maximum contents of total NO3-N, 58 kg ha(-1) in soil profile was observed under mash bean fertilized with P. Additional residual soil NO3-N under legumes relative to adjacent sorghum crop were 22 kg ha(-1) at UAAR site, 83 % higher when compared to Chakwal site. Both legumes with and with out P fertilization increased the biomass and grain yield of succeeding wheat with an increase of 18% over non-legume sorghum. Legumes-cereal sequence improved NO3-N status of soil as well as yield of subsequent wheat.

AB  - Nonpoint-source (NPS) or diffuse pollution is a major environmental problem in developed countries, and modeling is an important tool used to evaluate the effectiveness of pollution control measures. The use of NPS models in the tropics usually involves the application of models developed for temperate regions with little, if ally, adaptation to tropical conditions. In this article, we provide a synthesis of the literature values from studies in the tropics, using the GLEAMS model as a reference for the comparable values used in representing temperate conditions. We found that values for the carbon to nitrogen (C:N) ratio, potentially mineralizable nitrogen to total nitrogen ratio (N-0/N-total), and base NO3-N and NH4-N concentrations representative of tropical soils were all different from the values considered appropriate for temperate soils. Relationships between phosphorus pools in tropical soils and in phosphorus sorption parameters likewise were different from those used in GLEAMS, with the exception that the GLEAMS ratio between labile and organic phosphorus in highly weathered soils was found to be comparable to data specific for tropical soils.

AB  - Winter cover crops (WCCs) provide agronomic and environmental benefits, although their impacts on subsequent crop yields have been reported to vary across regions, soils, or under different farm practices. To address the variability in response, previous qualitative and quantitative reviews have summarized the overall yield effects of WCCs. However, the results from such reviews need constant revision as new research is published and interest in the conservation benefits of WCCs increases. Here, we update a previous meta-analysis of WCC effects on corn (Zea mays) yields, which summarized peer-reviewed research from the United Sates and Canada that was published between 1965 and 2004. Our updated data set (1965 to 2015) comprises 268 observations from 65 studies conducted in different regions of the United States and Canada, and includes information about the management practices utilized (i.e., WCC species, nitrogen [N] fertilization, termination date, tillage, etc.). The effect-size was the response ratio (RR), defined as corn yield following WCCs relative to yield after no cover crop (NC). As in the previous meta-analysis, our results showed a neutral to positive contribution of WCCs to corn yields. On average, grass WCCs neither increased nor decreased corn yields, although corn grown for grain yielded relatively higher than silage corn after grass WCCs. Legume WCCs resulted in subsequent higher corn yields by 30% to 33% when N fertilizer rates were low or the tillage system shifted from conventional tillage (CT) to no-tillage (NT). Mixture WCCs increased corn yields by 30% when the cover crop was late terminated (zero to six days before subsequent corn). Evidence of 65 years of research showed that uncertainty around the RR has decreased and corn yield response to WCCs has stabilized over time. Our results suggest that benefits of WCCs do not result in reduced corn productivity if properly managed.

AB  - On-farm adoption of minimum soil disturbance and increased residue retention will alter nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils and N fertiliser management in the intensive rice-based triple cropping systems of the Eastern Gangetic Plains. However, the consequences of changes in N forms, N mineralisation and its availability for crops have not been determined. Field experiments were conducted at two locations (Alipur and Digram) of north-west Bangladesh (NWB) to examine N cycling under three planting practices (conventional tillage (CT), strip planting (SP) and bed planting (BP)) with increased (HR) or low residue retention (LR- the current practice) on Calcareous Brown Flood Plain and Grey Terrace soils. Total N and available N were measured on soil samples as was N uptake by crops at different growth stages in the 13-14th (Alipur) and 12-13th (Digram) crops since treatments commenced. At each location (0-10 cm soil depth), SP, including non-puddled transplanting of rice seedlings (NP), together with HR increased total N by 9 and 32 % relative to BPHR, and CTHR and by 62 % relative to the current farm practice (CTLR). In general, the cumulative available N in soils during mustard and rice cropping under CT with HR was higher than other crop establishment and residue retention practices while under wheat and jute, total availability of N did not vary among crop establishment types with increased residue retention. Nitrogen availability in the initial phase of crop growth (0-60 DAS) was generally higher with CT than SP and BP. By contrast, for all crops, the estimated potentially mineralisable N was higher and its decay rate was lower under SPHR than other crop establishment and residue retention practices. Conservation Agriculture practices (SP, and NP of rice, together with HR) have altered the N cycling by reducing the level of mineral N available to plants in the early growing season when crop demand is low, but by increasing soil total N (0 -10 cm) and plant N uptake which enhanced the synchrony between crop demand and available N supply.

AB  - Including pulses in wheat-based cropping systems in semiarid regions may be a strategy for sustainably intensifying crop production. However, the impact of an increase in the frequency of pulse crops on soil bacterial communities is not known. We tested the hypothesis that increasing the frequency of pea, lentil and chickpea in 4-year crop rotation systems would cause corresponding shifts in the soil bacterial community. The first cycle of a field experiment was conducted in 2010-2013 and the second cycle, in 2011-2014. 16S rDNA amplicon pyrosequencing was performed to examine the rhizosphere bacterial communities following the third year (phase-3) of the rotations and root bacterial communities during the fourth year (phase-4), when all rotations were seeded to wheat. We found that three consecutive years of pulse crops modified the structure and increased the diversity of the rhizosphere bacterial community. Changes in community composition led to changes in eleven groups of KEGG pathways, including an increase in nitrogen metabolism and a shift in the production of secondary metabolites towards high production of nitrogenous alkaloids in systems with high pulse frequency. Pulse identity had little influence on bacterial communities; the effect of pulses was related to soil mineral nitrogen level, which increased with pulse frequency. High pulse frequency reduced bacterial diversity in wheat roots in the fourth year of the rotations. The only dominant wheat root-associated operational taxonomic unit (OTU) positively related with wheat yield was identified as Rhizobium. One of the two dominant OTUs negatively related with wheat yield was typical of rotation systems with a pulse frequency of <= 1. Phase-4 grain yield was related with soil mineral nitrogen level. The inclusion of nitrogen in the agroecosystem through biological nitrogen fixation seems to be an important part of the beneficial effect of including pulses in wheat-based rotations. The effect of pulse frequency on the structure and function of rhizobacteria communities and on wheat is mitigated by drought in the semiarid prairie.

AB  - As an important surface parameter, surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a significant role in water resources management, crop growth, land degradation, and vegetation coverage as well as global climate change studies. In particular, the triangle model based on the spatial relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index from optical/thermal infrared remote sensing data has been widely used for the estimation of SSM. In the present study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data, including the MOD11A2 LST and MOD13A2 normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) from July to October, 2008 to 2010, over the source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau, are selected to construct the LST/NDVI triangle space. Two methods based on the triangle space, namely, the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) method and second order polynomial method, is used to estimate the SSM at the regional scale. Finally, an analysis between the estimated SSM and ground-measured SSM is carried out to explore not only the quality of these two methods in triangle space but also the applicability of these two methods in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the spatial distribution of SSM in the study area is investigated. The results of the validation of the estimated SSM results using ground-measured data show that the accuracy of the second order polynomial method is significantly higher than that of the TVDI method. The TVDI method root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.072m(3)m(-3), coefficient of determination R-2 is 0.461, and bias is -0.022m(3)m(-3), while the second order polynomial method RMSE is 0.075m(3)m(-3), R-2 is 0.519, and bias is 0.007m(3)m(-3). Moreover, the SSM decreases from west to the east; this distribution can be obtained with the estimated results by using either of the two methods. In addition, the SSM estimations by using the two methods are in good correlation with the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product. The present study indicates that the second order polynomial method can simulate the change in SSM in the triangle space more realistically and effectively and that the second order polynomial method is more suitable for the estimation of SSM over the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau.

AB  - NDVI is a key factor for describing variations of vegetation covers. In this research, NDVI values from 15 subregions and the main stream of the Yellow River basin during 1982-1998 were obtained and analysed. The results indicated that their peak values were observed in July or August annually. Annual mean values of NDVI increased across the basin except in the San-Hua and Upper-long subregions, implying that vegetation covers in most of the Yellow River basin were increasing over the 17 years. Moreover, significant positive correlations existed between NDVI values and climatic factors except a certain degree of time lags.

AB  - In the semiarid interior of the Iberian Peninsula, the topographic insulation from the surrounding seas promotes the role of internal sources of moisture and water recycling in the rainfall regime. In inland Iberia, the annual cycle of precipitation often has a distinctive peak in the springtime, when evapotranspiration (ET) is the highest, in contrast to the coastal areas, where it is more closely related to the external moisture availability and synoptic forcing, with a maximum in winter-autumn and a pronounced minimum in the summer. In this work we investigate the role of land surface water fluxes in the intensification of the hydrological cycle in the Iberian spring. We used data from 5 km resolution WRF-ARW model simulations over the Iberian Peninsula for eleven months of May (2000-2010). To bring out the effect of ET fluxes, we conducted experiments where ET water over land was removed from the system. Our findings indicate that the impact of ET on precipitation is on average very large (37 % increase). The impact is particularly strong in the interior north and northeast areas where the observed annual rainfall cycle has a peak in May, suggesting that the role of surface water fluxes is very important there. To investigate whether this role is as a water source or to amplify precipitation dynamics, we computed the recycling ratio analytically from the model data. In addition, we developed a procedure to quantify the amplification impact by comparing the recycling ratio and the relative change in precipitation between control and experiments with ET removed. Results show that the role of surface water fluxes on precipitation depends on large-scale forcing and moisture advection. When the synoptic forcing and moisture advection are strong, such as in fronts associated to Atlantic storms, the impact of ET fluxes is small. When there is potential for convection, as is commonly the case of late spring in the Iberian Peninsula, ET fluxes have a significant impact. Surface moisture fluxes moisten the boundary layer and increase moist static energy, strengthening convective processes, and their role goes from being a primary water source for precipitation (recycling) to have mostly an amplification effect as external moisture availability increases. Our findings show that for the eleven simulated May cases over the Iberian Peninsula, the role of ET fluxes in activating recycling is important and explains 27-58 % of their total impact on precipitation, depending on the method used to calculate the recycling ratio. This indicates that the complementary effect of ET on amplifying rainfall from external sources of moisture is comparable in magnitude to the recycling mechanism and important as well.

AB  - Catchment heterogeneity leads to uncertainty about estimating timescales of storage and difficulty in extrapo-lating to larger scales. A heterogeneity-independent storage index (SI) was employed to build a connection with catchment characteristics, especially for landscapes, over six humid, forestry catchments. The SI is derived from the amplitudes of tracer cycles in precipitation and ephemeral/intermittent streamflow. The SI was significantly correlated with landscape metric (R2 = 0.81 and p = 0.014), specifically the fractal dimension index (FRAC) indicating the shape complexity of the landscape. Meanwhile, the topographic wetness index (TWI) (R2 = 0.77, p = 0.021) showed a close connection with the storage index as well. Close correlations suggested that the FRAC and TWI regulate the timescale of storage over the range of spatial scales, in particular the young water fraction in streams, because the SI is a heterogeneity-independent metric derived from seasonal tracer cycle amplitudes, which has a close relation to young water fraction. This also indicated the SI can be treated as an alternative travel-time metric and a reflection of the hydrological nature. Moreover, the findings implied the possibility of hydrological modeling over multiple spatial scales. The linkage between SI and landscape and topography provides insight into the mechanism of streamflow generation. Based on ephemeral streams, the crucial control of landscape and topography on the timescale of storage contributes to available water assessment and sus-tainable ecosystem management.

AB  - Intensive agricultural cultivation in hilly catchments is subject to significant environmental risks, because the local terrain and exceptionally fragile ecosystem usually promote high levels of nutrient loss. In order to assess such negative effects, we compared long-term (2012-2018) water quality dynamics of four ponds that are fed by runoff from agricultural hillsides with contrasting slopes and land cover near Tianmu Lake in Eastern China. Averaged total nitrogen (TN) levels in ponds increased from 7.0 mg L-1 to 10.0 mg L-1 when the cultivated slopes above them doubled from 8 degrees to 16 degrees. In contrast, total phosphorus (TP) levels varied modestly from 0.05 to 0.07 mg L-1 among the four ponds. Values were lower when drained hillslopes had good vegetation coverage and/or buffer strips. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicated that relatively high precipitation is the determining factor for N loss from gentle hillsides, but as slope gradients increase, the frequency of rainfall events becomes the major influential factor. TP loss was associated with strong rainfall events and can be greatly reduced if hillsides are well covered with vegetation. When vegetation cover is removed, nutrient loss, especially N, is heightened. Our results underscore the significance of agricultural cultivation of steep hillsides in exacerbating N and P pollution and highlight the value of forests and grasslands in reducing nutrient loss from these sensitive areas. An integrated strategy that includes controlling land exploitation, source control, delivery interception, and pond management should be considered to minimize nutrient loss in hilly areas prone to rapid agricultural expansion.

AB  - With the significant advancements in Information and Communications Technology (ICT), cloud based applications provide a novel approach to access applications which are not installed on the local computers. The integration of cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) indicated a bright future of the Internet. In this paper, a new architecture of cloud computing Model as a Service (MaaS) is proposed. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is proved by implementing a groundwater model on cloud as a case study. The groundwater model is established using MODFLOW for the middle reach of the Heihe River Basin (HRB). The model is calibrated using in situ observation to ensure capability of simulating the groundwater process with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 m and coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.64. The parameter uncertainties of the groundwater model are analyzed by sequential data assimilation algorithms (PF, Particle Filter; EnKF, Ensemble Kalman Filter) in a synthetic case. The results show that the parameter uncertainties are effectively reduced by incorporating observed information recursively. A comparison between PF and EnKF indicate that the results from PF are slightly better than those from EnKF. The integration shows a bright future for simulating the groundwater system in realtime. This study provides a flexible and effective approach for analyzing the uncertainties and time variant properties of the parameters and the proposed architecture of cloud computing provides a novel approach for the researchers and decision -makers to construct numerical models and follow-up researches.

AB  - Ammonia (NH3) loss following manure application is an environmental concern and N loss for crop production. Manure injection typically reduces NH3 loss compared to surface application without incorporation but increases emissions of nitrous oxide (N2O), which is a potent greenhouse gas. Synchronizing manure in spring with cover crop (CC) growth may increase N recovery and reduce N2O emissions compared to applying manure later in the absence of growing crops. We compared the two following manure application methods: shallow-disk injection (IM) or surface banding without incorporation (BM) to annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) CC at two times: early spring on growing CC (EARLY) and late spring on terminated CC (LATE). The randomized split-plot block experiment was conducted at Rock Springs, PA, during 2021-2022. After manure application, we measured NH3 for 72 h and N2O throughout the growing season. Aboveground CC biomass, N, and C:N ratio; pre-sidedress soil nitrate; corn (Zea mays L.) stalk nitrate; and silage yield were assessed. Averaged across application times, compared to BM, IM reduced cumulative NH3 loss, increased soil N, and resulted in 13% greater corn yield but increased yield-scaled N2O. Compared to BM LATE, BM EARLY reduced NH3 loss by 43%, increased CC N, reduced N2O emission by 50%, but decreased corn yield by 11%. When IM was EARLY compared to LATE, CC N increased 84%, cumulative N2O loss decreased 55%, and corn yield was similar. Injecting manure to growing CCs offers a strategy for reducing detrimental NH3 and N2O emissions and maintaining corn yield.

AB  - An experiment was conducted to study the influences of nitrification inhibitor (NI) and biochar incorporation on yield-scaled N2O using the static chamber method and gas chromatography in an intensively managed vegetable field with seven consecutive vegetable crops from 2012 to 2014 in southeastern China With an equal annual nitrogen (N) application rate (1217 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)), six treatments under three biochar amendment rates namely, 0 tha(-1) (CO), 20 t ha(-1) (Cl) and 40 t ha(-1) (C2) with compound fertilizer (CF) or urea mixed with NI of nitrapyrin as chlorinated pyridine (CP) were studied in these field experiments. The results showed that, although there was no significant influence on soil organic carbon (SOC) content or total nitrogen (TN), nitrapyrin could result in a significant increase in soil pH during the experimental period. Nitrapyrin significantly decreased cumulative N2O emissions by 15.9-32.1 % while increasing vegetable yield by 9.8-41.9 %. Thus, it also decreased yield-scaled N2O emissions significantly. In addition to the differential responses of the soil pH, biochar amendment significantly increased SOC and TN. Compared with the treatments without biochar addition, the cumulative N2O emissions showed no significant difference in the CF or the CP group treatments but increased slightly (not significantly) by 7.9-18.3 % in the CP group treatments. Vegetable yield was enhanced by 7.1-49.5% in the CF group treatments compared with the treatments without biochar amendment, while there was no significant difference in the CP group treatments, and the yield-scaled N2O emissions were thus decreased significantly. Furthermore, treatments involving with nitrapyrin and biochar incorporation slightly increased yield-scaled N2O emissions by 9.4 %, on average, compared with CP-CO. Therefore, the application of nitrapyrin could serve as an appropriate practice for increasing vegetable yield and mitigating N2O emissions in intensively managed vegetable fields and should be further examined in various agroecosystems.

AB  - Climate-driven tree mortality has increased globally in response to warmer temperature and more severe drought. To examine how tree mortality in semiarid biomes impacts surface water balance, we experimentally manipulated a pinon-juniper (PJ) woodland by girdling all adult pinon trees in a 4 ha area, decreasing pinon basal area by similar to 65%. Over 3.5 years (2009-2013), we compared water flux measurements from this girdled site with those from a nearby intact PJ woodland. Before and after girdling, the ratio of evapotranspiration (ET) to incoming precipitation was similar between the two sites. Girdling altered the partitioning of ET such that the contribution of canopy transpiration to ET decreased 9-14% over the study period, relative to the intact control, while noncanopy ET increased. We attributed the elevated noncanopy ET in the girdled site each year to winter increases in sublimation and summer increases in both soil evaporation and below-canopy transpiration. Although we expected that mortality of a canopy dominant would increase the availability of water and other resources to surviving vegetation, we observed a decrease in both soil volumetric water content and sap flow rates in the remaining trees at the girdled site, relative to the control. This postgirdling decrease in the performance of the remaining trees occurred during the severe 2011-2012 drought, suggesting that pinon mortality may trigger feedback mechanisms that leave PJ woodlands drier relative to undisturbed sites and potentially more vulnerable to drought.

AB  - This paper assesses the extent to which a topographically defined description of the spatial arrangement of catchment wetness can be used to represent landscape hydrological connectivity in temperate river catchments. A physically based distributed hydrological model is used to characterize the space-time patterns of surface overland flow connection to the drainage network. These characterizations are compared with a static descriptor of the spatial structure of topographically controlled local wetness, called here the Network Index. Theoretically, if topography is the primary control upon hydrological response, the level of catchment wetness required to maintain connectivity along a flow path should be greater for flow paths that have a lower value of the topographically controlled local wetness. We find that our static descriptor can be used to generalize a significant proportion of the time-averaged spatial variability in connectivity, in terms of both the propensity to and duration of connection. Although the extent to which this finding holds will vary with the extent of topographic control of hydrological response, in catchments with relatively shallow soils and impervious geology our index could improve significantly the estimation of the transfer of sediment and dissolved materials to the drainage network and so assist with both diffuse pollution and climate change impact studies. The work also provides a second reason for the concept that there are Critical Source Areas in river catchments: these arise from the extent to which that material can be delivered to the drainage network, as well as the generation of risky material itself.

AB  - Crop sensing technologies to aid nitrogen management in grain crops have been the focus of an important element of Precision/Digital Agriculture research. We review sensor-based application research to explore the outcomes from this technology and provide guidelines for future developments in its application. Most studies report N fertilizer savings of 5-45% with little effect on grain yield, but a lack of consistent evidence of economic benefits limits adoption by farmers. Reported impacts on profit usually ranged between losses of US$ 30 ha(-1) and profits of US$ 70 ha(-1), with an overall average profit of US$ 30 ha(-1); about 25% of studies reported economic losses from sensor-based N applications. Sensor-based N applications which reduced environmental impacts were often not profitable compared to current N practices. Some methodological aspects of the research have also made interpretation of the benefits difficult as the value of the information used to recommend N rates and improved agronomy was often confounded with the value of sensor-based variable rate technology itself. Traditional plot experiments adopted in most studies are not the ideal method to evaluate variable rate technologies implemented to accommodate the effects of spatial variability. Neither simple fertilizer redistribution functions nor calibrated sensor algorithms, with or without the use of reference N-rich strips, were necessarily successful across a range of field conditions. New approaches to sensor-based site-specific N management are needed and it is likely the best approaches will arise from the use of multiple sensors.

AB  - Recent advances in measuring and modeling root water uptake along with refined electrical petrophysical models may help fill the existing gap in hydrological root model parametrization. In this paper, we discuss the choices to be made to combine root-zone hydrology and geoelectrical data with the aim of characterizing the active root zone. For each model and observation type we discuss sources of uncertainty and how they are commonly addressed in a stochastic inversion framework. We point out different degrees of integration in the existing hydrogeophysical approaches to parametrize models of root-zone hydrology. This paper aims at giving emphasis to stochastic approaches, in particular to Data Assimilation (DA) schemes, that are generally identified as the best way to combine geoelectrical data with Root Water Uptake (RWU) models. In addition, the study points out a more suitable objective function taken from the optimal transport theory that better captures complex geometry of root systems. Another pathway for improvement of geoelectrical data integration into RWU models using DA relies on the use of stem based methods as a leverage to introduce more extensive root knowledge into RWU macroscopic hydrological models.

AB  - The importance of positive interactions between species within natural ecosystems and species associated with traditional agriculture is well recognized. However, modern agriculture generally depends on monocultures, where positive interactions between cultivated species (ie in which the presence of one species facilitates the survival, growth, or reproduction of other species) are largely ignored. Here, we review recent studies focused on the positive interactions between cultivated species, consider how three traditional agricultural systems (legume-cereal intercropping, rice-fish co-culture, and agroforestry) have benefited from such interactions, and examine how these benefits are affected by climate, planting patterns, and field management. Finally, we propose a framework to illustrate how these interactions may improve modern agriculture through: the selection of species-species partnerships; the development of specialized field machinery (in each case); field structure and configuration; field management; and farmer and societal acceptance.

AB  - Information on water availability in basins can be crucial for making decisions for effective water resource management in basins. As the operation of hydrometric stations in Korea is mainly focused on flood season and large rivers, most basins have lack or no observed data. Consequently, this complicates water resource planning and management. Remote sensing data is emerging as a powerful alternative to hydrological information in ungauged basins. This study investigated the applicability of Satellite-Remote Sensed Data (SRSD) as a source for model calibration in Prediction in Ungauged Basins (PUB) through modeling. Remote sensed leaf area index (LAI), actual evapotranspiration, and soil moisture data were used. Each SRSD was used alone to calibrate a hydrologic model to predict the daily streamflow for 28 basins in Korea. A vegetation module was added to the existing hydrologic model to use LAI. Among the SRSDs tested, the model calibrated with LAI had the most robust performance, predicting streamflow with acceptable accuracy compared to the traditional calibration based on streamflow. In particular, since the model account for vegetation actively interacting with evapotranspiration and soil moisture in the season of low flow, the LAI-calibrated model showed an advantage in improving the flow prediction performance. Although further research is required to utilize evapotranspiration and soil moisture data, the overall results of the LAI-based calibration were promising for predicting streamflow in ungauged basins where observations are scarce or absent, given that the satellite-derived LAI data were used alone without any preprocessing such as a bias correction. However, the prediction performance of the LAI-calibrated model was found to have a statistically significant relationship with local conditions. Therefore, by evaluating and improving the potential of SRSD in different region and climatic conditions, it is expected that the application of the SRSD-only calibration method can be extended to various ungauged basins.

AB  - Pastoral systems are the dominant livestock production system in arid and semiarid regions of sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). They are often the only form of agriculture that can be practiced due to unfavorable climate and soil fertility levels that prevent crop cultivation. Pastoralism can have negative impacts on the environment, including land degradation, greenhouse gas emissions and other gases to the atmosphere, soil erosion, water pollution and biodiversity loss. Here, we review the current knowledge on nitrogen (N) cycling, storage, and loss pathways, with an emphasis on identification of N emission hotspots. Our review reports a large uncertainty in the amount of N lost as ammonia from excreta and manure storage, as well as N losses via nitrate and DON leaching. We also found that another major N loss pathway (18%), soil N-2 emissions, has not yet been measured. In order to summarize the available information, we use a virtual pastoral farm, with characteristics and management practices obtained from a real farm, Kapiti Research Station in Kenya. For outlining N flows at this virtual farm, we used published data, data from global studies, satellite imagery and geographic information system (GIS) tools. Our results show that N inputs in pastoral systems are dominated by atmospheric N deposition (similar to 80%), while inputs due to biological nitrogen fixation seems to play a smaller role. A major N loss pathway is nitrogen leaching (nitrate > DON) from pastures (33%). Cattle enclosures (bomas), where animals are kept during night, represent N emissions hotspots, representing 16% of the total N losses from the system. N losses via ammonia volatilization and N2O were four and three orders of magnitude higher from bomas than from the pasture, respectively. Based on our results, we further identify future research requirements and highlight the urgent need for experimental data collection to quantify nitrogen losses from manure in animal congregation areas. Such information is needed to improve our understanding on N cycling in pastoral systems in semiarid regions and to provide practical recommendations for managers that can help with decision-making on management strategies in pastoral systems in semiarid savannas.

AB  - The global impact of agriculture has recently become a major research topic, stressed by the rapid growth of the world population. Agriculture management is indeed influencing the quality of water, air, soil, and biodiversity at the global scale. The main agricultural challenges have already been reviewed, but these reviews did not discuss in detail the adaptations of agricultural techniques to global issues and the research challenges for agronomy. Here, we propose a research planning for global agronomy including the following advices. Agronomists should update their research objects, methods, and tools to address global issues. Yield trends and variations among various regions should be analyzed to understand the sources of these variations. Crop model simulations should be upscaled to estimate potential yields and to assess the effect of climate change and resource scarcity at the global scale. Advanced methods should analyze output uncertainty of complex models used at a global scale. Indeed various global models are actually used, but these models are too complex and the output uncertainty is difficult to analyze. The meta-analysis of published data is a promising approach for addressing global issues, though meta-analysis must be applied carefully with appropriate techniques. Finally, global datasets on the performance and environmental impact of cropping systems should be developed to allow agronomists to identify promising cropping systems.

AB  - Organic wheat and small grains are produced on relatively few acres in the inland Pacific Northwest. The objective of this study was to examine how the nitrogen (N) dynamics of cropping systems (CSs) produced during the transition phase impacted organic wheat yield and protein levels in the first 2 years of certified organic production. Certified organic spring wheat (SW) was produced in 2006 and winter wheat (WW) in 2007 following nine, 3-year transitional cereal, small grain and legume-intensive CSs. SW and WW following perennial alfalfa + oat/pea forage or 3 years of legume green manure tended to be more productive than wheat that followed systems that contained a small grain crop for at least 1 year during the transition. In addition to increasing soil N, well-established stands of forage and green manure provided adequate cover to reduce weed establishment prior to organic production. Effective weed control strategies were as important as increasing soil inorganic N levels for improving organic wheat production. Choice of crop type, cultivar and rotation is important in organic wheat systems and in this study, WW had better stand establishment, competition with weeds and higher overall yield than SW and would be a better-suited class of wheat for organic production in situations where spring weeds are the dominant problem. Regardless of CS or crop type, supplemental soil fertility (primarily N) during the organic production phase will be necessary to maintain high soil N levels and wheat yields in these dryland systems.

AB  - An attempt was made in this study to assess the indigenous composition (slow and fast-growers) of soybean-rhizobia, their symbiotic efficiency and nitrogen fixation in Vertisols of Madhya Pradesh under different cropping systems. The soils were collected from soybean-based (soybean-wheat and soybean-chickpea) and cereal-based (maize-wheat, rice-wheat and maize-chickpea) systems during 2013-15 from two agro climatic zones of the state. One of the sampling sites was under Long Term Fertilizer Experiment with soybean-wheat system where three treatments - absolute control, recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) and RDF+FYM were considered. Ratio of fast-growing soybean rhizobia was more in those cropping systems where soybean was one of the crops while population of slow-growers was more with cereal-cereal or maize-chickpea cropping systems. Nodulation and N symbiotic efficiency (N content and uptake) was better with slowgrowing rhizobia as compared to fast-growing. Maximum SOC was found at maximum vegetative growth stage in soybeanwheat rotation (5.7 g kg(-1) soil) under RDF+FYM and minimum (3 2 g kg(-1) soil) in absolute control. Available soil N was more in kharif season with soybean. Legume based systems and rabi season reflected better conversion of NH4+ to NO3--N.

AB  - Despite the many advantages of sustainable intensification (SI), the level of adoption of SI practices in African smallholding farms is still very low, highlighting the need for adequate methods for monitoring farm sustain ability. Research on SI and related poverty alleviation strategies focus either on the "problems" or on the "solutions" for agricultural livelihood systems (ALS) with separate sets of indicators developed accordingly. Bridging the two approaches, we propose an indicator set to assess the criticality of a resource to ALSs in order to support smallholders, decision-makers, and practitioners in the process of SI. The set indicates what problems an ALS faces in the form of resource supply risks and the ALS's ability to successfully cope with such problems, i.e., how resilient it is to these supply risks. We apply the ALS criticality approach (ALSCA) to macronutrients in three different ALS types in the village cluster of Pontieba, Ioba Province, Burkina Faso. Two criticality indicators are highlighted. First, the three ALS types are not facing equal nitrogen supply risks, when the latter is informed by depletion time. The depletion time indicates the time until which a resource stock is depleted at the current mining rate. The average depletion time of soil nitrogen stocks ranges from some 10 to 165 years. Second, the reliance on own resources is an indicator measuring resilience to supply restriction. In Pontieba, regardless of macronutrient, reliance on own nutrients never surpasses 50% when ALS averages are considered. The study showed that the ALSCA can contribute to the implementation of SI practices through support at four levels: 1) providing a holistic view on the ALS to avoid problem-shifting and enable prioritization, 2) providing options to reduce resource criticality, 3) mutual learning between ALSCA practitioners and smallholder farmers through knowledge integration, and 4) facilitating policy coherence from local to national levels thanks to the ALSCA's applicability on different scales.

AB  - Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for understanding terrestrial energy, water, and carbon cycles. This study proposes a hybrid model integrating in-situ and remote sensing-derived soil moisture (SM) observations and remote sensing leaf area index (LAI) with the Noah-MP model. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approach updates the leaf biomass and specific leaf area (SLA) by assimilating the remotely sensed LAI. A machine learning (ML) surrogate model is used to integrate multi-site SM profile observations and remote sensing SM products to estimate the three-layer SM. An iterative coupling of two parts implements the hybrid model: optimization of leaf biomass and SLA by assimilation of LAI in the Noah-MP model and simulation of three-layer SM in the ML surrogate model. The performance of the hybrid model is evaluated in the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in northwest China. The estimated ET from the hybrid model is compared with observations from the large aperture scintillometer (LAS) at the Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao sites and up-scaled watershed ET over the HRB. The findings indicate that the hybrid model performs well in vegetated areas but underestimates ET in extreme arid deserts. The three-site unbiased root mean squared errors (ubRMSEs) of ET estimates from the hybrid model are 29.06%, 42.76%, and 50.00% lower than Noah-MP at the Arou, Daman, and Sidaoqiao sites, respectively. The coupling of data assimilation (DA) and ML methods can improve vegetation dynamics and SM transport estimation in the Noah-MP model. The hybrid model can take advantage of DA and ML methods and integrate multi-source observations to improve the accuracy of ET estimation. The results also indicate that the ET predictions are more sensitive to root zone SM (0-40 cm) over croplands, grasslands, and shrublands, while the ET simulations are more affected by deeper rooting depths SM (0-100 cm) and groundwater over forests.

AB  - Random forests (RF) is a supervised machine learning algorithm, which has recently started to gain prominence in water resources applications. However, existing applications are generally restricted to the implementation of Breiman's original algorithm for regression and classification problems, while numerous developments could be also useful in solving diverse practical problems in the water sector. Here we popularize RF and their variants for the practicing water scientist, and discuss related concepts and techniques, which have received less attention from the water science and hydrologic communities. In doing so, we review RF applications in water resources, highlight the potential of the original algorithm and its variants, and assess the degree of RF exploitation in a diverse range of applications. Relevant implementations of random forests, as well as related concepts and techniques in the R programming language, are also covered.

AB  - In remote sensing (RS), shadows play an important role, commonly affecting the quality of data recorded by remote sensors. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance to detect and model the shadow effect in RS data as well as the information that is obtained from them, particularly when the data are to be used in further environmental studies. Shadows can generally be categorized into four types based on their sources: cloud shadows, topographic shadows, urban shadows, and a combination of these. The main objective of this study was to review the recent literature on the shadow effect in remote sensing. A systematic literature review was employed to evaluate studies published since 1975. Various studies demonstrated that shadows influence significantly the estimation of various properties by remote sensing. These properties include vegetation, impervious surfaces, water, snow, albedo, soil moisture, evapotranspiration, and land surface temperature. It should be noted that shadows also affect the outputs of remote sensing processes such as spectral indices, urban heat islands, and land use/cover maps. The effect of shadows on the extracted information is a function of the sensor-target-solar geometry, overpass time, and the spatial resolution of the satellite sensor imagery. Meanwhile, modeling the effect of shadow and applying appropriate strategies to reduce its impacts on various environmental and surface biophysical variables is associated with many challenges. However, some studies have made use of shadows and extracted valuable information from them. An overview of the proposed methods for identifying and removing the shadow effect is presented.

AB  - A field experiment was conducted on continuous barley to evaluate the effects of 3 beef cattle winter feeding systems (bale grazing (BG); swath grazing (SG); straw-chaff grazing (STCH)) and pen manure and compost application on soil N and P amounts and distribution, soil density and barley crop biomass. Cattle winter feeding systems were managed during the winter of 2005-2006. Effects of extensive winter feeding system on soil nutrients and soil density were determined in the spring of 2006 after winter feeding. Nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) amounts at the low slope position in the 0-15 cm depth were 53% higher (P < 0.10) on BG sites than STCH sites. This may be attributed to the larger concentration of feed, thus feed nutrients, in the BG wintering system. Phosphorus amounts on the BG wintering sites at high slope were 34% higher (P < 0.10) than amounts at the same slope on the SG or STCH sites. Soil density was 21% greater (P < 0.10) where cows BG compared to where cows grazed straw-chaff piles, indicating differences in soil strength and resistance to penetration by roots. Soil density decreased on compost and raw manure sites in comparison to where no manure was applied, thus validating the benefits of manure on soil structure. Crop biomass measured on BG sites was consistent with soil nutrients captured, resulting in a 15% greater (P < 0.10) total biomass compared to STCH and SG wintering sites. Soil nutrient and crop biomass distribution was consistent among winter feeding sites with the STCH sites having the most uniform distribution of nutrients and crop biomass, and the BG sites having the least. Managing manure nutrients from winter feeding systems can be beneficial when followed by an annual cropping system.

AB  - The Earth's population will become more than 80% urban during this century. This threshold is often regarded as sufficient justification for pursuing urban ecology. However, pursuit has primarily focused on building empirical richness, and urban ecology theory is rarely discussed. The Baltimore Ecosystem Study (BES) has been grounded in theory since its inception and its two decades of data collection have stimulated progress toward comprehensive urban theory. Emerging urban ecology theory integrates biology, physical sciences, social sciences, and urban design, probes interdisciplinary frontiers while being founded on textbook disciplinary theories, and accommodates surprising empirical results. Theoretical growth in urban ecology has relied on refined frameworks, increased disciplinary scope, and longevity of interdisciplinary interactions. We describe the theories used by BES initially, and trace ongoing theoretical development that increasingly reflects the hybrid biological-physical-social nature of the Baltimore ecosystem. The specific mix of theories used in Baltimore likely will require modification when applied to other urban areas, but the developmental process, and the key results, will continue to benefit other urban social-ecological research projects.

AB  - Extending the grazing season by maintaining beef cattle on pasture in the fall/winter has been adopted by many producers on the Prairies as it reduces the need for mechanical harvesting and can lower labour and manure management costs relative to feeding cattle in confinement. Annual and perennial forages, alone or in combination, offer the potential for low-input grazing while maintaining animal productivity. Using a range of data sources, this paper will review the methods available for extending the grazing season of beef cattle using annual and perennial forages and discuss level of adoption and the practical implications and considerations for producers. These methods included stockpile grazing, bale grazing, swath grazing, and corn grazing, with the suitability of methods based on a range of factors including the nutritive requirements of the target class of cattle, environmental conditions, and costs of inputs. In an effort to maximise the efficiency of maintaining cattle on pasture in the fall/winter period, the ability to be flexible and adaptive to changing climatic and economic conditions within and between years is essential. Furthermore, a combination of the aforementioned methods may be employed in an integrated effort to enhance the productivity and sustainability of overwintering of beef cattle.

AB  - Purpose Several models are available in the literature to estimate agricultural emissions. From life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective, there is no standardized procedure for estimating emissions of nitrogen or other nutrients. This article aims to compare four agricultural models (PEF, SALCA, Daisy and Animo) with different complexity levels and test their suitability and sensitivity in LCA. Methods Required input data, obtained outputs, and main characteristics of the models are presented. Then, the performance of the models was evaluated according to their potential feasibility to be used in estimating nitrogen emissions in LCA using an adapted version of the criteria proposed by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and other relevant studies, to judge their suitability in LCA. Finally, nitrogen emissions from a case study of irrigated maize in Spain were estimated using the selected models and were tested in a full LCA to characterize the impacts. Results and discussion According to the set of criteria, the models scored, from best to worst: Daisy (77%), SALCA (74%), Animo (72%) and PEF (70%), being Daisy the most suitable model to LCA framework. Regarding the case study, the estimated emissions agreed to literature data for the irrigated corn crop in Spain and the Mediterranean, except N2O emissions. The impact characterization showed differences of up to 56% for the most relevant impact categories when considering nitrogen emissions. Additionally, an overview of the models used to estimate nitrogen emissions in LCA studies showed that many models have been used, but not always in a suitable or justified manner. Conclusions Although mechanistic models are more laborious, mainly due to the amount of input data required, this study shows that Daisy could be a suitable model to estimate emissions when fertilizer application is relevant for the environmental study. In addition, and due to LCA urgently needing a solid methodology to estimate nitrogen emissions, mechanistic models such as Daisy could be used to estimate default values for different archetype scenarios.

AB  - The cultivation of Chinese milk vetch (MV) as green manure is an effective practice for improving paddy soil fertility and rice yields in China. However, few studies have investigated the effects of MV on phosphorus (P) availability and the risk of P loss. An 11-year field experiment was conducted to analyze the effects of returning MV to paddy soil on soil P forms, late rice yield and soil fertility, as well as the related mechanisms. The experiment included seven treatments: (1) F0M0 (no-fertilizer and no-MV); (2) F1M0 (chemical fertilizer alone), (3) F2M0 (70% of chemical fertilizer), and F2MV1-4 (70% of chemical fertilizer and 7500 kg ha-1 MV, 15000 kg ha-1 MV, 22500 kg ha-1 MV, 30000 kg ha-1 MV). The Olsen-P of F2M1-4 were significantly higher (38.3-54.5%) than that of F2M0 and the CaCl2-P levels of F2M1-4 were significantly lower (47.7-61.6%) than that of F1M0. The Olsen-P was mainly influenced by soil total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), pH, free Fe/Al (FeDCB/ AlDCB), organic bound Fe (Feo), noncrystalline amorphous Al (Alox) and exchange Mg2+, while the CaCl2-P was mainly influenced by TP, pH Alox, FeDCB, AlDCB, and exchange Mg2+/Ca2+. Partial least squares path model analysis indicated that chemical fertilizer played more important role on the Olsen-P and the CaCl2-P. MV application had the negative effect (the total effect value-0.48) on the CaCl2-P and decreased the risk of P loss yet. Two-segment regression analyses indicated the critical Olsen-P levels were 19.39 mg kg-1 for late rice yield and 31.94 mg kg-1 for soluble P, respectively. In conclusion, the continuous application of MV not only improved P availability to enhance late rice yield, but also reduced the risk of P loss in paddy soil in double rice systems.

AB  - Introduction: Agricultural activities in the North China Plain are often challenged by inadequate irrigation and nutrient supply. Inadequate and improper resource utilization may impose negative impacts on agricultural sustainability. To counteract the negative impacts, a deeper understanding of the different resource management strategies is an essential prerequisite to assess the resource saving potential of crops. Methods: We explored plausible adaptation strategies including drip irrigation lateral spacings of 40 and 80 cm (hereafter referred to as LS40 and LS80, respectively), irrigating winter wheat after soil water consumption of 20 and 35 mm (hereafter represented as IS20 and IS35, respectively), and nitrogen fertilization scheme of a) applying 50% nitrogen as a basal dose and 50% as a top-dressing dose (NS50:50), b) 25% nitrogen as a basal dose and 75% as a topdressing dose (NS25:75), and c) no nitrogen application as a basal dose and 100% application as a top-dressing dose (NS0:100). Results and discussion: The consecutive 2 years (2017-2018 and 2018-2019) of field study results show that growing winter wheat under LS40 enhanced the water use efficiency (WUE), grain yield, 1,000-grain weight, and number of grains per spike by 15.04%, 6.95%, 5.67%, and 21.59% during the 2017-2018 season, respectively. Additionally, the corresponding values during the 2018-2019 season were 12.70%, 7.17%, 2.66%, and 19.25%, respectively. Irrigation scheduling of IS35 treatment improved all the growth-related and yield parameters of winter wheat. Further, treating 25% nitrogen as a basal dose and application of 75% as a top-dressing dose positively influenced the winter wheat yield. While NS0:100 increased the plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and aboveground biomass as compared to the other application strategies, but high nitrogen was observed in deeper soil layers. Regarding soil environment, the lowest soil moisture and nitrate nitrogen contents were observed in LS80 during both growing seasons. Overall, coupling the IS35 with NS25:75 under 40-cm lateral spacing is a suitable choice for sustainable winter wheat production in theNorth China Plain. The results of our study may be helpful in advancing the knowledge of the farmer community for winter wheat production. The findings can also aid in advancing new insights among scientists working on soil water and nitrogen distribution in drip irrigation for better productivity.

AB  - High energy consumption and carbon emission are the major components of environmental pollution. Reducing carbon-footprints and improving energy use efficiency in rice (Oryza sativa L.) -fallow production systems of South Asia is a great challenge. The present experiment was conducted for five consecutive years (2016-2020) with an aim to design the most carbon-cum-energy efficient, cleaner/safer and eco-friendly production systems for rice-fallows in eastern India. This split-plot experiment had crop establishment-cum-residue management (CERM) treatments in main-plots and post-rainy/winter season crops in sub-plots. The production systems selected for analysis included three crop establishment methods [(1) zero -till-direct-seeded rice (ZTDSR), (2) conventional-till direct-seeded rice (CTDSR), and (3) transplanted puddled rice (TPR)], and two residue management practices [(i) with residue, and (ii) without residue] in combination with five potential winter season crops i.e., chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), lentil (Lens culinaris L.), safflower (Carthamus tinctorius L.), linseed (Linum usitatissimum L.), and mustard (Brassica juncea L.). Results revealed an increase in overall system productivity from 3.5 to 5.13 Mg ha(-1) due to the diversification of rice-fallow systems with oilseed and pulse crops. Irrespective of residue management practices, ZTDSR increased the yield by 15 and 31% in chickpea, 15 and 34% in lentil, 33 and 50% in safflower, 9 and 19% in linseed, and 7 and 15% in mustard as compared to CTDSR and PTR, respectively. Moreover, adoption of ZTDSR reduced energy uses by 23.3%, while increased energy ratio and net returns by 14.3 and 10.9%, respectively, over TPR. Pulse based crop rotations (rice -lentil and rice -chickpea) under ZTDSR with surface crop residue yielded 21.5% higher system net returns as compared to rice-oilseed production systems. ZTDSR treatment also reduced carbon-footprint (C-footprint) by 2.8% compared to TPR-based production systems. Similarly, rice-oilseed systems had a 16.1% lower C-footprint in comparison to rice-pulse sequences. Hence, rice-chickpea, rice-lentil and rice-safflower production systems in combined with ZTDSR along with residue retention can be viable production systems with higher system productivity, better economic returns, higher energy ratio and lower C-footprint. These systems will ensure an efficient utilization of natural resources leading to long-term sustainability of the rice-fallow production systems of South Asia.

AB  - Rice is the most important food crop in Asia, and the timely mapping and monitoring of paddy rice fields subsequently emerged as an important task in the context of food security and modelling of greenhouse gas emissions. Rice growth has a distinct influence on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) backscatter images, and time-series analysis of C-band images has been successfully employed to map rice fields. The poor data availability on regional scales is a major drawback of this method. We devised an approach to classify paddy rice with the use of all available Envisat ASAR WSM (Advanced Synthetic Aperture Radar Wide Swath Mode) data for our study area, the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. We used regression-based incidence angle normalization and temporal averaging to combine acquisitions from multiple tracks and years. A crop phenology-based classifier has been applied to this time series to detect single-, double- and triple-cropped rice areas (one to three harvests per year), as well as dates and lengths of growing seasons. Our classification has an overall accuracy of 85.3% and a kappa coefficient of 0.74 compared to a reference dataset and correlates highly with official rice area statistics at the provincial level (R-2 of 0.98). SAR-based time-series analysis allows accurate mapping and monitoring of rice areas even under adverse atmospheric conditions.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of addition of pulses in crop sequences, crop residue management, and application of fertilizer N on soil nitrogen content, soil organic carbon, nutrient uptake, and its consequences for wheat yields. The field experiments were carried out from 2009 to 2012 in the sub-humid and sub-tropical zone of northern India. The treatments were (i) crop residue retained (+Residue) or (ii) removed (-Residue), (iii) 120 kg N ha(-1) applied to wheat, (iv) 150 kg N ha(-1) to maize, and (v) a control with no nitrogen applied to either wheat or maize. The cropping systems consisted of a rotation of wheat and maize or wheat and green gram. Postharvest incorporation of crop residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased the wheat grain and straw yields during 2010-2011 and 2011-2012. On average, crop residues incorporation increased the wheat grain yield by a factor of 1.31 and straw yield by 1.38. The wheat crop also responded strongly to the previous legume (green gram); grain yield increased by a factor of 1.89 and straw yield by 2.05, compared to the control. Application of fertilizer N to the preceding maize crop exerted a strong carryover effect on grain (1.18) and straw yield (1.26) wheat. Application of N fertilizer to wheat increased grain and straw yields by, respectively, a factor of 1.69 and 1.79 on average. The overall conclusion is that an improved crop residue management, combined with application of fertilizer N or incorporation of legumes greatly improves the N economy of cereal cropping systems and enhances crop productivity in soils with a low N content on the short term.

AB  - Storm water detention tanks are widely used for the control of combined sewer overflows. Conventional continuous simulation and recently developed analytical probabilistic models have been used for analyzing the hydrologic operation of storm water detention tanks. These analyses are necessary in order to accurately estimate the runoff capture efficiency of a given control system or the required storage capacity for achieving a desired runoff capture efficiency. The analytical probabilistic models still have the shortcomings of making simplifying assumptions about the initial storage conditions of a detention tank. Developed in this study is a new stochastic analysis method which can provide similar results as provided by continuous simulations and overcome some of the shortcomings of the previously developed analytical probabilistic models. This stochastic analysis method uses closed-form analytical equations to estimate the runoff capture efficiency and required storage capacity. Results from these analytical equations are validated by comparing with continuous simulation results and close agreements are observed. These analytical equations are therefore proposed as a computationally efficient alternative for analyzing the hydrologic performance of combined sewer overflow tanks.
   Plain Language Summary Storm water detention tanks are widely used for the control of combined sewer overflows. Conventional continuous simulation and recently developed analytical probabilistic models can be used for analyzing their hydrologic operations. Continuous simulations are time consuming to perform and require a large amount of input data. Analytical probabilistic models still have the shortcoming of making simplifying assumptions about the initial storage conditions of a detention tank. A new analytical stochastic model is developed in this study which eliminates the shortcomings of both the continuous simulation and analytical probabilistic approaches. The new analytical stochastic model uses closed-form equations to directly estimate the system performance statistics. It can thus be used as a convenient tool for the planning, design, and operation of combined sewer overflow tanks.

AB  - As we face today's large-scale agricultural issues, the need for robust methods of agricultural forecasting has never been clearer. Yet, the accuracy and precision of our forecasts remains limited by current tools and methods. To overcome the limitations of process-based models and observed data, we iteratively designed and tested a generalizable and robust data-assimilation system that systematically constrains state variables in the APSIM model to improve forecast accuracy and precision. Our final novel system utilizes the Ensemble Kalman Filter to constrain model states and update model parameters at observed time steps and incorporates an algorithm that improves system performance through the joint estimation of system error matrices. We tested this system at the Energy Farm, a well-monitored research site in central Illinois, where we assimilated observed in situ soil moisture at daily time steps for two years and evaluated how assimilation impacted model forecasts of soil moisture, yield, leaf area index, tile flow, and nitrate leaching by comparing estimates with in situ observations. The system improved the accuracy and precision of soil moisture estimates for the assimilation layers by an average of 42% and 48%, respectively, when compared to the free model. Such improvements led to changes in the model's soil water and nitrogen processes and, on average, increased accuracy in forecasts of annual tile flow by 43% and annual nitrate loads by 10%. Forecasts of aboveground measures did not dramatically change with assimilation, a fact which highlights the limited potential of soil moisture as a constraint for a site with no water stress. Extending the scope of previous work, our results demonstrate the power of data assimilation to constrain important model estimates beyond the assimilated state variable, such as nitrate leaching. Replication of this study is necessary to further define the limitations and opportunities of the developed system.

AB  - Hydrological processes determine the transport of nutrients and passage of diffuse pollution. Consequently, catchments are likely to exhibit individual hydrochemical responses (sensitivities) to climate change, which are expected to alter the timing and amount of runoff, and to impact in-stream water quality. In developing robust catchment management strategies and quantifying plausible future hydrochemical conditions it is therefore equally important to consider the potential for spatial variability in, and causal factors of, catchment sensitivity, as it is to explore future changes in climatic pressures. This study seeks to identify those factors which influence hydrochemical sensitivity to climate change. A perturbed physics ensemble (PPE), derived from a series of global climate model (GCM) variants with specific climate sensitivities was used to project future climate change and uncertainty. Using the INtegrated CAtchment model of Phosphorus dynamics (INCA-P), we quantified potential hydrochemical responses in four neighbouring catchments (with similar land use but varying topographic and geological characteristics) in southern Ontario, Canada. Responses were assessed by comparing a 30 year baseline (1968-1997) to two future periods: 2020-2049 and 2060-2089. Although projected climate change and uncertainties were similar across these catchments, hydrochemical responses (sensitivities) were highly varied. Sensitivity was governed by quaternary geology (influencing flow pathways) and nutrient transport mechanisms. Clay-rich catchments were most sensitive, with total phosphorus (TP) being rapidly transported to rivers via overland flow. In these catchments large annual reductions in TP loads were projected. Sensitivity in the other two catchments, dominated by sandy loams, was lower due to a larger proportion of soil matrix flow, longer soil water residence times and seasonal variability in soil-P saturation. Here smaller changes in TP loads, predominantly increases, were projected. These results suggest that the clay content of soils could be a good indicator of the sensitivity of catchments to climatic input, and reinforces calls for catchment-specific management plans.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) runoff from manure can lead to eutrophication of surface water and algae growth. This study evaluates the impacts of alternative P reduction practices on dairy farm net returns and on potential P runoff. The P control practices include dairy herd nutrient management, crop nutrient management, and runoff and erosion control. Four farms representative of dairies in the Virginia Shenandoah Valley are simulated including dairies with and without supplementary broiler enterprises and with average and below average land area. A mathematical programming model was developed to predict farm production and net returns and the GLEAMS model was used to predict potential P runoff. The farms are evaluated under four scenarios: Scenario 1, no constraint on P runoff with access to crop nutrient, runoff and erosion control strategies but no access to dairy herd nutrient control strategies; Scenario 2, no constraint on P runoff with access to all crop and dairy herd nutrient control strategies; Scenario 3, constraint on P runoff with access to crop nutrient, runoff and erosion control strategies but no access to dairy herd nutrient control strategies; and Scenario 4, constraint on P runoff with access to all crop and dairy herd nutrient control strategies. Under Scenario 2, the herd nutrient control strategies increase milk output per cow and net returns on both farms and reduce P content of manure and P runoff. Under Scenario 3, limiting P runoff reduces farm returns by 1 and 3% on the average and small farms, respectively. Under Scenario 4, the P runoff constraint is less costly, reducing returns by less than 1% on both farms. Animal nutrient control strategies should be an important part of pollution control policies and programs for livestock intensive watersheds.

AB  - Plant species have different traits for mobilizing sparingly soluble phosphorus (P) resources, which could potentially lead to overyielding in P uptake by plant species mixtures compared to monocultures due to higher P uptake as a result of resource (P) partitioning and facilitation. However, there is circumstantial evidence at best for overyielding as a result of these mechanisms. Overyielding (the outcome) is easily confused with underlying mechanisms because of unclear definitions. We aimed to define a conceptual framework to separate outcome from underlying mechanisms and test it for facilitation and complementarity with respect to P acquisition by three plant species combinations grown on four soils. Our conceptual framework describes both mechanisms of complementarity and facilitation and outcomes (overyielding of mixtures or no overyielding) depending on the competitive ability of the species to uptake the mobilized P. Millet/chickpea mixtures were grown in pots on two calcareous soils mixed with calcium-bound P (CaP) and phytate P (PhyP). Cabbage/faba bean mixtures were grown on both acid and neutral soils mixed with P-coated iron (hydr)oxide (FeP) and PhyP. Wheat/maize mixtures were grown on all four soils. Rhizosphere carboxylate concentration and acid phosphatase activity (mechanisms) as well as plant P uptake and biomass (outcome) were determined for monocultures rhizosphere and species mixtures. Facilitation of P uptake occurred in millet/chickpea mixtures on one calcareous soil. We found no indications for P acquisition from different P sources, neither in millet/chickpea, nor in cabbage/faba bean mixtures. Cabbage and faba bean on the neutral soil differed in rhizosphere acid phosphatase activity and carboxylate concentration, but showed no overyielding. Wheat and maize, with similar root exudates, showed overyielding (the observed P uptake being 22% higher than the expected P uptake) on one calcareous soil. We concluded that although differences in plant physiological traits (root exudates) provide necessary conditions for complementarity and facilitation with respect to P uptake from different P sources, they do not necessarily result in increased P uptake by species mixtures, because of the relative competitive ability of the mixed species.

AB  - Background Rice paddy wetlands may serve as a nutrient source or sink in agricultural ecosystems. However, the pattern of nutrient loss on a watershed scale is not clear. A year-round on-site observation study based on 6-h intervals was conducted. Rainfall, temperature, runoff nutrient concentrations, and adjacent stream water samples were automatically monitored to uncover the temporal changes in the runoff losses of the predominant nutrient proxies (total N and total P) from a typical rice-planting area (120 ha) in the Yangtze river delta region of China. Results A high total N concentration in the rice-planting area was observed during the rice-planting season; however, significant fluctuation in the total P was evident throughout the year. The Delta total N (drainage minus stream) parameter showed negative values with a mean of -0.25 mg L-1, while Delta total P showed positive values with a mean of 0.06 mg L-1. The annual average N and P runoff from paddy field were 11.6 kg ha(-1) and 1.5 kg ha(-1), respectively. The window phases for the total N loss were mainly concentrated in the rice-growing season. However, the window phase for the total P loss was more dispersive throughout the year. No apparent relationships were found between rainfall and N and P concentrations by self-organizing map analysis. Conclusions The high-resolution monitoring, in this study, suggested that nutrient loss loading rather than nutrient concentration was strongly related to surface runoff Therefore, fertilization before high-intensity rainfall should be avoided to mitigate the nutrient runoff losses and maintain the rice wetland eco-function.

AB  - Nutrient management on US dairy farms must balance an array of priorities, some of which conflict. To illustrate nutrient management challenges and opportunities across the US dairy industry, the USDA Agricultural Research Service Dairy Agroecosystems Working Group (DAWG) modeled 8 confinement and 2 grazing operations in the 7 largest US dairy-producing states using the Integrated Farm System Model (IFSM). Opportunities existed across all of the dairies studied to increase on-farm feed production and lower purchased feed bills, most notably on large dairies (>1,000 cows) with the highest herd densities. Purchased feed accounted for 18 to 44% of large dairies' total operating costs compared with 7 to 14% on small dairies (<300 milk cows) due to lower stocking rates. For dairies with larger land bases, in addition to a reduction in environmental impact, financial incentives exist to promote prudent nutrient management practices by substituting manure nutrients or legume nutrients for purchased fertilizers. Environmental priorities varied regionally and were principally tied to facility management for dry-lot dairies of the semi-arid western United States (ammonia-N emissions), to manure handling and application for humid midwestern and eastern US dairies (nitrate-N leaching and P runoff), and pasture management for dairies with significant grazing components (nitrous oxide emissions). Many of the nutrient management challenges identified by DAWG are beyond slight modifications in management and require coordinated solutions to ensure an environmentally and economically sustainable US dairy industry.

AB  - Agricultural intensification to meet the food needs of the rapidly growing population in developing countries affects water quality. In regions such as the Lake Tana basin, knowledge is lacking on measures to reduce non-point source pollutants in humid tropical monsoon climates. The aim of this paper was, therefore, to develop a non-point model that can predict the placement of practices to reduce the transport of sediment and phosphorus (P) in a (sub) humid watershed.
   In order to achieve the objective, hydrometeorological, sediment, and P data were collected in the watershed since 2014. The parameter efficient semi-distributed watershed model (PED-WM) was calibrated and validated in the Ethiopian highlands to simulate runoff and associated sediments generated through saturation excess. The P module added to PED-WM was used to predict dissolved (DP) and particulate P (PP) loads aside from discharge and sediment loads of the 700 ha of the Awramba watershed of Lake Tana basin. The PED-WM modules were evaluated using the statistical model performance measuring techniques. The model parameter based prediction of source areas for the non-point source sediment and P was also evaluated spatially and compared with the Topographic Wetness Index (TWI) of the watershed.
   The water balance component of the non-point source model performed well in predicting discharge, sediment, DP, and PP with NSE of 0.7, 0.65, 0.65, and 0.63, respectively. In addition, the predicted discharge followed the hydrograph with insignificant deviation from its pattern due to seasonality. The model predicted a sediment yield of 28.2 t ha(-1) year(-1) and P yield of 9.2 kg ha(-1) year(-1) from Awrmaba. Furthermore, non-point source areas contributed to 2.7 kg ha(-1) year(-1) (29%) of DP at the outlet. The main runoff and sediment source areas identified using PED-WM were the periodically saturated runoff areas. These saturated areas were also the main source for DP and PP transport in the catchment.
   Using the PED-WM with the P module enables the identification of the source areas as well as the prediction of P and sediment loading which yields valuable information for watershed management and placement of best management practices.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) production, as it stimulates root growth by improving water use efficiency and nutrient uptake. It also helps control the metabolic processes of ATP (energy), sugars, and nucleic acids. Therefore, it is imperative to effectively manage the phosphorus requirements of tomatoes to bolster their productivity. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of three different soil P testing methods that are suitable for the soils of Kano State, Nigeria, and to develop a critical P-value for fertilizer recommendations for tomatoes. Accordingly, sixty topsoil samples were collected for soil available P testing according to the Bray II, Mehlich 3, and Olsen methods. Moreover, to establish the phosphorus critical value (Pc) for tomatoes, a field experiment was conducted with seven different rates of P using triple super phosphate fertilizer (TSP), viz., 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 kg P/ha, laid out in a randomized complete block design with three replications on 15 experimental sites representing the various agroecological zones of the state. Phosphorus fertilizer was applied and incorporated into the soil 1 week before tomato transplanting. Then, soil samples from 0 to 20 cm depth were taken 3 weeks after transplanting from all the plots across the experimental sites for separate Mehlich 3, Bray II, and Olsen extractable P analysis to determine the critical soil P (Pc) test. The study revealed that available P was varied and increased in the order of Olsen (2.19 ppm)< Mehlich 3 (5.37 ppm)< Bray II (5.44 ppm), and the Mehlich 3 and Bray II extraction methods were strongly correlated, whereas Olsen underestimated the available P, showing a weak correlation with both Mehlich 3 and Bray II. Furthermore, the study showed that phosphorus critical (Pc) values were 17.00, 14.00, and 4 ppm for Mehlich 3, Bray II, and Olsen respectively. Finally, Bray II was a more reliable method for estimating the available P on moderately acid soils as it showed the highest correlation r = 0.83 with the relative yield of the tomatoes and, therefore, was the most effective method for developing the equation for the soil test-based phosphatic fertilizer recommendation for maximizing tomato production in the soils of Kano State. Hence, the equation developed for the P fertilizer recommendation (Pr) for tomatoes in Kano State was found to be "Pr (kg P2O5 ha(-1)) = (14.0 - Pi) x 9.02".

AB  - The excessive use of nitrogen (N) fertilizer for crop production can cause substantial N losses through surface runoff, generating serious nonpoint pollution. A thorough understanding of N runoff losses is necessary for optimal N management in vegetable production systems. A 3-year field experiment was conducted at a Chinese cabbage field in the Taihu Lake Basin of China to evaluate the characteristics of N runoff losses and the effect of different N fertilizer treatments on N runoff losses during the autumn and winter, 2010-2012. The results demonstrated that surface runoff was significantly and positively related to rainfall. The highest risk of N runoff loss occurred one week after fertilization, and top dressing increased this risk. NO3-- N was the main runoff component, accounting for 49.32-71.82% of the total N losses. The concentration of NO3--N was significantly and positively related to the concentration of total N in the runoff. Significant differences in N runoff losses were observed between N fertilizer treatments. N runoff losses from conventional fertilizer were 10.43-22.68 kg ha(-1), significantly higher than from other treatments, and the total N net runoff loss rates for conventional fertilizer treatment were 3.48-7.56%. The application of organic fertilizer reduced N runoff loss by 15.70-18.14% compared to conventional fertilizer application. Organic-inorganic compound fertilizer reduced N runoff loss by 27.37-36.27% compared with conventional fertilizer. Slow-release fertilizers had very significant positive effects in controlling N runoff loss, with a 58.29-61.01% reduction for sulfur-coated urea, a 49.33-56.05% reduction for biological carbon power urea, and a 59.79-63.59% reduction for bulk-blend controlled-release fertilizer relative to conventional fertilizer. This study provides vital baseline information for fertilizer choice and management practices, which can be used to reduce N runoff losses and encourage the development of new fertilizer strategies for vegetable planting.

AB  - The Cropsyst crop-soil-simulation model was used to assess the performance of conservation tillage in comparison to conventional tillage during 13 years of continuous maize cropping in highland Mexico. We tested if the calibration and validation requirements for CropSyst could be met using data sets, which were routinely collected by agronomists. Highest maize yield was observed under zero-tillage with retained residues. Simulation results indicated that this was due to more favorable moisture conditions, attenuating water stress in adverse years. Soil mineral N concentration measured in 1998 indicated the likelihood for N-stress under zero-tillage with residues retained. CropSyst additionally predicted N-stress as a yield limiting factor in other years, despite a seemingly optimal N supply by mineral fertilizer. CropSyst could predict yield under conventional tillage with residues retained and under zero-tillage with residues removed reasonably well, indicated by a modified Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (E-1) of 0.32 and 0.48. Yield predictions for conventional tillage with residues removed were poor (E-1 = -0.05) and those for zero-tillage with residues retained insufficient (E-1 = -0.20). Nonetheless, simulation results highlighted systematic differences between treatments with regard to water and N-dynamics. CropSyst lacks routines to account for soil crusting, the temporal impact of tillage on soil hydraulic conditions and the effect of surface residues physically restraining surface water runoff. These model shortcomings and the lack of detailed and continuous field measurement constrained detailed analyses and discussion of quantities produced by the model. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Improved agricultural practices are encouraged to reduce nitrate leaching and greenhouse gas emissions. However, the effects of these practices are often studied at annual or rotation scale without considering their long-term impacts. We have evaluated the effects of catch crops (CC), no-till (NT) and reduced nitrogen fertilization (N-) on nitrogen fate in soil-plant system during 13-17 years in three experiments in Northern France. CC were present in all sites whereas tillage treatment and N fertilization rate were tested separately at one site. Crop biomass, N uptake and N leaching were monitored during the whole period. The N balance, i.e. the difference between N inputs and crop exportations, was only affected by fertilization rate whereas leached N varied with all techniques. CC was the most efficient technique to decrease N leaching (from 36 to 62%) and remained efficient on the long term. NT and N-had a positive but smaller impact. N storage in soil organic matter was markedly increased by CC (by 1024 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), decreased by N- (-7.3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and not significantly affected by NT. The differences in gaseous N losses (denitrification + volatilization) between treatments were assessed by nitrogen mass balance. CC establishment had no significant effect on N gaseous emissions while NT increased them by 3.6 +/- 0.9 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1) and N-reduced them by 13.6 +/- 4.6 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1). Catch crops appear as a win/win technique with respect to nitrate leaching and C and N sequestration in soil. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The rising cost of commercial nitrogen fertilizers indicates that additional research is needed concerning agronomic practices required to integrate legumes into cereal-based cropping systems. This study examined how planting date affects the productivity of grass pea (Lathyrus sativus L.) in central Oklahoma. Experimental plots (3 by 20 m, n = 3) were disked and fertilized with 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1), and inoculum-treated (Rhizobium leguminosarum) seeds ('AC-Greenfix') were planted at 60 kg ha(-1) on 15 March, 1 April, and 15 April in 2004, 2005, and 2006. Biomass, N concentration, N accumulation per hectare, and in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDDM) of grass pea forage were determined on samples collected at 7 d of the year (DOY) after planting. Significant (P < 0.05) interactions occurred in response of biomass (DOY x year), N concentration, and IVDDM (DOY x year x planting date), and accumulated N (DOY x year; DOY x planting date). Peak biomass in 2004, 2005, and 2006 was 3900, 5800, and 3500 kg ha-1, respectively. Maximum accumulated N related to years was 115 to 157 kg ha(-1) between DOY 165 and DOY 195. Peak N accumulation of 125 to 153 kg ha(-1) occurred between DOY 180 and DOY 210. Grass pea is flexible in response to spring planting dates, indicating that it can be sown as a green manure or forage crop during a 30-d period in the southern Great Plains and still maximize biomass and N accumulation.

AB  - Nutrient supplies from indigenous sources (IS) can be estimated by measuring plant nutrient uptake in nutrient omission plots. On-farm experiments were conducted in irrigated rice (Oryza sativa L.) domains of Asia to evaluate relationships of plant N, P, and K uptake with soil tests or grain yield measured in N, P, and K omission (0-N, 0-P, and 0-K, respectively) plots and to develop guidelines for the use of omission plots in site-specific management. Relationships between grain yield or nutrient accumulation and soil tests were scattered. Only 17% of the variation in plant N uptake in 0-N plots was explained by total soil organic C. Extractable Olsen P explained 34% of plant P uptake in 0-P plots, whereas I M ammonium acetate K showed no common relationship with plant K uptake in 0-K plots. With good calibration, indigenous supply of N (INS), P (IPS), and K (IKS) can be estimated from grain yields in omission plots with a precision of about +/-5 to 10 kg N ha(-1), +/-2 to 3 kg P ha(-1), and +/-10 to 20 kg K ha(-1), respectively. Sampling requirements for estimating domain-specific IS values depend on the homogeneity of the domain of interest. For irrigated rice domains of about 100 to 200 km(2), grain yield in omission plots should be measured in at least one high-yielding season in about 10 farms to estimate the domain mean INS, IPS, and IKS. Future research should focus on developing geospatial techniques for delineating fertilizer recommendation domains based on biophysical and socioeconomic characteristics that determine yield potential, IS, and response to fertilizer.

AB  - The transition away from forage-based cropping systems in Iowa to corn and soybean rotations since World War 11 has corresponded with degraded economic and environmental conditions in the state. Falling net incomes for farmers and concern over global warming and the effects of agriculture-related pollution on water, wildlife and human health have increased interest in diversified cropping systems. This paper reviews the benefits of diversifying Iowa corn and soybean rotations with perennial forage species such as alfalfa and red clover. Perennial forage crops improve soil quality, decrease NO3-N leaching and soil erosion, increase carbon sequestration and decrease pesticide and herbicide needs by controlling weed and insect pests. Forage legumes reduce N fertilizer needs for succeeding corn crops at a higher rate than soybeans, and corn crops following forages have higher yields than after corn or soybeans. Farmers who add alfalfa to corn and soybean rotations could realize significant economic gains. A simulated 5-year rotation in Iowa including corn-soybeans-oats/alfalfa-alfalfa-alfalfa would result in a 24% net income increase over 5 years of corn-soybean-corn-soybean-corn, even with government farm support payments for the row crops. Farm policies that encourage commodity production create little incentive for Iowa farmers to diversify their cropping systems beyond corn and soybeans, despite the clear economic and ecological benefits. We recommend increasing federal support for conservation programs that reward environmentally beneficial farm practices such as the Conservation Securities Program and we encourage land grant universities to hire researchers interested in alternative agricultural systems.

AB  - A series of experiments were conducted at Sindh Agriculture University, Tandojam. The experiment was laid out in Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with factorial arrangement consisting four replications and repeated in the 2(nd) year. The treatments consisted crop two sequences [C-1= Cotton (before legume) and C-2= Cotton (after legume)] and varying fertility levels (F-1=150-50, F-2=100-50 and F-3=150-50 NP Kg ha(-1)). The berseem was cultivated as leguminous crop in the sequence. The crop sequences revealed that the cotton crop sown after legume produced tall plants (99.41 cm), higher production of monopodia plant(-1) (2.68), sympodia plant(-1) (14.10), more bolls plant(-1) (24.83), heavier seed index (6.83 g), maximum GOT (34.47%), better staple length (28.83mm), higher oil content (22.87%), superior seed cotton yield (2428 kg ha(-1)) and N-uptake increased upto 91.17 ka ha(-1). The incorporation of NP fertilizer significantly affected crop parameters. Among the tested fertilizers, 150-50 NP kg ha-1 recorded maximum plant height (102.63 cm), monopodia plant(-1) (2.61), sympodia plant(-1) (13.70), bolls plant(-1) (26.40), seed index (6.83g), GOT (34.57%), staple length (28.65mm), oil content (23.10%), seed cotton yield (2538.25 kg ha(-1)) and N-uptake (113.43 kg ha(-1)). It is concluded that nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers are essential nutrients, but for maintenance of soil fertility and enhancement of crop productivity the inclusion of leguminous crop at least once in a two year cropping sequence is necessary, because leguminous crops enrich soil fertility by fixing environmental nitrogen in their root nodules, which in turn supply residual food nutrients to the succeeding crop. Thus, (i) continuous cropping in the sequence of wheat-cotton be avoided, (ii) the higher yields of cotton and wheat could be achieved in the farming system which includes legumes in crop rotation, (iii) the application of 150-50 NP kg ha(-1) is sufficient for.. satisfactory yield and qualitative characters of cotton and (iv) the use of in-organic nitrogenous fertilizers could be minimized by succession of legume crop in the crop sequence.

AB  - In the long term, changes of N input (e.g. amount of N fertilization) or N output (e.g. N offtake in the grain) can affect soil N content and, in consequence, potential soil N mineralization, which may promote crop growth and support yield formation. The aim of this study was to quantify the residual effects of a former N fertilization on N mineralization, crop growth, N uptake and grain yield. From 1990/1991 to 1998/1999, different N treatments including slurry (none, 80 k N ha(-1) as pig slurry in autumn, in spring, in autumn + spring) and mineral N fertilization (0-240 kg N ha(-1)) were tested in a winter oilseed rape (OSR) - winter wheat - winter barley rotation on a pseudogleyic sandy loam (Luvisol) at Hohenschulen Experimental Station near Kiel in NW Germany. Each year, treatments occurred in all three crops of the rotation and were located on the same plots. Accumulated over the experimental period, the N balance (N supply - N offtake - N leaching) of the different N treatments varied between -740 and +1300 kg N ha(-1). In 1999/2000-2001/2002, all plots remained unfertilized in order to avoid interactions with the actual N fertilization.
   The former N treatments enhanced dry matter and total N uptake of wheat in 2000-2002 compared with the former unfertilized control, however, differences were not significant (P > 0.05) at most sampling dates. Also soil mineral N (SMN) in 0-30 cm remained unaffected during spring 2001 and 357 in 2002. growth. Lately, on average of all treatments, grain yield of wheat decreased from 692 g m(-2) in 2000 to 687 g m(-2) in 2001 and 357 g m(-2) in 2002. Barley yielded 481, 462 and 207 g m(-2), and OSR 375, 350 and 176 m(-2), respectively. Total N uptake in the above-ground biomass of wheat at harvest was reduced from 109 kg N ha(-1) in 2000 to 76 kg N ha(-1) in 2001 and 59 kg N ha(-1) in 2002, respectively. Barley accumulated 69, 57 and 33 kg N ha(-1) in the above-ground biomass, and OSR 120, 111 and 59 ka N ha(-1), respectively. In all crops, residual N effects were largest in the first year (2000) and decreased with the years. The residual effects of slurry and mineral N fertilizer were similar.
   Considering the differences of 2000 kg N ha(-1) in the N balance, the residual effect on N uptake remained at a very low level. The crops used on average 3% of the N surplus within the first three years without N fertilization, i.e. about 1% per year. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Rhizoctonia solani can have a substantial impact on seedling establishment and productivity of canola (Brassica napus). The effects of seeding date, seeding depth, seed size, and seed treatment on seedling blight of canola were evaluated under greenhouse and field conditions. Early seeding resulted in higher seedling emergence in one trial year and higher seed yield in all trial years relative to a late-seeded treatment. Mid-sized seed (range 0.7-2.0 mm diam.) had greater seedling emergence in R. solani-inoculated growth medium in a greenhouse trial and higher seed yield in one of two field trials compared with smaller seed (<0.7 mm). In the greenhouse study, sowing of large seed resulted in greater plant height and shoot weight compared with sowing of smaller seed. The effect of seeding depth was significant only on shoot dry weight, which increased at a seeding depth of 2.6 cm. Seed treatment with Helix Xtra (thiamethoxam + difenconazole + metalaxyl + fludioxonil), and Prosper FX (clothianidin + carboxin + trifloxystrobin + metalaxyl) resulted in a significant increase in seedling emergence and yield compared with the inoculated control. These results indicate that fungicidal seed treatment can minimize the impact of R. solani on canola.

AB  - The sparse natural vegetation develops special water use characteristics to adapt to inhospitable desert areas. The water use characteristics of such plants in desert areas are not yet completely understood. In this study, we compare the differences in water use characteristics between two dominant species of the Badain Jaran Desert mega-dunes-Zygophyllum xanthoxylum and Artemisia ordosica-by investigating delta H-2 and delta O-18 in plant xylem (the organization that transports water and inorganic salts in plant stems) and soil water, and delta C-13 in plant leaves. The results indicate that Z. xanthoxylum absorbed 86.5% of its water from soil layers below 90 cm during growing seasons, while A. ordosica derived 79.90% of its water from the 0-120 cm soil layers during growing seasons. Furthermore, the long-term leaf-level water use efficiency of A. ordosica (123.17 +/- 2.13 mu mol/mol) was higher than that of Z. xanthoxylum (97.36 +/- 1.16 mu mol/mol). The differences in water use between the two studied species were mainly found to relate to their root distribution characteristics. A better understanding of the water use characteristics of plants in desert habitats can provide a theoretical basis to assist in the selection of species for artificial vegetation restoration in arid areas.

AB  - Denitrification is a key process in soil available nitrogen (N) loss. However, the effects of different water-saving irrigation systems on soil N components and denitrifying bacterial communities are still unclear. In this study, quantitative fluorescence PCR and Illumina MiSeq sequencing were used to investigate the effects of three main irrigation systems, conventional flooding irrigation (FP), shallow buried drip irrigation (DI), and mulched drip irrigation (MF), on the abundance, community composition, and diversity of soil nirK- and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria in the semi-arid area of Northeast China, and to clarify the driving factors of nirK- and nirS-type denitrifying bacterial community variations. The results showed that, compared with FP, MF significantly increased soil moisture, alkaline hydrolyzed nitrogen (AHN), nitrate nitrogen (NO3--N), non-acid hydrolyzed nitrogen (AIN), and amino sugar nitrogen (ASN), but significantly decreased the contents of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) and acid hydrolyzed ammonium nitrogen (AN). The irrigation system changed the relative abundance of the dominant genera of denitrifying bacteria, DI and MF significantly increased nitrate reductase (NR) and nitrite reductase (NiR) activities, and MF significantly increased the diversity of nirK- and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria but significantly decreased the richness. The community structure of nirK- and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria was significantly different among the three irrigation systems. NO3--N was the main driving factor affecting the community structure of nirS-type denitrifying bacteria, and moisture significantly affected the community structure of nirK-type denitrifying bacteria. DI and MF significantly increased the abundance of nirK- and nirS-type denitrifying bacteria and also increased the abundance ratio of nirS/nirK genes. Therefore, although DI and MF significantly increased the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms, they did not lead to an increase in the N2O emission potential.

AB  - One of the most important functions of catchments is the storage of water. Catchment storage buffers meteorological extremes and interannual streamflow variability, controls the partitioning between evaporation and runoff, and influences transit times of water. Hydrogeological data to estimate storage are usually scarce and seldom available for a larger set of catchments. This study focused on storage in prealpine and alpine catchments, using a set of 21 Swiss catchments comprising different elevation ranges. Catchment storage comparisons depend on storage definitions. This study defines different types of storage including definitions of dynamic and mobile catchment storage. We then estimated dynamic storage using four methods, water balance analysis, streamflow recession analysis, calibration of a bucket-type hydrological model Hydrologiska Byrans Vattenbalansavdelning model (HBV), and calibration of a transfer function hydrograph separation model using stable isotope observations. The HBV model allowed quantifying the contributions of snow, soil and groundwater storages compared to the dynamic catchment storage. With the transfer function hydrograph separation model both dynamic and mobile storage was estimated. Dynamic storage of one catchment estimated by the four methods differed up to one order of magnitude. Nevertheless, the storage estimates ranked similarly among the 21 catchments. The largest dynamic and mobile storage estimates were found in high-elevation catchments. Besides snow, groundwater contributed considerably to this larger storage. Generally, we found that with increasing elevation the relative contribution to the dynamic catchment storage increased for snow, decreased for soil, but remained similar for groundwater storage.

AB  - Aims: Plant water status monitoring during the vineyard growth cycle constitutes a basic parameter for both harvest quality and vineyard management. Unfortunately, the plant water status measurement requires skills and heavy devices which drastically limit the number of repetitions either in space or in time. Moreover, due to the significant spatial variability in viticulture, extrapolation of one local measurement to a larger scale, vine field or vineyard, is difficult. Therefore, the design of tools and methods to characterize and to assess the spatial variability of plant water status constitutes a big challenge. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach allowing the spatial variability of the plant water status to be assessed.
   Methods and results: This work proposes a complete literature review of previous works using different approaches to assess the vine water status. Based on this review, it leads to a conceptual approach considering the Spatial (S) and Temporal (T) variability of the plant water status assessment at a whole vineyard scale. This paper is divided into three sections: (i) description of plant water status reference methods based oil direct measurements oil the plant, (ii) plant water status assessment methods based oil auxiliary information (i.e. weather, soil and plant vegetative expression), and finally (iii) a proposal for combining local reference measurement and auxiliary information to characterize the spatial variability of the vine water status at the vineyard scale.
   Conclusion:Taking into account restrictive assumptions, this paper points out the possibility to provide relevant spatial assessment of the vine water status. This possibility is illustrated with a simple example.
   Significance and impact of the results: This work gives all answer to the significant problem of vine water status assessment over space. It proposes all approach based oil high spatial resolution auxiliary information to extrapolate a measurement (PLWP or SWP) made at a given time oil a reference site. This proposal determines the different steps for further investigations aiming at proposing a spatial model of vine water status.

AB  - Plantation cultivation plays an important role in improving terrestrial ecosystem functions and services. Understanding the water-use patterns of major afforestation species is vital for formulating ecological restoration strategies and predicting the response of plantation to climate change. However, the impacts and drivers of forest types on water-use patterns of key tree species are poorly understood. Here, the combined methods of dual stable isotope of delta D and delta O-18 and Bayesian mixed framework (MixSIAR) were employed to investigate the water-use patterns of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Chinese fir) in a monoculture, mixed forest with Cinnamomum camphora, and mixed forest with Alnus cremastogyne under different rainfall events in subtropical China. Furthermore, the relative contribution of different soil and plant factors to the water-use patterns of Chinese fir was quantified using a random forest model. Our results showed that Chinese fir in the mixed forests (with C. camphora or with A. cremastogyne) utilized less water from shallow soil compared to that in a monoculture but significantly improved the proportion of water absorbed from deep soil with the increase of 55.57%-64.90% and 68.99%-108.83% following moderate and heavy rainfall events, respectively. The most important factors contributing to the differences in water-use patterns of Chinese fir among monoculture and mixed forests were tree attributes (i.e., leaf biomass, eco-physiological regulation, and fine root biomass). These findings reveal that Chinese fir in mixed forests could optimize water-use patterns by adjusting plant properties for interspecific niche complementarity, improving the utilization of deep soil water. Overall, this study suggests that mixed-species plantations could improve water-use efficiency and reduce the sensitivity of tree species to precipitation change, indicating they are better able to cope with expected climate variability.

AB  - High-low seedbed cultivation (HLSC) is a key technique now used by smallholder and large farmers to increase the land utilization rate of wheat production in the North China Plain (NCP). However, little information is available on its superiority in crop productivity, resource utilization efficiency, and net return in comparison with flat cultivation (FC). A field experiment was conducted in the NCP in the 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 wheat seasons to determine whether HLSC would increase crop productivity, evapotranspiration (ET), intercepted photosynthetically active radiation (IPAR), crop nitrogen uptake and resource use efficiency. Two treatments were established, i.e., FC and HLSC, respectively. The results showed that HLSC significantly increased tiller development, leaf area index (LAI), and aboveground biomass compared with FC. Although HLSC did not in-crease ET relative to FC (P > 0.05), it increased IPAR by 5.5-6.6 % and grain nitrogen uptake by 12.1-12.6 % (P < 0.05). Pearson correlation analysis indicated that grain yield and biomass yield were regulated by the resource capture of wheat. Therefore, HLSC significantly increased grain yield by 14.5-18.3 % and net return by 45.4-59.3 % and enhanced the efficient use of resources by 13.2-15.6 % in water, 8.5-11.1 % in radiation, and 14.5-18.3 % in nitrogen compared with FC. HLSC is a promising planting system for improving crop productivity and resource use efficiency.

AB  - Irrigation efficiency plays an important role in agricultural productivity; it affects farm-scale water demand, and the partitioning of irrigation losses into evaporative and non-evaporative components. This partitioning determines return flow generation and thus affects water availability. Over the last two decades, hydrologic and agricultural research communities have significantly improved our understanding of the impacts of climate change on water availability and food productivity. However, the impacts of climate change on the efficiency of irrigation systems, particularly on the partitioning between evaporative and non-evaporative losses, have received little attention. In this study, we incorporated a process-based irrigation module into a coupled hydrologic/agricultural modeling framework (VIC-CropSyst). To understand how climate change may impact irrigation losses, we applied VIC-CropSyst over the Yakima River basin, an important agricultural region in Washington State, U.S. We compared the historical period of 1980-2010 to an ensemble of ten projections of climate for two future periods: 2030-2060 and 2060-2090. Results averaged over the watershed showed that a 9% increase in evaporative losses will be compensated by a reduction of non-evaporative losses. Therefore, overall changes in future efficiency are negligible (-0.4%) while the Evaporative Loss Ratio (ELR) (defined as the ratio of evaporative to non-evaporative irrigation losses) is enhanced by 10%. This higher ELR is associated with a reduction in return flows, thus negatively impacting downstream water availability. Results also indicate that the impact of climate change on irrigation losses depend on irrigation type and climate scenarios. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Summer rainfall in the southeast Prairie Pothole Region (SEPPR) is an important part of a vital wetland ecosystem that various species use as their habitat. We examine sources and pathways for summer rainfall moisture, large-scale features influencing moisture delivery, and large-scale connections related to summer moisture using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model. Analysis of HYSPLIT back trajectories shows that land is the primary moisture source for summer rainfall events indicating moisture recycling plays an important role in precipitation generation. The Great Plains Low-Level Jet/Maya Express is the most prominent moisture pathway. It impacts events sourced by land and the Gulf of Mexico (GoM), the secondary moisture source. There is a coupling between land, atmosphere, and ocean conveyed by large-scale climate connections between rainfall events and sea surface temperature (SST), Palmer Drought Severity Index, and 850-mb heights. Land-sourced events have a connection to the northern Pacific and northwest Atlantic Oceans, soil moisture over the central U.S., and low-pressure systems over the SEPPR. GoM-sourced events share the connection to soil moisture over the central U.S. but also show connections to SSTs in the North Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and the GoM, soil moisture in northern Mexico, and 850-mb heights in the eastern Pacific Ocean. Both types of events show connections to high 850-mb heights in the Caribbean which may reflect a connection to Bermuda High. These insights into moisture sources and pathways can improve skill in SEPPR summer rainfall predictions and benefit natural resource managers in the region.

AB  - The global prevalence of rapid and extensive land use change necessitates hydrologic modelling methodologies capable of handling non-stationarity. This is particularly true in the context of Hydrologic Forecasting using Data Assimilation. Data Assimilation has been shown to dramatically improve forecast skill in hydrologic and meteorological applications, although such improvements are conditional on using bias-free observations and model simulations. A hydrologic model calibrated to a particular set of land cover conditions has the potential to produce biased simulations when the catchment is disturbed. This paper sheds new light on the impacts of bias or systematic errors in hydrologic data assimilation, in the context of forecasting in catchments with changing land surface conditions and a model calibrated to pre-change conditions. We posit that in such cases, the impact of systematic model errors on assimilation or forecast quality is dependent on the inherent prediction uncertainty that persists even in pre-change conditions. Through experiments on a range of catchments, we develop a conceptual relationship between total prediction uncertainty and the impacts of land cover changes on the hydrologic regime to demonstrate how forecast quality is affected when using state estimation Data Assimilation with no modifications to account for land cover changes. This work shows that systematic model errors as a result of changing or changed catchment conditions do not always necessitate adjustments to the modelling or assimilation methodology, for instance through re-calibration of the hydrologic model, time varying model parameters or revised offline/online bias estimation.

AB  - Livestock is poorly represented in N budgets for the African continent although some studies have examined livestock-related N flows at different levels. Livestock plays an important role in N cycling and therefore on N budgets including livestock-related flows. This study reviews the literature on N budgets for Africa to identify factors contributing to uncertainties. Livestock densities are usually modelled because of the lack of observational spatial data. Even though feed availability and quality varies across seasons, most studies use constant livestock excretion rates, and excreta are usually assumed to be uniformly distributed onto the land. Major uncertainties originate in the fraction of manure managed, and emission factors which may not reflect the situation of Africa. N budgets use coarse assumptions on production, availability, and use of crop residues as livestock feed. No flows between croplands-livestock and rangelands reflect the lack of data. Joint efforts are needed for spatial data collection of livestock data, crowdsourcing appears to be a promising option. The focus of the assessment of N budgets must go beyond croplands to include livestock and crop-livestock flows. We propose a nested systems definition of livestock systems to link local, regional level, and continental level and to increase the usefulness of point measurements of N losses. Scientists working at all levels should generate data to calibrate process-based models. Measurements in the field should not only concentrate on greenhouse gas emissions, but need to include crop and livestock production measurements, soil stock changes and other N loss pathways such as leaching, run-off and volatilization to assess management practices and trade-offs. Compared to the research done in other continents on N flows in livestock systems, there are few data for Africa, and therefore concerted effort will be needed to generate sufficient data for modelling.

AB  - We developed a parsimonious topography-based hydrologic model coupled with a soil biogeochemistry sub-model in order to improve understanding and prediction of soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) transfer in agricultural headwater catchments. The model structure aims to capture the dominant hydrological and biogeochemical processes identified from multiscale observations in a research catchment (Kervidy-Naizin, 5 km(2)). Groundwater fluctuations, responsible for the connection of soil SRP production zones to the stream, were simulated with a fully distributed hydrologic model at 20m resolution. The spatial variability of the soil phosphorus content and the temporal variability of soil moisture and temperature, which had previously been identified as key controlling factors of SRP solubilization in soils, were included as part of an empirical soil biogeochemistry sub-model. The modelling approach included an analysis of the information contained in the calibration data and propagation of uncertainty in model predictions using a generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) "limits of acceptability" framework. Overall, the model appeared to perform well given the uncertainty in the observational data, with a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency on daily SRP loads between 0.1 and 0.8 for acceptable models. The role of hydrological connectivity via groundwater fluctuation and the role of increased SRP solubilization following dry/hot periods were captured well. We conclude that in the absence of near-continuous monitoring, the amount of information contained in the data is limited; hence, parsimonious models are more relevant than highly parameterized models. An analysis of uncertainty in the data is recommended for model calibration in order to provide reliable predictions.

AB  - Phosphorus (P) deficiency is one of the major yield-limiting factors for lowland rice production in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Therefore, improved P management could be an effective strategy to increase lowland rice yields in SSA. The study reviews on historical and recent efforts for improving P management for lowland rice production in SSA together with their limitations and prospects for future research. Special focuses are on following three aspects: (1) suitable soil tests to assess the indigenous soil P supply and the yield response to P application in lowlands; (2) organic inputs and localized P application to the nursery bed (nursery P) and to the seedling roots at transplanting (P-dipping); (3) the interaction between P application and climate-induced stresses via its impact on phenological development. For the first aspect, we demonstrate the importance of considering the P adsorption and desorption kinetics in SSA soils, where large amounts of insoluble P complexes are bound to iron and aluminum oxides while these insoluble P pools are solubilized under submerged soil culture. We propose using the oxalate-extractable P, which extracts insoluble P pools bound to amorphous iron-oxide minerals, as a reliable test for measuring the indigenous soil P supply for lowland rice production. With respect to the second aspect, the efficient use of organic inputs-an important nutrient resource for smallholder farmers in SSA-can be reconsidered not only as a source of P but also as a substance to accelerate the chemical reaction and P solubilization in soils for lowland rice production. Several studies have demonstrated significant effects of nursery P and P-dipping to increase rice yields and agronomic P use efficiency (AEP) as the yield gain per unit of P applied. Excess yield gains with a micro-dosing nursery P may have a risk of P mining from soils. The P-dipping retains the P input-output balance and achieves a consistently high AEP at 74-152 kg kg-1. The third aspect has received little attention in the previous studies, although recent observations indicate that P management affects rice yields via its impact on phenological development. The time to heading under P deficiency can extend beyond three weeks, which allows plants to accumulate more biomass production while increasing the risk of biotic and abiotic stresses at the reproductive and ripening stages. Further attention should be paid to changes in phenological development and their interactions with climate-induced stress to develop improved P management practices in SSA.

AB  - The impact of various production systems on leaf nutrient concentration and soil organic matter, pH, and nutrient status was evaluated from the first growing season (2007) through maturity (2016) in a certified organic planting of northern highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum L.). Treatments included planting method (on raised beds or flat ground), fertilizer source (granular feather meal or fish solubles) and rate ("low'' and "high'' rates of 29 and 57 kg.ha(-1) N, respectively, during establishment, increased incrementally as the planting matured to 73 and 140 kg.ha(-1) N, respectively), mulch [sawdust, yard-debris compost topped with sawdust (compost + sawdust), or black, woven polyethylene groundcover (weed mat)], and cultivar (Duke or Liberty). Mulches were replenished, as needed, and weeds were controlled throughout the study. The impacts of year, planting method, fertilizer, mulch, and cultivar on leaf and soil nutrient levels over this 10-year study were complex with many interactions among treatments. Soil pH remained within the recommended range for all treatments. Plants fertilized with fish solubles had higher leaf N, P, and K concentrations than those fertilized with feather meal, particularly at the high N rate in both cultivars. By contrast, fertilization with feather meal increased leaf Ca. Compost + sawdust added a cumulative (2007-16) total of 2274, 400, 961, and 2744 kg.ha(-1) of N, P, K, and Ca, respectively, over the use of sawdust alone, and increased the concentration of P, K (as much as 90%), Ca, and Mg in the soil relative to other mulches. Soil organic matter content averaged 4.1% under compost + sawdust, 3.3% under sawdust, and 2.9% under weed mat, averaged over the last 5 years. Mulching with weed mat or compost + sawdust increased leaf K compared with sawdust in both cultivars, regardless of fertilizer treatment. Leaf Ca, on the other hand, was highest with sawdust and tended to be lowest with weed mat in both cultivars. Soil nutrient levels were not consistently correlated with leaf nutrient concentrations, other than between soil NO3-N and leaf N (5 years) and between soil and leaf K (4 years). On average, raised beds resulted in higher concentrations of N, P, K, Fe, and Al and lower concentrations of Ca, Mg, and B in the leaves than planting on flat ground. Furthermore, concentrations of N and Ca in recent fully-expanded leaves at standard sampling time was higher in young plants than in mature plants in both cultivars, whereas the opposite was found for leaf P. In 'Duke', yield was positively correlated with leaf Ca in 8 out of 9 years and negatively correlated with leaf K and P in 5 and 6 years, respectively. Leaf Ca and Mg were also negatively correlated with leaf K in most years for both cultivars, as was leaf N. Although leaf N concentration was higher with added compost, regardless of fertilizer source in 'Duke', and when fertilized with feather meal in 'Liberty', this was not correlated with yield. High N rates increased leaf N concentration, but did not result in greater yield. While soil and leaf tissue testing are important to help manage fertilizer programs, the lack of a consistent relationship between soil and plant nutrient status and yield was a reflection of the complicated interactions that occurred among nutrients in these organic production systems.
   Soil nutrient imbalances and changes in leaf nutrient concentrations associated with extended use of compost + sawdust mulch and fish solubles may lead to growth and yield problems in longer-lived plantings. In addition, the loss of organic matter under weed mat would need to be addressed in long-term plantings for sustainable production.

AB  - The integration of cover crops into cropping systems brings costs and benefits, both internal and external to the farm. Benefits include promoting pest-suppression, soil and water quality, nutrient cycling efficiency, and cash crop productivity. Costs of adopting cover crops include increased direct costs, potentially reduced income if cover crops interfere with other attractive crops, slow soil warming, difficulties in predicting N mineralization, and production expenses. Cover crop benefits tend to be higher in irrigated systems. The literature is reviewed here along with Michigan farmer experience to evaluate promising cover crop species for four niches: Northern winter (USDA Hardiness Zones 5-6), Northern summer (Zones 5-6), Southern winter (Zones 7-8), and Southern summer (Zones 7-8). Warm season C-4 grasses are outstanding performers for summer niches (6-9 Mg ha(-1)), and rye (Secale cereale L.) is the most promising for winter niches (0.8-6 Mg ha(-1)) across all hardiness zones reviewed. Legume-cereal mixtures such as sudangrass (Sorghum sudanese L.)-cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-red clover (Trifolium pretense L.) are the most effective means to produce substantial amounts (28 Mg ha(-1)) of mixed quality residues. Legume covers are slow growers and expensive to establish. At the same time, legumes fix N, produce high quality but limited amounts (0.5-4 Mg ha(-1)) of residues, and enhance beneficial insect habitat. Brassica species produce glucosinolate-containing residues (2-6 Mg ha(-1)) and suppress plant-parasitic nematodes and soil-borne disease. Legume cover crops are the most reliable means to enhance cash crop yields compared with fallows or other cover crop species. However, farmer goals and circumstances must be considered. If soil pests are a major yield limiting factor in cash crop production, then use of brassica cover crops should be considered. Cereal cover crops produce the largest amount of biomass and should be considered when the goal is to rapidly build soil organic matter. Legume-cereal or brassica-cereal mixtures show promise over a wide range of niches.

AB  - Soluble organic N (SON) is recognized to be a source of N for plants, but the few studies of the effects of clear-cut harvesting on SON levels have reported inconsistent results. SON and soluble inorganic N (SIN) contents were measured in 1 mol/L KCl extracts of soil from forests and clearcuts in coastal cedar-hemlock forests near Port McNeill, B.C., and in high-elevation spruce-fir forests near Sicamous, B.C. To characterize the seedling root environment, sampling was confined to the top 20 cm of soil (consisting of forest floor at Port McNeill and forest floor plus mineral soil at Sicamous). Amino acid N and microbial N were determined on subsets of the samples. At both sites, SON content tended to be lower in clearcuts than in forests. Lower SON contents in clearcuts were caused by the removal of F-layer forest floor at Port McNeill and by reduced SON concentrations in the forest floor at Sicamous. Correlation analyses indicated close relationships between moisture content, SIN, SON, and microbial N. Changes in SON, SIN, and microbial N concentrations during buried bag incubations could not be explained simply by exchange among these three N pools. Free amino acid N accounted for 1-1.5% of the total SON content.

AB  - Inclusion of a winter legume cover crop into a crop rotation has been suggested as a method to provide a substantial portion of the N requirement of the following crop. While the benefits of winter cover crops such as reduced soil erosion, increased soil organic matter, and increased mulch cover have been well documented, the N contribution to the subsequent crop has shown to be variable. The objective of this study was to determine the N contribution from a red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) cover crop following wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to a subsequent corn (Zea mays L.) crop. The experiment was conducted at two western Ohio locations over 3 yr. At both locations, red clover was either interseeded into wheat or seeded after harvest, the red clover cover crop was eliminated with tillage or herbicide application, and corn was planted with three N rates (0, 90, and 180 kg N ha(-1)). The data revealed that for three of the four site years (when the cover crop was successfully established) there was no N contribution attributable to the presence of red clover. The one site that did show a N contribution revealed that the amount of N contributed was less than 90 kg N ha(-1). However, even when no N benefit was found, yields were improved by non-N-related rotational effects. Significant reductions in N fertilization rates following a red clover cover crop are likely to result in lost corn yield opportunities in western Ohio.

AB  - Fall manure applications can lead to nutrient losses prior to spring planting. This 2-yr study evaluated effects of winter cereal rye (Secale cereal L.) crop management (cover crop versus ryelage), and fall, dairy slurry manure application method (broadcasted versus injected) and timing (September vs. November) on manure-N conservation. Nitrogen conservation was calculated from NH3 volatilization, percentage of manure-N in above-ground rye (%ManureN-R) and soil (%ManureN-S) in spring prior to corn (Zea mays L.) planting, and subsequent corn yield. Ryelage compared to cover crop conserved more %ManureN-R (2.6-fold) and despite reduced corn yield, ryelage-corn treatments with 3.6-fold greater rye biomass produced 20% greater total harvested forage than cover crops. Compared to broadcasted manure (BM), injected manure (IM) reduced NH3 losses and increased ryelage biomass (42%) after September (EARLY) applications, %ManureN-R (50%), %ManureN-S at multiple depths, and total harvested forage (20%). Corn silage yield with IM compared to BM was also greater after all cover crop treatments (23%), all ryelage treatments in 2015 (35%), and ryelage with a November application (LATE) in 2014 (30%). Compared to EARLY, LATE applications increased %ManureN-R in ryelage after BM (44%) and IM (50%), %ManureN-S at multiple depths in both rye treatments, and corn silage yields with IM following cover crops (21%). Following ryelage, corn yields were not larger following greater %ManureN-S in LATE IM versus BM, suggesting potential for more soil NO3 leaching loss with LATE IM. However, multiple management options reduced fall manure-N losses and conserved manure-N for crop utilization, allowing for farm management flexibility.

AB  - In recent years, many peatlands in Europe have been rewetted for nature conservation and global warming mitigation. However, the effects on emissions of the greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O) have been found to be highly variable and driving factors are poorly understood. Therefore, we measured N2O fluxes every two weeks over three years on pairs of sites (one drained, one rewetted) of three important peatland types in North-Eastern Germany, namely, percolation fen, alder forest and coastal fen. Additionally, every three months, sources of N2O were determined using a stable isotope mapping approach. Overall, fluxes were under the very dry conditions of the study years usually small with large temporal and spatial variations. Ammonium concentrations consistently and significantly correlated positively with N2O fluxes for all sites. Cumulative fluxes were often not significantly different from zero and apart from the rewetted alder forest, which was always a source of N2O, sites showed varying cumulative emission behavior (insignificant, source, potentially sink in one case) among years. Precipitation was positively correlated with cumulative fluxes on all drained sites and the rewetted alder forest. Isotope mapping indicated that N2O was always produced by more than one process simultaneously, with the estimated contribution of denitrification varying between 20 and 80%. N2O reduction played a potentially large role, with 5 to 50% of total emissions, showing large variations among sites and over time. Overall, neither the effect of rewetting, water level nor seasonality was clearly reflected in the fluxes or sources. Emissions were concentrated in hotspots and hot moments. A better understanding of the driving factors of N2O production and reduction in (rewetted) fens is essential and stable isotope methods including measurements of N-15 and O-18 as well as site preferences can help foster the necessary comprehension of the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - Ground-penetrating radar (GPR, also referred to as ground-probing radar, surface-penetrating radar, subsurface radar, georadar or impulse radar) is a noninvasive geophysical technique that detects electrical discontinuities in the shallow subsurface (< 50 in). It does this by generation, transmission, propagation, reflection and reception of discrete pulses of high-frequency (MHz) electromagnetic energy. During the 1980s radar systems became commercially available, but it was not until the mid-1990s that sedimentary geologists and others began to widely exploit the technique. During the last decade numerous sedimentological studies have used GPR to reconstruct past depositional environments and the nature of sedimentary processes in a variety of environmental settings; to aid hydrogeological investigations, including groundwater reservoir characterisation, and to assist in hydrocarbon reservoir analogue studies. This is because in correctly processed radar profiles, and at the resolution of a survey, primary reflections usually parallel primary depositional structure. Despite the wide use of GPR, a number of fundamental problems remain in its application to sedimentary research. In particular, there are a wide range of approaches to the processing of radar data and interpretation techniques used on the final subsurface images vary widely, with little consensus over a common methodology. This review attempts to illustrate that methods for the collection, processing and interpretation of radar data are intimately linked and that thorough understanding of the nature, limitations and implications of each step is required if realistic sedimentological data are to be generated. In order to extract the maximum amount of meaningful information, the user must understand the scientific principles that underlie the technique, the effects of the data collection regime employed, the implications of the technique's finite resolution and depth of penetration, the nature and causes of reflections unrelated to primary sedimentary structure, and the appropriateness of each processing step with respect to the overall aim of the study. Following suitable processing, a radar stratigraphy approach to reflection profile interpretation should be adopted. New or modified terminologies and techniques to define a radar stratigraphy are also recommended, in order to make the interpretation process more transparent and to avoid confusion with related methodologies such as seismic stratigraphy and sequence stratigraphy. The full potential of GPR in sedimentary research will only be realised if more thorough and systematic approaches to data collection, processing and interpretation are adopted.

AB  - Changing of environmental conditions and shortage of water demands a system that can manage irrigation efficiently. Autonomous irrigation systems are developed to optimize water use for agricultural crops. In dry areas or in case of inadequate rainfall, irrigation becomes difficult. So, it needs to be automated for proper yield and handled remotely for farmer safety. The aim of this study is to review the needs of soil moisture sensors in irrigation, sensor technology and their applications in irrigation scheduling and, discussing prospects. The review further discusses the literature of sensors remotely communicating with self-propelled sprinkler irrigation systems, distributed wireless sensor networks, sensors and integrated data management schemes and autonomous sprinkler control options. On board and field-distributed sensors can collect data necessary for real-time irrigation management decisions and transmit the information directly or through wireless networks to the main control panel or base computer. Communication systems such as cell phones, satellite radios, and internet-based systems are also available allowing the operator to query the main control panel or base computer from any location at any time. Selection of the communication system for remote access depends on local and regional topography and cost. Traditional irrigation systems may provide unnecessary irrigation to one part of a field while leading to a lack of irrigation in other parts. New sensors or remotely sensing capabilities are required to collect real time data for crop growth status and other parameters pertaining to weather, crop and soil to support intelligent and efficient irrigation management systems for agricultural processes. Further development of wireless sensor applications in agriculture is also necessary for increasing efficiency, productivity and profitability of farming operations.

AB  - Puddled transplanted rice (Oryza sativa L.) followed by intensively tilled wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (R-W) is the most predominant cropping system and the lifeline for billions of people in South Asia. The cultivation of R-W system requires high amounts of water, nutrients and energy, resulting in increased production costs and increased emissions of greenhouse gases. There are also increasing concerns of yield stagnation or decline in the R-W system, with increasing environmental footprints. Hence, the sustainability of the R-W system in South Asia, particularly in the northwest Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs), has been questioned and heavily debated. Based on the findings from peer-reviewed literature, this review aims to identify unsustainability issues and research gaps in the R-W system and propose possible solutions to mitigate those issues and technological interventions to close the research gaps. Among the unsustainability issues that the review has identified are declining crop, water and land productivity, deterioration of soil health, emissions of greenhouse gases due to intensive tillage and residue burning, deepening of groundwater levels and shift in weed flora and development of herbicidal resistance in crops. Potential solutions or technological interventions to mitigate the unsustainability issues include resource conservation technologies (RCTs) such as rice residue management, reduced tillage, laser land leveling, soil matric potential based irrigation scheduling, delayed rice transplanting, cultivation on permanent raised beds, direct-seeded rice (DSR), mechanical transplanting of rice and crop diversification with legumes. These interventions have the potential to reduce energy, water and carbon (C) footprints from the R-W system. Rice residue retention with Happy Seeder and adoption of zero tillage (ZT) for wheat establishment have significantly lowered the environmental footprints, with increased soil C sequestration due to additions of large amounts of plant-mediated C input. Residue mulching has helped increase root length of wheat by similar to 25% and root length density by similar to 40% below 15 cm depth, compared to no mulching. The Happy Seeder saved similar to 30% of irrigation water due to reduction of soil evaporation by similar to 42-48 mm through residue mulching. Crop cultivation on permanent raised beds is less energy-intensive and results in similar to 7.8-22.7% higher water use efficiency yet crop productivity in long run could be affected due to reduced root growth on beds. The puddled transplanted rice (PTR) established under wet tillage, however, can decrease the water percolation losses by 14-16% and crop water demand by similar to 10-25%, and it forms hard pan in soil plough (7-10 cm) layer due to increased soil bulk density. Water stagnation under continuously flooded PTR is the major source of methane emissions with serious environmental implications. Methane emissions from flooded rice can increase global warming potential by 18.1-27.6% compared to intermittently flooded rice with multiple aerations. The conventional tillage can favor the germination of grassy weeds in wheat, while the broad-leaved weeds increase under zero tillage. Zero tillage with mulch load conserved similar to 4.0% higher moisture due to similar to 2.3% lesser soil temperature and evaporated similar to 27.6% lesser than the conventional tillage. Delayed rice transplanting with short-duration variety has potential of saving of up to similar to 140 mm of irrigation water in the semiarid areas of NW IGPs.
   Although the DSR had lower yield potential than the PTR, it saved similar to 50% irrigation water. The laser land leveling technology saved similar to 30% irrigation water and similar to 25% electricity and had a yield advantage of similar to 4%, compared with PTR on un-leveled fields. The mechanical transplanted rice had higher grain yield and more water saving than the manual transplanting or DSR. The review demonstrates that a single technology may not be applicable everywhere and integrated approaches with the multiple criteria-productivity, economics, energy and environmental sustainability-would be required to address the unsustainability issues of the R-W system of the NW IGPs. There is a need to elucidate and disseminate various site- and context-specific RCTs appropriate for the region to address the unsustainability issues and challenges of the system. Sustainable R-W production technologies with reduced water, energy and C footprints are required for increased water and energy productivity and C sequestration for the NW IGPs of South Asia.

AB  - In this study, the Precipitation-Runoff Modelling System (PRMS) was used to simulate changes in surface-water depression storage in the 1,126-km(2) Upper Pipestem Creek basin located within the Prairie Pothole Region of North Dakota, USA. The Prairie Pothole Region is characterized by millions of small water bodies (or surface-water depressions) that provide numerous ecosystem services and are considered an important contribution to the hydrologic cycle. The Upper Pipestem PRMS model was extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey's (USGS) National Hydrologic Model (NHM), developed to support consistent hydrologic modelling across the conterminous United States. The Geospatial Fabric database, created for the USGS NHM, contains hydrologic model parameter values derived from datasets that characterize the physical features of the entire conterminous United States for 109,951 hydrologic response units. Each hydrologic response unit in the Geospatial Fabric was parameterized using aggregated surface-water depression area derived from the National Hydrography Dataset Plus, an integrated suite of application-ready geospatial datasets. This paper presents a calibration strategy for the Upper Pipestem PRMS model that uses normalized lake elevation measurements to calibrate the parameters influencing simulated fractional surface-water depression storage. Results indicate that inclusion of measurements that give an indication of the change in surface-water depression storage in the calibration procedure resulted in accurate changes in surface-water depression storage in the water balance. Regionalized parameterization of the USGS NHM will require a proxy for change in surface-storage to accurately parameterize surface-water depression storage within the USGS NHM.

AB  - Research and practice in Canadian forest vegetation management was reviewed for the period 1990 to present. Results indicate continued evolution toward a more integrated and ecologically sound program with appropriate focus on key competitors and crop species. Increasing collaboration between academia, government and industry has resulted in >666 new scientific publications, substantially augmenting the existing knowledge base. The development of (Chondrostereum purpureum) as the first biocontrol agent in Canadian forest vegetation management and the use of nutrient-loaded seedlings to enhance establishment success are considered key research highlights. Recent trends in operational practice include a move toward more intensive management on higher quality sites and adoption of innovative approaches (e.g. nutrient loaded seedlings, larger planting stock) and advanced technologies (e.g. electronic guidance in aerial herbicide applications). The lack of long-term growth response data and economic analyses demonstrating positive cost/benefits remain as shortcomings, however continued development of the program will undoubtedly enhance sustainable wood supply and minimize impact on the forest environment.

AB  - Tillage and fertilization methods may affect soil fertility. With the aim of assessing changes in soil chemical properties over a period of ten years, soil samples of a Paleudult were collected over nine seasons at three layer depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20 cm) and were chemically analyzed. Grain yield and nutrient export in two summer crops, soybean (Glycine max) and corn (Zea mays), in a field experiment set in Eldorado do Sul, in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, were determined. Three soil tillage systems were evaluated, conventional (CT), reduced (RT) and no-tillage (NT), combined with mineral (lime and fertilizers) and organic (poultry litter) fertilization. The no-tillage system stood out as compared to the others, especially in the surface layer, in terms of values of organic matter, soil pH, available phosphorus, cation exchange capacity and base saturation. Phosphorus content was higher under organic than mineral fertilization due to the criteria used for the establishment of fertilizer doses. Under organic fertilization, soil pH values were similar to those obtained in limed soil samples because of the cumulative effect of the organic fertilizer. Soybean yield was lower under NT in comparison to the RT and CT systems. Consequently, soybean grain exported a lower content of nutrients than maize grain. Maize yield was not affected by either tillage or fertilization systems.

AB  - Catchment-scale water quality models are increasingly popular tools for exploring the potential effects of land management, land use change and climate change on water quality. However, the dynamic, catchment-scale nutrient models in common usage are complex, with many uncertain parameters requiring calibration, limiting their usability and robustness. A key question is whether this complexity is justified. To explore this, we developed a parsimonious phosphorus model, SimplyP, incorporating a rainfall-runoff model and a biogeochemical model able to simulate daily streamflow, suspended sediment, and particulate and dissolved phosphorus dynamics. The model's complexity was compared to one popular nutrient model, INCA-P, and the performance of the two models was compared in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. For three land use classes, less than six SimplyP parameters must be determined through calibration, the rest may be based on measurements, while INCA-P has around 40 unmeasurable parameters. Despite substantially simpler process-representation, SimplyP performed comparably to INCA-P in both calibration and validation and produced similar long-term projections in response to changes in land management. Results support the hypothesis that INCA-P is overly complex for the study catchment. We hope our findings will help prompt wider model comparison exercises, as well as debate among the water quality modeling community as to whether today's models are fit for purpose. Simpler models such as SimplyP have the potential to be useful management and research tools, building blocks for future model development (prototype code is freely available), or benchmarks against which more complex models could be evaluated.
   Plain Language Summary Catchment models may be useful tools for managing water quality, for example for exploring how water quality may change in the future under different land management, land use or climate. However, models are only useful if they capture the right processes, otherwise there is a risk of management decisions being based on unreliable information. There is now a growing awareness that many catchment water quality models used today are too complex. This makes it difficult, time-consuming and expensive to set models up, and reduces the reliability of their predictions. We have therefore developed a new, simple model to predict phosphorus concentrations in rivers, one of the biggest causes of troublesome algal blooms in fresh waters. The simple model was compared with one of the standard models in common use and was found to perform as well, despite being substantially simpler to set up and use. This supports the idea that current water quality models are too complex, and that modelers need to put more effort into assessing whether they are using appropriate tools.

AB  - Controlling dissolved phosphorus (P) losses to surface waters is challenging as most conservation practices are only effective at preventing particulate P losses. As a result, P removal structures were developed to filter dissolved P from drainage water before reaching a water body. While many P removal structures with different P sorption materials (PSMs) have been constructed over the past two decades, there remains a need to evaluate their performances and compare on a normalized basis. The purpose of this review was to compile performance data of pilot and field-scale P removal structures and present techniques for normalization and comparison. Over 40 studies were normalized by expressing cumulative P removal as a function of cumulative P loading to the contained PSM. Results were further analyzed as a function of retention time (RT), inflow P concentration, and type of PSM. Structures treating wastewater were generally more efficient than non-point drainage water due to higher RT and inflow P concentrations. For Ca-rich PSMs, including slag, increased RT allowed for greater P removal. Among structures with low RT and inflow P concentrations common to non-point drainage, Fe-based materials had an overall higher cumulative removal efficiency compared to non-slag and slag materials.

AB  - Water availability is endangering the production, quality, and economic viability of growing wine grapes worldwide. Climate change projections reveal warming and drying trends for the upcoming decades, constraining the sustainability of viticulture. In this context, a great research effort over the last years has been devoted to understanding the effects of water stress on grapevine performance. Moreover, irrigation scheduling and other management practices have been tested in order to alleviate the deleterious effects of water stress on wine production. The current manuscript provides a comprehensive overview of the advances in the research on optimizing water management in vineyards, including the use of novel technologies (modeling, remote sensing). In addition, methods for assessing vine water status are summarized. Moreover, the manuscript will focus on the interactions between grapevine water status and biotic stressors. Finally, future perspectives for research are provided. These include the performance of multifactorial studies accounting for the interrelations between water availability and other stressors, the development of a cost-effective and easy-to-use tool for assessing vine water status, and the study of less-known cultivars under different soil and climate conditions.

AB  - Enhanced citrate release from crop roots has been one of the recent breeding targets for increased phosphorus (P) use efficiency (PUE), due to the potential of root citrate to solubilise soil P. However, it is unclear about the level of citrate efflux required to significantly impact on crop PUE in different soils. This paper presents a modelling approach to assess the field level impact of root exudates on crop PUE. The farming systems model, APSIM, was modified to include the effect of root citrate efflux on P availability in soil, crop P uptake and growth. With parameters derived from literature, the model was used to simulate the long-term impact of root citrate across soil and climatic conditions. Preliminary results showed contrasting long-term and short-term impacts due to either the accumulated effect of solubilisation or the depletion of soil P reserve. The major impact of enhanced citrate efflux is to increase the efficiency of applied R The enhanced model enables simulations of a wide range of combinations of Genotype by Environment by Management (GxExM) scenarios, to address knowledge gaps, and to assist in design of field testing for validating the performance of new wheat varieties across environments.

AB  - With the development of agroecosystem approaches, new cropping systems have to be designed to deliver multiple ecosystem services. In this context, we assessed four innovative cropping systems, designed to reach multiple environmental and production goals, in a long-term field experiment (2009-2020) at Grignon (France, N 48.84 degrees, E 1.95 degrees). A wide range of measurements were made, for nutrient cycles and organic matter in particular, for an analysis of interactions occurring during the emissions of greenhouse gases. We focus here on nitrogen (N) data collected over eight years (2009-2016). The data include: nitrous oxide fluxes (N2O), soil N contents (NO3- and NH4+), aboveground plant N content and biomass at maturity, yield, agricultural practices including N spreading, and climate. The four systems differ in terms of tillage practices, N inputs, and species, which is likely to affect soil N. Field data were collected and N2O fluxes were calculated. These original new cropping systems are innovating, resulting in new combinations of agricultural practices. The data obtained could be used to improve models for parameterization and validation, and to increase the predictive accuracy of models of N losses in original condi-tions.

AB  - INCA-P is a dynamic, catchment-scale phosphorus model which has been widely applied during the last decade. Since its original release in 2002, the model structure and equations have been significantly altered during several development phases. Here, we provide the first full model description since 2002 and then test the latest version of the model (v1.4.4) in a small rural catchment in northeast Scotland. The particulate phosphorus simulation was much improved compared to previous model versions, whilst the latest sorption equations allowed us to explore the potential time lags between reductions in terrestrial inputs and improvements in surface water quality, an issue of key policy relevance. The model is particularly suitable for use as a research tool, but should only be used to inform policy and land management in data-rich areas, where parameters and processes can be well-constrained. More long-term data is needed to parameterise dynamic models and test their predictions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - A field study was conducted in northern France over two consecutive years to evaluate the combined effect of conventional tillage (CT) vs no till (NT) with or without cover crops (cc) and nitrogen (N) fertilization on various agronomic traits related to N use efficiency in winter wheat. Five years after conversion of CT to NT, significant increases in N use efficiency, N utilization efficiency, N agronomic efficiency, N partial factor productivity, N apparent recovery fraction and N remobilization were observed under three N fertilization regimes (0, 161, 215 kg ha(-1)). It was also observed that grain yield and grain N content were similar under CT and NT. The N nutrition index was higher under NT at the three rates of N fertilization. Moreover, N use efficiency related traits were increased in the presence of cc both under NT and CT. Thus, agronomic practices based on continuous NT in the presence of cc, appear to be promising strategies to increase N use efficiency in wheat, while reducing both the use and the loss of N-based fertilizers.

AB  - Reduced supplies of nitrogen (N) in many soils of southern Queensland that were cropped exhaustively with cereals over many decades have been the focus of much research to avoid declines in profitability and sustainability of farming systems. A 45-month period of mixed grass ( purple pigeon grass, Setaria incrassata Stapf; Rhodes grass, Chloris gayana Kunth.) and legume ( lucerne, Medicago sativa L.; annual medics, M. scutellata L. Mill. and M. truncatula Gaertn.) pasture was one of several options that were compared at a fertility-depleted Vertosol at Warra, southern Queensland, to improve grain yields or increase grain protein concentration of subsequent wheat crops. Objectives of the study were to measure the productivity of a mixed grass and legume pasture grown over 45 months ( cut and removed over 36 months) and its effects on yield and protein concentrations of the following wheat crops.
   Pasture production (DM t/ha) and aboveground plant N yield (kg/ha) for grass, legume ( including a small amount of weeds) and total components of pasture responded linearly to total rainfall over the duration of each of 3 pastures sown in 1986, 1987 and 1988. Averaged over the 3 pastures, each 100 mm of rainfall resulted in 0.52 t/ha of grass, 0.44 t/ha of legume and 0.97 t/ha of total pasture DM, there being little variation between the 3 pastures. Aboveground plant N yield of the 3 pastures ranged from 17.2 to 20.5 kg/ha per 100 mm rainfall. Aboveground legume N in response to total rainfall was similar (10.6 - 13.2 kg/ha. 100 mm rainfall) across the 3 pastures in spite of very different populations of legumes and grasses at establishment. Aboveground grass N yield was 5.2 - 7.0 kg/ha per 100mm rainfall.
   In most wheat crops following pasture, wheat yields were similar to that of unfertilised wheat except in 1990 and 1994, when grain yields were significantly higher but similar to that for continuous wheat fertilised with 75 kg N/ha. In contrast, grain protein concentrations of most wheat crops following pasture responded positively, being substantially higher than unfertilised wheat but similar to that of wheat fertilised with 75 kg N/ha. Grain protein averaged over all years of assay was increased by 25 - 40% compared with that of unfertilised wheat.
   Stored water supplies after pasture were < 134mm (< 55% of plant available water capacity); for most assay crops water storages were 67 - 110 mm, an equivalent wet soil depth of only 0.3 - 0.45 m. Thus, the crop assays of pasture benefits were limited by low water supply to wheat crops. Moreover, the severity of common root rot in wheat crop was not reduced by pasture - wheat rotation.

AB  - To better understand the mechanism of nitrogen (N) distribution, absorption, utilization and loss in fertilizer under different tillage practices, a study was conducted to quantitatively explore the fate of fertilizer N in the soil-plant-atmosphere using the N-15 labelling technique under the long-term conservation tillage experiment in Northeast China. The test crop used was corn. This study compared the residual amount of N-15 fertilizer in soil, the content of N-15 fertilizer N in particle organic nitrogen (PON), light fraction organic matter nitrogen (LFOMN) and heavy fraction organic matter N (HFOMN) under different tillage practices. In addition, N uptake, utilization and distribution by corn, the emission of N2O and the gas loss of fertilizer N, and the fertilizer N utilization rate were also taken into account. The results showed that no tillage (NT) had a significantly lower amount of residual N-15 fertilizer than a moldboard plow (MP) (p < 0.05). In general, the content under NT at the 0-30 cm soil layer was 7.85% lower than that of MP. NT led to significantly greater PON and LFOMN of soil organic N compared to MP (p < 0.05). N-15 from N uptake, fertilizer absorption and utilization under NT were significantly higher than that under MP (p < 0.05), the soil N absorbed by plants under NT or MP was greater than 70%. The distribution of N-15 from N fertilizer in each corn part increases in this order: seed > leave > sheath > stem > bract > ear; about 57.91-64.92% of N-15 is distributed in the grain. NT resulted in significantly lower average and cumulative N2O emissions than those from MP based on the static closed chamber approach (p < 0.05). The average and cumulative emissions of soil fertilizer N-15-N2O under MP were also significantly greater than that of NT. Among the N2O emissions, 15.3% and 22.98% came from fertilizer N under NT and MP, respectively. On average, 0.1-0.16% of fertilizer N was lost in the form of N2O. There was a significant difference in fertilizer utilization between NT and MP, and NT was 4.23% larger than MP (p < 0.05). These one year findings suggest that NT plays a positive role in improving the N absorption and utilization of fertilizer in a Chinese mollisol and long-term effects need to be further studied.

AB  - The use of winter cover crops enhances environmental benefits and, if properly managed, may supply economic and agronomic advantages. Nitrogen retained in the cover crop biomass left over the soil reduces soil N availability, which might enhance the N fertiliser use efficiency of the subsequent cash crop and the risk of depressive yield and pre-emptive competition. The main goal of this study was to determine the cover crop effect on crop yield, N use efficiency and fertiliser recovery in a 2-year study included in a long-term (10 years) maize/cover crop production system. Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) and vetch (Vicia sativa L), as cover crops, were compared with a fallow treatment during the maize intercropping period. All treatments were cropped following the same procedure, including 130 kg N ha(-1) with N-15 fertiliser. The N rate was reduced from the recommended N rate based on previous results, to enhance the cover crop effect. Crop yield and N uptake, soil N mineral and N-15 fertiliser recovered in plants and the soil were determined at different times. The cover crops behaved differently: the barley covered the ground faster, while the vetch attained a larger coverage and N content before being killed. Maize yield and biomass were not affected by the treatments. Maize N uptake was larger after vetch than after barley, while fallow treatment provided intermediate results. This result can be ascribed to N mineralization of vetch residues, which results in an increased N use efficiency of maize. All treatments showed low soil N availability after the maize harvest; however, barley also reduced the N in the upper layers before maize planting, increasing the risk of pre-emptive competition. In addition to the year-long effect of residue decomposition, there was a cumulative effect on the soil's capacity to supply N after 7 years of cover cropping, larger for the vetch than for the barley.

AB  - Conventionally bred (CHT) and genetically modified herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops have changed weed management practices and made an important contribution to the global production of some commodity crops. However, a concern is that farm management practices associated with the cultivation of herbicide-tolerant (HT) crops further deplete farmland biodiversity and accelerate the evolution of herbicide-resistant (HR) weeds. Diversification in crop systems and weed management practices can enhance farmland biodiversity, and reduce the risk of weeds evolving herbicide resistance. Therefore, HT crops are most effective and sustainable as a component of an integrated weed management (IWM) system. IWM advocates the use of multiple effective strategies or tactics to manage weed populations in a manner that is economically and environmentally sound. In practice, however, the potential benefits of IWM with HT crops are seldom realized because a wide range of technical and socio-economic factors hamper the transition to IWM. Here, we discuss the major factors that limit the integration of HT crops and their associated farm management practices in IWM systems. Based on the experience gained in countries where CHT or GMHT crops are widely grown and the increased familiarity with their management, we propose five actions to facilitate the integration of HT crops in IWM systems within the European Union.

AB  - The miniaturization and affordable production of integrated microelectronics have improved in recent years, making unmanned aerial systems (UAS) accessible to consumers and igniting their interest. Researchers have proposed UAS-based solutions for almost any conceivable problem, but the greatest impact will likely be in applications that exploit the unique advantages of the technology: work in dangerous or difficult-to-access areas, high spatial resolution and/or frequent measurements of environmental phenomena, and deployment of novel sensing technology over small to moderate spatial scales. Examples of such applications may be the identification of wetland areas and use of high-resolution spatial data for hydrological modeling. However, because of the large-and growing-assortment of aircraft and sensors available on the market, an evolving regulatory environment, and limited practical guidance or examples of wetland mapping with UAS, it has been difficult to confidently devise or recommend UAS-based monitoring strategies for these applications. This paper provides a comprehensive review of UAS hardware, software, regulations, scientific applications, and data collection/post-processing procedures that are relevant for wetland monitoring and hydrological modeling.

AB  - Corrosion is still the most common contributor to failures in Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), causing detrimental techno-socio-economic impacts. Although the corrosion process has been the subject of several studies, factors influencing this process remain a source of contention due to the complexity of the process and its influence by the surrounding environment. Considering the prior reviews, this comprehensive review is considered an early attempt to thoroughly cover the most influential corrosion factors in water pipelines. Corrosion factors have been classified into three main categories: 1) environmental factors; soil factors, external factors, and stray current factors; 2) pipe-related factors, and 3) operational factors. A fault tree analysis diagram was used to map, discuss, and analyze all significant corrosion causes of the buried water pipelines to facilitate easy visualization from basic factors to their intermediate and parent factors. Furthermore, the techno-socio-economic impacts of corrosion on water pipelines and beyond are appropriately addressed to demonstrate the issue's multi-dimensional importance. The research is expanded to rank these factors using the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process to provide a better understanding of the currently focused research investigation and to enable the extraction of gaps and existing limitations in scholarly literature. The findings revealed that water quality is the most investigated factor, followed by electrical infrastructure and soil quality. Conversely, operational factors exhibit the greatest relative weight (0.428), followed by environmental factors (0.337). These findings highlight areas where further research is needed, and the article proposes potential directions for future studies to address these gaps.

AB  - Peatlands are poorly represented in global Earth system modeling frameworks. Here we add a peatland-specific land surface hydrology module (PEAT-CLSM) to the Catchment Land Surface Model (CLSM) of the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) framework. The amended TOPMODEL approach of the original CLSM that uses topography characteristics to model catchment processes is discarded, and a peatland-specific model concept is realized in its place. To facilitate its utilization in operational GEOS efforts, PEAT-CLSM uses the basic structure of CLSM and the same global input data. Parameters used in PEAT-CLSM are based on literature data. A suite of CLSM and PEAT-CLSM simulations for peatland areas between 40 degrees N and 75 degrees N is presented and evaluated against a newly compiled data set of groundwater table depth and eddy covariance observations of latent and sensible heat fluxes in natural and seminatural peatlands. CLSM's simulated groundwater tables are too deep and variable, whereas PEAT-CLSM simulates a mean groundwater table depth of -0.20 m (snow-free unfrozen period) with moderate temporal fluctuations (standard deviation of 0.10 m), in significantly better agreement with in situ observations. Relative to an operational CLSM version that simply includes peat as a soil class, the temporal correlation coefficient is increased on average by 0.16 and reaches 0.64 for bogs and 0.66 for fens when driven with global atmospheric forcing data. In PEAT-CLSM, runoff is increased on average by 38% and evapotranspiration is reduced by 19%. The evapotranspiration reduction constitutes a significant improvement relative to eddy covariance measurements.

AB  - Pest resistance and water pollution are major issues caused by the excessive use of pesticides in intensive agriculture. The concept of integrated production system (IPS) has been thus designed to solve those issues and also to meet the need for better food quality and production. Methodologies such as agronomic diagnosis-based design, prototyping, and model-based design have been developed. Here we review the model-based design of IPS. We identify tools for the development of comprehensive models. Once comprehensive models have been developed, model-based design of IPS can be formulated as an optimization problem to be solved using different approaches. Thus, we review the choice of corresponding criteria, constraints, and mathematical formulations found in the literature. We analyze successful model-based design in transportation and drug development. We learn from these areas to overcome the inherent difficulties involved in the model-based design of IPS. We recommend the following major points: IPS model-based design should use integrative modeling platforms, process-oriented modeling, and object-oriented techniques to improve the genericity, modularity, reuse of crop models, and the data sharing. The spatial dimension of IPS has to be accounted for by making crop models spatially explicit. The design evaluation criteria have to be standardized and carefully chosen by promoting stakeholders involvement. The design of IPS should be formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem, for which non-aggregative approaches should be preferred. Finally, it is necessary to establish a true dialogue between prototyping and model-based design practitioners in order to test, and if necessary to improve, the proposed systems.

AB  - The legumes most often used in temperate pastures such as Trifolium subterraneum have relatively high external P requirements for maximum growth. We investigated root traits associated with P acquisition in current and novel pasture legumes, as well as temperate grasses which have lower P requirements.
   Thirteen legume species, two pasture grasses, and three high carboxylate-exuding crop species (Lupinus albus, L. angustifolius, Cicer arietinum) were grown in a glasshouse for six weeks. Rhizosphere carboxylates and root morphological traits were measured.
   Ornithopus spp. had rhizosphere carboxylates in similar quantities to the Lupinus spp. (> 40 mu mol g(-1) root dry mass). Trifolium subterraneum lines had relatively large average root diameter, reduced specific root length and very short average root hair length resulting in specific root hair cylinder volumes (RHCVs) only 14-20 % of the grasses. However, O. sativus, O. compressus and Biserrula pelecinus had specific RHCVs more comparable to the grasses.
   Novel pasture legume species with root morphology more comparable to that of grasses than T. subterraneum were identified. Of these, Ornithopus spp. were notable as they also had high rhizosphere carboxylates relative to root dry mass.

AB  - The phosphorus (P) availability in volcanic soils is a main limitation for permanent pasture growth. Phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) must be improved to increase forage production with minimum impact on the environment. The aim of the present study was to assess at field conditions the PUE, P uptake efficiency (PUPE), P utilization efficiency (PUTE), and the P nutrition index (PNI) on permanent pastures grown in different environments under different P rates and P sources. Three field experiments were conducted in Southern Chile. Treatments resulted from factorial combination of (i) two P sources (phosphate rock and triple superphosphate) and (ii) different P rates. High variations in PUPE (0.004-0.108 kg P uptake kg(-1) P available), PUTE (189-756 kg DM kg(-1) P uptake), PUE (1.3-42.7 kg DM kg(-1) P available), and PNI (0.32-1.33) were observed across experiments, P rates, and harvest dates. PUE was significantly related to PUPE. PUTE was related to PNI through a negative power function. Therefore, higher or lower PUTEs will be the result of pastures grown under P deficiency and luxury consumption conditions, respectively. A reference PUTE ranging from 212 to 321 kg DM kg(-1) P uptake is proposed for pastures grown under optimal P nutritional status. The present study is the first proposing the PNI as a valuable tool to assess not only the P nutrition status, but also the PUTE in response to management factors such as P fertilization and harvest dates.

AB  - Little information is currently available concerning the effects of varying flow rate on nutrient transport by overland flow. The objective of this study was to measure the effects of overland flow rate on nutrient transport following the application of beef cattle or swine manure to plots containing 0, 2, 4, or 8 Mg ha(-1) of corn residue. After addition of residue materials to 0.75 in wide by 2.0 in long plots, beef cattle or swine manure was added and the plots were then either disked or maintained in a no-till condition. Three 30 min simulated rainfall events, separated by 24 h intervals, were applied at an intensity of approximately 70 mm h(-1). The transport of dissolved phosphorus (L)P), particulate P (PP), total phosphorus (TP), NO3-N, NH4-N, total nitrogen (TN), and soil loss was measured. Nutrient load from the plots on which manure was applied was not significantly affected by the amount of corn residue on the soil surface. Transport of DP in runoff was greater under no-till than till conditions. Rate of overland flow significantly affected PP and TP load. The transport of NO3-N and TN was affected by runoff rate but was not significantly influenced by tillage. Both tillage and runoff rate were found to affect the transport of NH4-N in runoff. Soil loss was significantly influenced by the amount of residue on the soil surface and runoff rate. Tillage condition and runoff rate should be considered when nutrient transport from land application areas is estimated.

AB  - The sustainability of rainfed crops under semiarid conditions is threatened by low plant nitrogen (N) recovery as well as the potential loss of reactive N to the environment. A field 15N tracing experiment on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) under rainfed conditions was carried out to study how different tillage management practices and the use of the nitrification inhibitor DMPSA affected the fate of N. The experiment consisted of a factorial combi-nation of tillage (i.e., no tillage, NT, and conventional tillage, T) and fertilizer treatments (unfertilized control and ammonium nitrate, AN, with or without DMPSA). Single-labelled ammonium nitrate (15NH4NO3, 15AN, or NH eta 5NO3, A15N) was applied at top-dressing to microplots at a rate of 80 kg N ha-1. Our results show out that DMPSA modulates the nitrification process from both fertilizer-N and endogenous soil-N (which was the main contributor to plant N uptake and N2O emissions), affecting soil residual N at the end of the cropping period (i.e., higher topsoil retention of 15AN in DMPSA-amended plots). Generally, cumulative N2O emissions from fertilizer were derived from 15AN rather than from A15N, thus confirming the site-specific choice of the source of synthetic N as an effective N2O mitigation strategy. Two months after harvest, a rewetting event produced a remarkable N2O emission peak that drove total cumulative N2O emissions and was also mainly derived from endogenous N. These results suggest that dry seasons could decrease N2O losses after fertilization while causing critical peaks after rewetting, thus potentially limiting the effectiveness of mitigation strategies. The average plant N recovery from the synthetic fertilizer was 22.6%, while the use of DMPSA combined with NT enhanced plant N uptake from endogenous soil-N. This could be a result of the improved crop development and plant N acquisition under NT, consistent with the decrease of soil N retention for A15N in the deeper layer at the end of the experiment in the nontilled plots. This study contributes to the mechanistic understanding of the effect of nitrification inhibitors and tillage on N2O emissions, soil N dynamics and N plant recovery, revealing relevant effects of both man-agement strategies and a critical role of endogenous soil-N under dry rainfed conditions. It can be concluded that, under the conditions of our study, combining DMPSA with NT could help to improve plant N recovery, thus resulting in positive impacts on reactive N loss and climate change mitigation and adaptation.

AB  - Determining the age and sources of stream water is critical for understanding the watershed hydrological processes and biogeochemical cycle. In this study, daily isotope data of rainfall and runoff, as well as continuously monitored conductivity data from June to October in 2019 in-Laoyeling(LYL) watershed located in permafrost region of northeastern China were used to separate streamflow components through the application of two independent methods: isotope-based hydrograph separations (IHS) and the conductivity mass balance (CMB) methods. The results showed that stream water in a boreal forest watershed with permafrost of the Daxing'an Mountains is mainly composed of pre-event water. Although the IHS method is more sensitive and provides more details than the CMB method, the results of both methods show a similar trend. The average value of the young water fractions (Fyw) for those aged less than 65 days is 5.6%, while the mean transit time (MTT) was calculated to be 3.33 years. These findings enhance our understanding of the fundamental characteristics of runoff generation mechanisms and changes in runoff components in permafrost regions. Such knowledge is crucial for effective regional water resource management under the context of climate change, such as construction of water conservancy facilities and prediction of flood and drought disasters.

AB  - Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi colonization and function depend on soil water and nutrient supply. To study the effects of resource supply on ECM colonization and inorganic nitrogen (N) uptake by roots of Picea asperata seedlings, we conducted a study at the end of a 5-year long experiment consisting of five watering regimes (40, 50, 60, 80, and 100% of field capacity) and three NH4NO3 application rates (0 [N0], 20 [N1], and 40 [N2] g N m(-2) year(-1)). We measured fluxes of ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) into colonized and uncolonized roots using noninvasive microtest technology. We found that, across the N supply levels, ECM colonization rate increased by 53 +/- 14% from the highest to the lowest level of water supply. Across the watering regimes, the fraction of mycorrhizal root tips was 39 +/- 4% higher under native N supply compared to roots grown under N additions. As expected for conifers, both colonized and uncolonized roots absorbed NH4+ at a higher rate than NO3-. N additions reduced the instantaneous ion uptake rates of uncolonized roots grown under low water supply but enhanced the fluxes into roots grown under sufficient soil water availability. Soil water supply improves inorganic N uptake by uncolonized roots but reduces the efficiency of colonized roots. Under the lowest water supply regime, the uptake rate of NH4+ and NO3- by colonized roots was 40-80% of those by uncolonized roots, decreasing to 20-30% as soil water supply improved. Taken together, our results suggest that the role ectomycorrhizae play in the nutrient acquisition of P. asperata seedling likely diminishes with increasing availability of soil resources.

AB  - Winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and tallgrass prairie are common land cover types in the Southern Plains of the United States. During the last century, agricultural expansion into native grasslands was extensive, particularly managed pasture or winter wheat. In this study, we measured carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor (H2O) fluxes from winter wheat and tallgrass prairie sites in Central Oklahoma using the eddy covariance in 2015 and 2016. The objective of this study was to contrast CO2 and H2O fluxes between these two ecosystems to provide insights on the impacts of conversion of tallgrass prairie to winter wheat on carbon and water budgets. Daily net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) reached seasonal peaks of -9.4 and -8.8 g Cm-2 in 2015 and -6.2 and -7.5 g Cm-2 in 2016 at winter wheat and tall grass prairie sites, respectively. Both sites were net sink of carbon during their growing seasons. At the annual scale, the winter wheat site was a net source of carbon (56 +/- 13 and 33 +/- 9 g Cm-2 year(-1) in 2015 and 2016, respectively). In contrast, the tallgrass prairie site was a net sink of carbon (-128 +/- 69 and -119 +/- 53 g Cm-2 year(-1) in 2015 and 2016, respectively). Daily ET reached seasonal maximums of 6.0 and 5.3 mmday(-1) in 2015, and 7.2 and 8.2 mmday(-1) in 2016 at the winter wheat and tallgrass prairie sites, respectively. Although ecosystem water use efficiency (EWUE) was higher in winter wheat than in tallgrass prairie at the seasonal scale, summer fallow contributed higher water loss from the wheat site per unit of carbon fixed, resulting into lower EWUE at the annual scale. Results indicate that the differences in magnitudes and patterns of fluxes between the two ecosystems can influence carbon and water budgets. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The Canadian Land Data Assimilation System (CaLDAS) has been developed at the Meteorological Research Division of Environment Canada (EC) to better represent the land surface initial states in environmental prediction and assimilation systems. CaLDAS is built around an external land surface modeling system and uses the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) methodology. A unique feature of CaLDAS is the use of improved precipitation forcing through the assimilation of precipitation observations. An ensemble of precipitation analyses is generated by combining numerical weather prediction (NWP) model precipitation forecasts with precipitation observations. Spatial phasing errors to the NWP first-guess precipitation forecasts are more effective than perturbations to the precipitation observations in decreasing (increasing) the exceedance ratio (uncertainty ratio) scores and generating flatter, more reliable ranked histograms. CaLDAS has been configured to assimilate L-band microwave brightness temperature TB by coupling the land surface model with a microwave radiative transfer model. A continental-scale synthetic experiment assimilating passive L-band TBs for an entire warm season is performed over North America. Ensemble metric scores are used to quantify the impact of different atmospheric forcing uncertainties on soil moisture and TB ensemble spread. The use of an ensemble of precipitation analyses, generated by assimilating precipitation observations, as forcing combined with the assimilation of L-band TBs gave rise to the largest improvements in superficial soil moisture scores and to a more rapid reduction of the root-zone soil moisture errors. Innovation diagnostics show that the EnKF is able to maintain a sufficient forecast error spread through time, while soil moisture estimation error improvements with increasing ensemble size were limited.

AB  - Sustaining diverse, yet productive crop sequences that integrate break crops such as canola (Brassica napusL.) remains a critical challenge for farming systems in low-rainfall cropping environments. Recent advances in canola productivity through early sowing, understanding of critical stress periods, hybrid cultivars and improved nitrogen (N) fertilisation offer promise under many conditions but require careful adaptation for risky, low-rainfall environments. A series of eight experiments was implemented over four growing seasons (2015-18) in the low-rainfall environments of southern Australia to test combinations of sowing date, cultivar selection and N-management strategies. Simulation modelling extended the field experiment results, enabling a simple, whole-farm profit-risk analysis across growing season deciles. The aim was to identify combinations of practices where the potential production and risk were understood, thereby assisting management decisions in low-rainfall cropping systems. Earlier sowing (April) was generally beneficial but only where seasonal conditions led to successful establishment, meaning that the best fit for canola in low-rainfall environments is as an opportunity crop. A hybrid cultivar (triazine tolerant) did not provide a yield advantage in an early experiment, but productivity increases were measured with a modern hybrid cultivar (Clearfield) in a later experiment. Profit-risk analysis suggested that a yield advantage of >20% over open-pollinated cultivars needs to be sustained across the full range of season deciles to generate economic advantage. Although there was relative insensitivity to the timing of N application, an adequate dose of N, either through fertiliser or legume crops, was critical to improve canola productivity. We conclude that opportunities exist to make significant gains in yield (by up to 110% compared with current standard practice) and profit-risk outcomes (similar to 30% increased gross margins across all season types) for canola in low-rainfall environments by using a package of agronomic management decisions that includes early sowing on genuine establishment opportunities, hybrids that offer sustained yield benefits, and matching N dose from both fertiliser and legume crops to yield potential of the soil type and seasonal outlook.

AB  - The modelling and management of flood risk in urban areas are increasingly recognized as global challenges. The complexity of these issues is a consequence of the existence of several distinct sources of risk, including not only fluvial, tidal and coastal flooding, but also exposure to urban runoff and local drainage failure, and the various management strategies that can be proposed. The high degree of vulnerability that characterizes such areas is expected to increase in the future due to the effects of climate change, the growth of the population living in cities, and urban densification. An increasing awareness of the socio-economic losses and environmental impact of urban flooding is clearly reflected in the recent expansion of the number of studies related to the modelling and management of urban flooding, sometimes within the framework of adaptation to climate change. The goal of the current paper is to provide a general review of the recent advances in flood-risk modelling and management, while also exploring future perspectives in these fields of research.

AB  - Continuous cultivation and cereal cropping of southern Queensland soils previously supporting native vegetation have resulted in reduced soil nitrogen supply, and consequently decreased cereal grain yields and low grain protein. To enhance yields and protein concentrations of wheat, management practices involving N fertiliser application, with no-tillage and stubble retention, grain legumes, and legume leys were evaluated from 1987 to 1998 on a fertility-depleted Vertosol at Warra, southern Queensland. The objective of this study was to examine the effect of lucerne in a 2-year lucerne-wheat rotation for its nitrogen and disease-break benefits to subsequent grain yield and protein content of wheat as compared with continuous wheat cropping.
   Dry matter production and nitrogen yields of lucerne were closely correlated with the total rainfall for October-September as well as March-September rainfall. Each 100 mm of total rainfall resulted in 0.97 t/ha of dry matter and 26 kg/ha of nitrogen yield. For the March-September rainfall, the corresponding values were 1.26 t/ha of dry matter and 36 kg/ha of nitrogen yield. The latter values were 10% lower than those produced by annual medics during a similar period. Compared with wheat-wheat cropping, significant increases in total soil nitrogen were observed only in 1990, 1992 and 1994 but increases in soil mineralisable nitrogen were observed in most years following lucerne. Similarly, pre-plant nitrate nitrogen in the soil profile following lucerne was higher by 74 kg/ha (9-167 kg N/ha) than that of wheat-wheat without N fertiliser in all years except 1996. Consequently, higher wheat grain protein ( 7 out of 9 seasons) and grain yield ( 4 out of 9 seasons) were produced compared with continuous wheat. There was significant depression in grain yield in 2 (1993 and 1995) out of 9 seasons attributed to soil moisture depletion and/or low growing season rainfall. Consequently, the overall responses in yield were lower than those of 50 kg/ha of fertiliser nitrogen applied to wheat-wheat crops, 2-year medic-wheat or chickpea-wheat rotation, although grain protein concentrations were higher following lucerne.
   The incidence and severity of the soilborne disease, common root rot of wheat caused by Bipolaris sorokiniana, was generally higher in lucerne-wheat than in continuous wheat with no nitrogen fertiliser applications, since its severity was significantly correlated with plant available water at sowing. No significant incidence of crown rot or root lesion nematode was observed. Thus, productivity, which was mainly due to nitrogen accretion in this experiment, can be maintained where short duration lucerne leys are grown in rotations with wheat.

AB  - Maize (Zea Mays L.) yield responsiveness to nitrogen (N) fertilization depends on the yield under non-limiting N supply as well as on the inherent productivity under zero N fertilizer (Y-0). Understanding the driving factors and developing predictive algorithms for Y-0 will enhance the optimization of N fertilization in maize. Using a random forest algorithm, we analyzed data from 679 maize N fertilization studies (1031 Y-0 observations) conducted between 1999-2019 in the United States and Canada. Predictability of Y-0 was assessed while identifying determinant factors such as soil, crop management, and weather. The inclusion of weather variables as predictors improved the model efficiency (ME) from 51 up to 64 %, and reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) from 2.5 to 2.0 Mg ha(-1), 34 to 27 % in relative terms (RRMSE). The most relevant predictors of Y-0 were previous crop, irrigation, and soil organic matter (SOM), while the most influential weather data was linked to the radiation per unit of thermal time (Q quotient) around flowering and spring precipitations. The crop rotation effect resulted in Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) as the previous crop with the highest Y-0 level (IQR = 11.5-15.0 Mg ha(-1)) as compared to annual legumes (IQR = 5.6-10.0 Mg ha(-1)) and other previous crops (IQR = 3.6-7.8 Mg ha(-1)). The Q quotient around flowering positively affected Y-0, while spring precipitations and extreme temperature events during grain filling showed a negative association to Y-0. Overall, these results reinforce the concept that yields are controlled not only by soil N supply but also by factors modifying plant demand and ability to capture N. Lastly, we foresee a promising future for the use of machine learning to address both prediction and interpretation of maize yield to obtain more reliable N guidelines.

AB  - Environmental monitoring plays a central role in diagnosing climate and management impacts on natural and agricultural systems; enhancing the understanding of hydrological processes; optimizing the allocation and distribution of water resources; and assessing, forecasting, and even preventing natural disasters. Nowadays, most monitoring and data collection systems are based upon a combination of ground-based measurements, manned airborne sensors, and satellite observations. These data are utilized in describing both small-and large-scale processes, but have spatiotemporal constraints inherent to each respective collection system. Bridging the unique spatial and temporal divides that limit current monitoring platforms is key to improving our understanding of environmental systems. In this context, Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) have considerable potential to radically improve environmental monitoring. UAS-mounted sensors offer an extraordinary opportunity to bridge the existing gap between field observations and traditional air-and space-borne remote sensing, by providing high spatial detail over relatively large areas in a cost-effective way and an entirely new capacity for enhanced temporal retrieval. As well as showcasing recent advances in the field, there is also a need to identify and understand the potential limitations of UAS technology. For these platforms to reach their monitoring potential, a wide spectrum of unresolved issues and application-specific challenges require focused community attention. Indeed, to leverage the full potential of UAS-based approaches, sensing technologies, measurement protocols, postprocessing techniques, retrieval algorithms, and evaluation techniques need to be harmonized. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the existing research and applications of UAS in natural and agricultural ecosystem monitoring in order to identify future directions, applications, developments, and challenges.

AB  - The Asian Precipitation Experiment (AsiaPEX) was initiated in 2019 to understand terrestrial precipitation over diverse hydroclimatological conditions for improved predictions, disaster reduction, and sustainable development across Asia under the framework of the Global Hydroclimatology Panel (GHP)/Global Energy and Water Exchanges (GEWEX). AsiaPEX is the successor to GEWEX Asian Monsoon Experiment (GAME; 1995-2005) and Monsoon Asian Hydro-Atmosphere Scientific Research and Prediction Initiative (MAHASRI; 2006-16). While retaining the key objectives of the aforementioned projects, the scientific targets of AsiaPEX focus on land-atmosphere coupling and improvements to the predictability of the Asian hydroclimatological system. AsiaPEX was designed for both fine-scale hydroclimatological processes occurring at the land surface and the integrated Asian hydroclimatological system characterized by multiscale interactions. We adopt six approaches including observation, process studies, scale interactions, high-resolution hydrological modeling, field campaigns, and climate projection, which bridge gaps in research activities conducted in different regions. Collaboration with mesoscale and global modeling researchers is one of the core methods in AsiaPEX. We review these strategies based on the literature and our initial outcomes. These include the estimation and validation of high -resolution satellite precipitation, investigations of extreme rainfall mechanisms, field campaigns over the Maritime Continent and Tibetan Plateau, areas of significant impact on the entire AsiaPEX region, process studies on diurnal-to interdecadal-scale interactions, and evaluation of the pre-dictabilities of climate models for long-term variabilities. We will conduct integrated observational and modeling initiative, the Asian Monsoon Year (AMY)-II around 2025-28, whose strategies are the subregional observation platforms and integrated global analysis.

AB  - Organic phosphorus (OP) is one of the main forms of phosphorus in lake ecosystems. Mounting evidence has shown that sediment OP has become a major but underestimated issue in addressing lake eutrophication and algal bloom. However, a holistic view of sediment OP remains missing. This review aims to provide an overview of progress on the studies of OP in lake sediments, focusing on the contribution of OP to internal P loading, its potential role in algal bloom, and the migration and transformation. In addition, this work systematically summarized current methods for characterizing OP content, chemical fraction, composition, bioavailability, and assessment of OP release in sediment, with the pros and cons of each method being discussed. In the end, this work pointed out following efforts needed to deepen the understanding of sediment OP, namely: (1) In-depth literature review from a global perspective regarding the contribution of sediment OP to internal P loading with further summary about its pattern of distribution, accumulation and historical changes; (2) better mathematical models for describing drivers and the linkages between the biological pump of algal bloom and the replenishment of sediment OP; (3) fully accounting the composition and molecular size of OP for better understanding its transformation process and mechanism; ; (4) developing direct, high-sensitivity and combined techniques to improve the precision for identifying OP in sediments; (5) establishing the response of OP molecular properties and chemical reactivity to OP biodegradability and designing a comprehensive and accurate composite index to deepen the understanding for the bioavailability of OP; and (6) integrating fundamental processes of OP in current models to better describe the release and exchange of P in sediment-water interface (SWI). This work is expected to provide critical information about OP properties and deliver perspectives of novel characterization methods.

AB  - Throughout the savanna biome, woody vegetation is cleared to increase productivity of herbaceous pasture. While clearing can result in increased pasture production of semi-arid dystrophic savannas in the short term, it is uncertain whether production is sustained in the long term. There is insufficient knowledge of how clearing affects soil nutrient and organic carbon (SOC) stocks. Using cleared-uncleared site pairs, we evaluated techniques for time-integrated assessment of nutrient and carbon relations in Australian savanna. Short-term in situ resin incubation showed that soil at cleared sites had a higher time-integrated availability of ammonium and nitrate, indicating that nitrogen (N) may turn over faster and/or is taken up slower at cleared sites than uncleared savanna. Nitrate and ammonium availability was approximately 2-fold higher in spring than in summer, likely due to greater uptake and/or loss of nitrate during summer rains. Nitrate was a prominent N source for evergreen trees, especially before summer rain, pointing to a role of trees as permanent N sinks. Stable isotope signatures of soil and vegetation indicate that N input occurs via N-2 fixing microbiotic crusts and Acacia species. 30 years after clearing, SOC contained more C-4 grass-derived carbon than uncleared savanna, but this shift in C source was not associated with the net C gain often observed in grasslands. Interactions between altered nutrient and C relations and composition of the understorey should be assessed in context of introduced buffelgrass (Cenchrus ciliaris) which had higher macronutrient concentrations than native grasses. Heterogeneity of the studied soils highlights the need for replication at several spatial scales to infer long-term dynamics with space-for-time chronosequences. We conclude that the techniques presented here are useful for gaining knowledge of the biogeochemical processes governing savannas and the systems that result from clearing.

AB  - An experiment at 3 sites (Birchip, Elmore and Speed) in the northern Victorian cropping belt compared dry matter (DM) production of short-term (2 year) pastures and their contributions to soil mineral nitrogen (N) and subsequent wheat and barley production. The pastures included different varieties of subterranean clover, annual medic and lucerne, and these were compared with ryegrass-dominant pasture, which represented the experimental control.
   More productive legume pastures generally resulted in greater accumulation of soil mineral N at sowing of the following cereal at both Elmore and Speed; however, at Birchip, soil mineral N remained high under all treatments. At Elmore and Speed, significant (P < 0.10) positive relationships were observed between available N at sowing and subsequent wheat and barley production. Cereal grain yield at Birchip was not associated with available N at sowing.
   The quantities of soil mineral N available at sowing (152 kg/ha) of the cereals were in excess of crop demand at Birchip. At Elmore, the soil mineral N supply (83 kg/ha) was below that required for wheat and barley to reach their water- limited potential yield (20 kg grain/mm of growing season rainfall). However, at Speed, the supply of soil mineral N (63 kg/ha) was sufficient to achieve the water-limited potential grain yield and to produce malting-grade barley, but not sufficient to elevate wheat grain protein concentrations above 11.5%.
   In environments with low soil N levels, the amount of residual N following short-term pastures increased the availability of N to following cereals. Whether this is sufficient to satisfy subsequent crop demand is largely determined by water availability in the year of cropping. In cases where available N is already high, short-term pasture phases may have little effect on increasing crop production.

AB  - The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) standard methodology to conduct national inventories of soil N2O emissions is based on default (or Tier I) emission factors for various sources. The objective of our study was to summarize recent N2O flux data from agricultural legume crops to assess the emission factor associated with rhizobial nitrogen fixation. Average N2O emissions from legumes are 1.0 kg N ha(-1) for annual crops, 1.8 kg N ha(-1) for pure forage crops and 0.4 kg N ha(-1) for grass legume mixes. These values are only slightly greater than background emissions from agricultural crops and are much lower that those predicted using 1996 IPCC methodology. These field flux measurements and other process-level studies offer little support for the use of an emission factor for biological N fixation (BNF) by legume crops equal to that for fertiliser N. We conclude that much of the increase in soil N2O emissions in legume crops may be attributable to the N release from root exudates during the growing season and from decomposition of crop residues after harvest, rather than from BNF per se. Consequently, we propose that the biological fixation process itself be removed from the IPCC N2O inventory methodology, and that N2O emissions induced by the growth of legume crops be estimated solely as a function of crop residue decomposition using an estimate of above- and below-ground residue inputs, modified as necessary to reflect recent findings on N allocation.

AB  - Nitrogen (N) management is critical to the profitability of grain production systems, however careful management of fertiliser is needed to minimise environmental impacts. We investigated the effect of five N fertilisation strategies on nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of rainfed wheat grown on a clay soil in a temperate, semi-arid environment of south eastern Australia during 2013 and 2014. Treatments included urea application (50kgN/ha) at sowing with and without nitrification inhibitor (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate) and surface broadcasting of urea with and without urease inhibitor (n-butyl thiophosphoric triamide) at the end of tillering plus an unfertilised control. Daily N2O emissions were low and responsive to in-season rainfall and fertiliser addition at sowing. Cumulative emissions from sowing until harvest were highest where N was applied at sowing in 2013; 160g N2O-N/ha, while the 0N control emitted 28gN(2)O-N/ha (over 201days). Emissions during 2014 were 77% lower than 2013 due to dry seasonal conditions; cumulative emissions were 49gN(2)O-N/ha where N was applied at sowing, with background emissions of around 0gN(2)O-N/ha (over 177days). Inhibitors showed limited scope for reducing N2O emissions in this environment, however deferring N application until the end of tillering reduced N2O emissions. Grain yield responses to fertiliser were significant; increasing grain yield by 11-31% and NUE was generally high (recovery efficiency>68%). However, deferring N application until the end of tillering in 2014 reduced yield (-19%) and recovery of applied N (-74%).

AB  - Low-input and organic farming systems have notable differences in nitrogen (N) sources, cycling and management strategies compared to conventional systems with high inputs of synthetic N fertilizer. In low-input and organic systems, there is greater reliance on complex rotations including annual and perennial crops, organic N sources, and internal N cycling that more closely mimic natural systems. These differences in farming system practices fundamentally affect N availability and N use efficiency (NUE) and could impact crop traits and breeding strategies required to optimize NUE. We assess genetic and environmental factors that could assist breeders in improving crop performance in low-input and organic farming systems by examining NUE in natural and agricultural ecosystems. Crop plants have often been bred for high N productivity, while plants adapted to low N ecosystems often have lower productivity and higher levels of internal N conservation. Breeders can potentially combine N productivity and N conservation through the use of elite and wild germplasm. Beneficial genetic traits include the ability to maintain photosynthesis and N uptake under N stress and the ability to extract soil N at low concentrations, perhaps through beneficial associations with soil microorganisms. In addition, breeding for specific adaptation to climactic and management practices so that crop uptake patterns match N availability patterns, while minimizing pathways of N loss, will be critical to improving NUE.

AB  - Several new and existing short-term forage legumes could be used to provide nitrogen (N) inputs for grain crops in subtropical farming systems. The fixed-N inputs from summer-growing forage legumes lablab (Lablab purpureus), burgundy bean (Macroptilium bracteatum) and lucerne (Medicago sativa) and winter-growing legume species snail medic (Medicago scutellata), sulla (Hedysarum coronarium) and purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis) were compared over several growing seasons at four locations in southern Queensland, Australia. Available soil mineral N and grain yield of a following cereal crop were compared among summer-growing legumes and forage sorghum (Sorghum spp. hybrid) and among winter-growing legumes and forage oats (Avena sativa). In the first year at all sites, legumes utilised the high initial soil mineral N, with <30% of the legume N estimated to have been derived from atmospheric N-2 (%Ndfa) and legume-fixed N <30kg/ha. In subsequent years, once soil mineral N had been depleted, %Ndfa increased to 50-70% in the summer-growing legumes and to 60-80% in winter-growing legumes. However, because forage shoot N was removed, rarely did fixed N provide a positive N balance. Both lablab and burgundy bean fixed up to 150kgN/ha, which was more than lucerne in all seasons. Prior to sowing cereal grain crops, soil nitrate was 30-50kg/ha higher after summer legumes than after forage sorghum. At one site, lablab and lucerne increased the growth and yield of a subsequent grain sorghum crop by 1.4t/ha compared with growth after forage sorghum or burgundy bean. Of the winter-growing legumes, sulla had the highest total N-2 fixation (up to 150kgN/ha.year) and inputs of fixed N (up to 75kgN/ha), and resulted in the highest concentrations of soil N (80-100kgN/ha more than oats) before sowing of the following crop. Wheat protein was increased after winter legumes, but there was no observed yield benefit for wheat or grain sorghum crops. New forage legume options, lablab, burgundy bean and sulla, showed potential to increase N supply in crop rotations in subtropical farming systems, contributing significant fixed N (75-150kg/ha) and increasing available soil N for subsequent crops compared to non-legume forage crops. However, high soil mineral N (>50kgN/ha) greatly reduced N-2 fixation by forage legumes, and significant N-2 fixation only occurred once legume shoot N uptake exceeded soil mineral N at the start of the growing season. Further work is required to explore the impact of different management strategies, such as livestock grazing rather than harvesting for hay, on the long-term implications for nutrient supply for subsequent crops.

AB  - Despite increasing interest in organic grain crop production, there is inadequate information regarding the performance of organically-produced grain crops in the United States, especially in Coastal Plain soils of the mid-Atlantic region. We report on corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) yields at the USDA-ARS Beltsville Farming Systems Project (FSP), a long-term cropping systems trial established in Maryland in 1996 to evaluate the sustainability of organic and conventional grain crop production. The five FSP cropping systems include a conventional no-till corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (NT), a conventional chisel-till corn-soybean-wheat/soybean rotation (CT), a 2-yr organic corn-soybean rotation (Org2), a 3-yr organic corn-soybean-wheat rotation (Org3), and a 4- to 6-yr organic corn-soybean-wheat-hay rotation (Org4+). Average corn grain yield during 9 yr was similar in NT and CT (7.88 and 8.03 Mg ha(-1), respectively) but yields in Org2, Org3, and Org4+ were, respectively, 41, 31, and 24% less than in CT. Low N availability explained, on average, 73% of yield losses in organic systems relative to CT while weed competition and plant population explained, on average, 23 and 4%, respectively, of these yield losses. The positive relationship between crop rotation length and corn yield among organic systems was related to increasing N availability and decreasing weed abundance with increasing rotation length. Soybean yield averaged 19% lower in the three organic systems (2.88 Mg ha(-1)) than in the conventional systems (3.57 Mg ha(-1)) and weed competition alone accounted for this difference. There were no consistent differences in wheat yield among cropping systems. Crop rotation length and complexity had little impact on soybean and wheat yields among organic systems. Results indicate that supplying adequate N for corn and controlling weeds in both corn and soybean are the biggest challenges to achieving equivalent yields between organic and conventional cropping systems.

AB  - The role of the land surface in climate and weather has been a major research focus since the 1970s. Since that time our understanding of the issue has greatly changed and many new themes in several disciplines are being considered. This article summarizes the changes in our understanding that have taken place in research on this topic and reviews principally papers that have appeared in the last two decades. Several other papers provide comprehensive reviews of literature that appeared prior to that time. The major changes that have occurred include 1) more sophisticated and rigorous analysis of desertification, 2) increased emphasis on hydrological processes, including the role of groundwater, 3) use of multi-model ensembles and regional models, 4) the emergence of the domain of ecohydrology, with emphasis on detailed feedbacks between water availability and vegetation, 5) examination of the hypothesis that vegetation feedback can produce abrupt climate change, 6) emphasis on the impacts on convective or synoptic-scale systems, and 7) consideration of the impact of aerosols, including the Saharan Air Layer. With the exception of desertification, each of these topics is reviewed. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fine roots are a dominant, but often overlooked source of carbon (C) in forest soils, and decomposition of this material may have important consequences for C storage and turnover in forest ecosystems. Forest harvesting modifies soil physicochemical properties and microbial communities, which may lead to faster decomposition rates, but the effect of harvesting on fine-root decomposition is rarely investigated. Variable-retention harvesting, where some trees are left on site after harvest, often results in lower soil moisture and temperature, and increased ectomycorrhizal diversity relative to clearcut harvesting. As such, this harvesting practice may influence fine-root decomposition rates. In Douglas-fir forests in coastal British Columbia, we measured fine-root (< 2 mm diameter) decomposition rates in variable-retention (aggregate and dispersed arrangements), clearcut, and uncut treatments, and determined if any effects persisted as stands aged. Within the variable-retention treatments, we also examined if fine-root decomposition rates varied with distance from retention trees or retention patches. Further, we determined which soil physicochemical variables best explained variation in fine-root carbon loss after two years of decomposition. Increased tree coverage slowed fine root decomposition; fine roots decomposed as slowly under variable-retention treatments as in uncut stands, and 15-19% more carbon was retained in these treatments relative to the clearcut treatment. Fine roots also decomposed faster with increasing distance from retention patches or retention trees as decomposition was twofold slower in the aggregate centre relative to open areas, with similar patterns observed in the dispersed retention treatment. However, fine roots decomposed at similar rates in forests and stands with more advanced regeneration, suggesting the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates was not persistent. Across all sampling locations, 37% of the variation in fine-root carbon loss was explained by fine-root biomass, and nitrate, potassium and sulphate availability. Nitrate availability was also positively correlated with the proportional mass of carbon lost during the decomposition experiment, suggesting that fine-root decomposition is sensitive to harvesting-induced changes in soil physicochemistry, and that variable-retention harvesting moderates the effects of harvesting on decomposition rates. These findings indicate that shortly after harvest, retention of even single trees can prevent the increase in fine-root decomposition rates associated with clearcut harvesting in these coastal Douglas-fir forests. Accordingly, management practices such as variable-retention harvesting that retain some trees in a cutblock may reduce soil C losses following forest harvesting.

AB  - Animal manures are valuable multi-nutrient fertilizers, but their short-term nitrogen (N) use efficiency (NUE) by plants is low, bearing the potential of harmful N losses to the environment, such as nitrate (NO3-) leaching. To develop strategies to increase the NUE of cattle slurry, a comprehensive understanding of slurry N dynamics in the soil-plant system is needed. In a 57-day microcosm experiment in the greenhouse, we assessed the effect of different slurry treatments on slurry N turnover in the soil and its uptake by ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum var. Westerwoldicum). Employing a two-factorial design, N-15 cattle slurry (SLU), N-15 anaerobically digested cattle slurry (SLA), and N-15 anaerobically digested cattle slurry plus biochar (SLA+) were combined with and without the nitrification inhibitor 3,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrazole monophosphate (DMPP). As references, a mineral fertilizer (MIN) and an unfertilised treatment (N0) were included. The N-15 recovery, hence NUE, in plant biomass was higher for SLA than for SLU, while recovery in soil at 55 days after set-up showed an opposite trend, with over 45% of N from SLU still being recovered in soil. DMPP and biochar only marginally affected NUE and fertilizer N recovery in soil. Although N-15 recovery in soil was highest for SLU, residual N leaching from SLU was low (<1% of added N). We attribute this to the limited presence of slurry N in mineral forms at this point of time, with the majority being stored in the non-microbial organic soil N pool. Leaching of residual N from MIN was significantly higher for MIN than for SLU, while SLA and SLA+ ranged in between. Overall, anaerobic digestion appeared suitable for increasing NUE of cattle slurry, but further investigations under field conditions are necessary in order to assess its potential to reduce nitrate leaching in the long-term.

AB  - Natural variations in the stable isotope N-15 are often exploited in studies of N cycling in ecosystems. Lower N-15 natural abundance in non-legume plants growing in association with legumes, compared with the non-legume grown alone in pure stands have been observed in cropping, forage, and agroforestry systems. Such observations have frequently been attributed to the transfer of biologically-fixed nitrogen (N) from the legume to the companion non-legume, and various methodologies have been employed to calculate the extent of the N transfer. While some of these N-15 natural abundance-based estimates of N transfer were within the range previously reported using equivalent N-15-enriched techniques (<20% of non-legume plant N and <10 kg N ha(-1) derived from fixed N contributed by neighbouring legumes), many of the values obtained using natural abundance were much higher (30%-83% of the non-legume N derived from fixed N representing up to 30-40 kg N ha(-1)) than generally measured by N-15-enriched methods; with even greater estimates being determined where data were available to allow N transfer to be re-calculated on the basis of total legume N rather than fixed N (42% to >100%, and up to 110 kg N ha(-1) per year). This review raises concerns about the assumptions behind the natural abundance approach, and provides some alternative interpretations for the observed differences in natural N-15 abundance between plants grown in the presence and absence of legumes. It was concluded that simple comparative measures of non-legume delta N-15 alone cannot provide a quantitative estimate of N transfer between plant species if the dominant source and the isotopic identity of the transferred N cannot be validated, and if the extent of any isotopic fractionation associated with relevant N transformations occurring during transfer cannot be defined. To date this information is not forthcoming. There is a need to greatly improve our understanding of the transfer processes before the real value of the delta N-15 technology can be realized. In the first instance this will primarily be achieved by carefully executed experiments under controlled conditions, and in the field, employing both N-15 natural abundance and enrichment approaches so estimates of transfer can be compared, and the data interrogated using modelling approaches to explore isotopic fractionation.

AB  - Early agricultural practices in Queensland inadvertently led to accelerated soil erosion. During the 1940s, the Queensland Government initiated a soil conservation service that worked with the principles of matching land use with its capability, as well as runoff management using earth structures such as contour banks and grassed waterways. A concerted effort began in the 1960s to develop and adapt farming systems that maximised retention of crop residues to maintain surface cover to complement the earthworks. Investigation and promotion of farm machinery capable of dealing with high stubble levels commenced in the mid-1970s. Demonstrations of the benefits of reduced and no-tillage conservation farming practices for improved productivity and soil conservation also began at this time.
   The combined research, development and extension efforts of farmers, grower organisations, agribusiness and government agencies have contributed to an increase in the understanding of soil-water-crop interactions that have led to the adoption of no-tillage and conservation farming practices in Queensland. In 2005, the overall area under no-tillage was similar to 50% of the cropping land in the main grain growing areas of southern and central Queensland, but was potentially as high as 85% among some groups of farmers. Conservation farming practices, in their many forms, are now regarded as standard practice, and the agricultural advisory industry is involved considerably in providing advice on optimum herbicide application and crop rotation strategies for these practices.
   Factors hindering greater adoption of no-tillage include: farmer attitudes and aspirations, machinery conversion or replacement costs, buildup of soil and stubble-borne plant diseases, use of residual herbicides that may limit crop options, dual use of land for grazing and cropping, herbicide resistance, buildup of hard-to-kill weeds, the need for soil disturbance in some situations, and concerns by farmers about the effects of herbicides on the environment and human health.
   Developments that may aid further adoption of no-tillage systems include: ongoing machinery modifications that allow greater flexibility in the cropping systems, refinement of controlled traffic farming and precision agriculture, improved crop resistance or tolerance to plant diseases associated with stubble retention, availability of more crop options and rotations, development of a broader spectrum of effective herbicides and the use of genetic modification technologies to breed herbicide-resistant crops.

AB  - Canola has a high nitrogen requirement and optimal nitrogen (N) management in environments with variable rainfall is a challenge. This study investigated the impact of timing of N as a single or split application at different growth stages on seed yield, N uptake and water-use efficiency in canola. Nitrogen rates of 100 and 200 kg ha(-1) were applied after sowing when two leaves were unfolded or equally split between the rosette, green bud and first flower stages. The experiments were conducted at two sites with contrasting rainfall and a supplementary irrigation treatment at the low rainfall site, generating a third environment. Nitrogen application increased seed yield by up to 20% at a high rainfall site and by up to 77% at a medium rainfall site, but the timing of N did not significantly affect the yield response to N. Seed yield was closely associated with total dry matter production and seed m(-2). N-use efficiency was influenced more by N recovery and uptake efficiency, rather than physiological efficiency, which highlights the importance of soil moisture availability and the ability of the crop to exploit soil water and N reserves. The results suggest that better use of subsoil moisture by overcoming some of the subsoil constraints may be an avenue for further improvements in yield and nitrogen-use efficiency (NUE) of canola in this environment.

AB  - Strategic use of nitrogen (N) may improve N use efficiency, but there is limited information on the influence of N supply at crucial growth stages on N accumulation, water use, and water use efficiency of canola and mustard. In this study, we hypothesize that genetic variation among canola and mustard can alter the response of timing and rate of post-sowing N application at targeted phenological growth stages by improving N and water use and their efficiencies. Field experiments were conducted in South Australia during two growing seasons with contrasting water availabilities. Two mustard and four canola cultivars, including two triazine tolerant (TT) and two non-TT cultivars were evaluated under different post-sowing N application strategies comprising three N rates and different timings of application. Mustard used more water than canola in the season with higher rainfall, but canola and mustard used similar amounts of water in the drier season. Nitrogen increased the water use efficiency (WUE) of canola and mustard cultivars. Nitrogen rate and timing did not influence the total water use of canola and mustard but influenced the partitioning of pre- and post-flowering water use. Even though, highest N uptake was observed in the treatment with continuous supply of N with 200 kg N ha(-1)in five splits it did not influence the N efficiencies parameters which indicate that yield of canola and mustard are limited by N rate in these environments. In treatment with limited N supply, targeting N at the rosette stage improve N use efficiency of canola and mustard. However, the limited N uptake potential of mustard makes timing of N application the most important consideration whereas correct N rate should be main consideration for canola.

AB  - We characterized the epigeous macrofungus communities in two old-growth conifer forests by collecting sporocarps. Despite the similarity in dominant tree species in the two forests, the macrofungus communities were very different. At the drier, nitrogen-poor Deer Park area, the macrofungi were dominated by ectomycorrhizal species in the genera Cortinarius, Tricholoma, Hydnellum, Suillus, and Sarcodon. At the wetter, higher nitrogen Hoh Valley, the macrofungi were characterized by ectomycorrhizal species in different genera, such as Inocybe, Russula, Amanita, Boletus, and Phaeocollybia, and saprotrophic fungi accounted for a greater proportion of the community. Species richness was similar at the two areas, but sporocarp production was much higher at Deer Park. We propose that (i) these community differences developed over a long time; (ii) they are largely related to differences in ecosystem moisture and nitrogen abundance; and (iii) within the ectomycorrhizal fungi, possible causal mechanisms involve mycelial morphology and carbon allocation within the symbioses. The apparent response to relatively small but presumably long-term differences in nitrogen abundance suggests that sporocarp production by macrofungi could be an effective bioindicator and should be considered in determination of critical loads for atmospheric nitrogen deposition to temperate and boreal forests.

AB  - Biomass production, soil water extraction, and water-use efficiency (WUE, kg dry matter (DM)/ha.mm growing-season water use) of tropical, summer-growing and temperate, winter-growing forage legumes suited to short-term rotations with crops were compared over several growing seasons in southern Queensland. Tropical legumes lablab (Lablab purpureus cvv. Highworth and Endurance), burgundy bean (Macroptillium bracteatum cvv. Cardarga/Juanita mix), and butterfly pea (Clitoria ternatea cv. Milgara) were compared with forage sorghum (Sorghum spp. cv. Silk and cv. Sugargraze). Temperate legumes snail medic (Medicago scutellata cv. Sava), lucerne (Medicago sativa cv. UQL-1), sulla (Hedysarum coronarium cv. Wilpena), and purple vetch (Vicia benghalensis cv. Popany) were compared with forage oats (Avena sativa cv. Taipan/Genie). Production and WUE of winter legumes was highly variable, with oats producing more biomass than the legumes, except in 2009 where oat establishment was poor. In years with good establishment, WUE of oats (14-28 kg DM/ha.mm), snail medic (13-25 kg DM/ha.mm), and sulla (12-20 kg DM/ha.mm) were similar, but the production and WUE of vetch were generally lower (6-14 kg DM/ha.mm). Sulla dried the soil profile by 60-100 mm more than the annual species, but less than lucerne. Summer legumes, burgundy bean, and lablab performed similarly, although always produced less biomass and had lower WUE than forage sorghum. Lucerne extracted more water and maintained a drier profile by 70-150 mm and had lower WUE (<10 kg DM/ha.mm) than burgundy bean or lablab (9-30 kg DM/ha.mm). Of the legumes tested, burgundy bean and lablab seem the most likely to be profitably integrated into subtropical cropping systems. Further evidence of the rotational benefits provided by these legumes is required before they will be favoured over the perceived reliability and higher productivity of annual grass-type forages.

AB  - Many crop models have been developed for potato, and a few for sweet potato, and yam. More than 30 potato models, two sweet potato models, and three yam models are described in the literature, and each differ in model structure. Some potato models have been applied to studies of nitrogen fertilizer, irrigation management, and climate change impact, but most of these models have never been validated with field measurements. The nitrogen dynamics of potato models CROPSYSTVB-CSPOTATO, EXpert-N-SPASS, and LINTUL-NPOTATO have been tested with some field data. LPOTCO and AQUACROP are two potato models that have been tested under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions. None of the models have ever been tested with high temperature or heat stress data. The most tested and applied potato models include versions of LINTUL and SUBSTOR-Potato. Two sweet potato models, MADHURAM and SPOTCOMS, and two yam models, CROPSYSTVB-Yam and EPIC-Yam had limited field-testing under current climate conditions; however, these sweet potato and yam models are not ready for climate change impact assessments. To prepare potato, sweet potato, and yam models for climate change impact assessments, they need to be (i) calibrated with modern cultivars across agro-climatic zones; (ii) tested and improved with crop physiology and dynamic measurements of phenology, growth, partitioning, and water and nitrogen uptake under different crop management and environments; and (iii) tested and improved with field studies of crop responses to climate factors, including elevated CO2, water stress, increased temperature, heat stress, and combinations of these. Such extensive model testing and improvement with field experiments require a coordinated international effort and long-term commitment to potato, sweet potato, and yam research.

AB  - Climate-friendly best management practices for mitigating and adapting to climate change (cfBMPs) include changes in crop rotation, soil management and resource use. Determined largely by precipitation gradients, specific agroecological systems in the inland Pacific Northwestern U.S. (iPNW) feature different practices across the region. Historically, these farming systems have been economically productive, but at the cost of high soil erosion rates and organic matter depletion, making them win-lose situations. Agronomic, sociological, political and economic drivers all influence cropping system innovations. Integrated, holistic conservation systems also need to be identified to address climate change by integrating cfBMPs that provide win-win benefits for farmer and environment. We conclude that systems featuring short-term improvements in farm economics, market diversification, resource efficiency and soil health will be most readily adopted by farmers, thereby simultaneously addressing longer term challenges including climate change. Specific "win-win scenarios" are designed for different iPNW production zones delineated by water availability. The cfBMPs include reduced tillage and residue management, organic carbon (C) recycling, precision nitrogen (N) management and crop rotation diversification and intensification. Current plant breeding technologies have provided new cultivars of canola and pea that can diversify system agronomics and markets. These agronomic improvements require associated shifts in prescriptive, precision N and weed management. The integrated cfBMP systems we describe have the potential for reducing system-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by increasing soil C storage, N use efficiency (NUE) and by production of biofuels. Novel systems, even if they are economically competitive, can come with increased financial risk to producers, necessitating government support (e.g., subsidized crop insurance) to promote adoption. Other conservation-and climate change-targeted farm policies can also improve adoption. Ultimately, farmers must meet their economic and legacy goals to assure longer-term adoption of mature cfBMP for iPNW production systems.

AB  - Maintenance of available phosphorus ( P) is a problem faced by both conventional and organic systems but it is exacerbated in the latter given that manufactured inorganic sources of P fertiliser are not permitted under the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements certification guidelines. The focus of this paper is a discussion of potential agronomic strategies to assist in sustainable management of the soil P resource in organic and low-input broadacre farming systems within the Australian rain-fed cereal-livestock belt. The paper considers three broad strategies for agronomic management of Pin this context and draws on reported research from overseas and within Australia. An analysis of the current knowledge suggests that the option most likely to ensure that soluble P is not a limitation in the system is the importation of allowable inputs that contain P from off-farm, although for much of the Australian cereal-livestock belt the immediate issue may be access to economically viable sources. Research targeted at quantifying the economic and biological benefits to the whole-farm system associated with the adoption of these practices is required. Improving the P-use efficiency of the system by incorporating species into rotation or intercropping systems that are able to use P from less soluble sources has been a successful strategy in parts of the world with climate similar to much of the Australian cereal-sheep belt, and deserves further research effort in Australia. Agronomic management to maximise quantity and quality of pasture and crop plant residues undoubtedly builds labile soil organic matter and facilitates P cycling, but the strategy maybe of limited benefit in low-rainfall areas that do not have the capacity to produce large biomass inputs. Evidence that organic or low-input systems naturally increase the numbers and diversity of soil organisms is sparse and published studies from Australian systems suggest that P nutrition is not enhanced. However, seed and soil microbial inoculants to facilitate improved P uptake have been developed and are currently being field tested in Australia. Progress in selection and breeding for cereal genotypes that are more P efficient and other plant genotypes that can use less labile P sources, is gaining momentum but still remains a long-term prospect, and may involve genetic modi. cation which will not be acceptable for organic systems.
