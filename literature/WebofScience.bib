	abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) measurements are important for numerous applications including climate and weather prediction, agriculture and irrigation activities, and monitoring the progress of reclamation on land disturbed by mining or other industrial activities. We assessed the SWC measurement accuracy of a cosmic-ray soil moisture probe (CRP) and explored the possibility of downscaling the CRP measurement to the plot scale. The experiments were conducted at a highly heterogeneous reclamation site in the Alberta Oil Sands near Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada. The study site is unique because it consists of 36 one hectare plots composed of 12 different reclamation covers made up of various layering schemes of peat and coarse-textured soil. The one-hectare plots also contain different vegetation (species and density). A CRP was installed in the center of the reclamation study site and calibrated using soil core samples. CRP-measured SWC was compared to weighted average SWC measured from soil cores and a network of soil moisture probes within the CRP footprint over two summers. The CRP responded clearly to precipitation events with peaks in the measured SWC and the CRP estimates of SWC were very close to SWC estimated with soil cores and in-situ soil moisture probes with a RMSE of 0.027 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.027 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively, over the two summers. We also attempted to downscale the CRP measurements from the 2014 season to the plot scale using HYDRUS-1D modeling and the known soil texture in order to unweight the CRP-measured SWC. The modeled SWC (optimized with the CRP measurements) within the CRP footprint was relatively close to the CRP-measured SWC with a RMSE of 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3). Overall, the CRP provided accurate average SWC measurements at the reclamation site despite the soil and vegetation heterogeneity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Heat dissipation sensors operate based on the temperature dependence of the transient heat conduction within the soil, which is a function of the soil characteristics and its water content. After a heat pulse with controlled energy is applied to a heater, it is possible to show that the maximum temperature rise Delta T-M measured in the temperature sensing element can be related to the volumetric water content of the soil theta(v) [m(3) m(-3)]. The design and fabrication of a low-cost soil moisture multiprobe heat pulse sensor system using conventional printed circuit boards and surface-mount devices is presented. The proposed sensor is free of the needles' deflection problem present in conventional multiprobe sensors and is manufactured using conventional off-the-shelf electronic components. A precision low-power electronic signal conditioning circuit, using an instrumentation switched-capacitor building block, was developed and successfully used in the prototype. Due to an energy-efficient topology for the sensor and a low-power signal conditioning circuit, the average current consumption of the system (with one measurement per day) is only 3 mu A. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, a prototype of the sensor was tested in soils with volumetric humidity in the range from theta(v) = 0.05 m(3) m(-3) to theta(v) = 0.41 m(3) m(-3) and, with a very low heating energy pulse (3 J), showed a sensitivity, normalized by the total energy applied, Gamma = 211 x 10(-3) degrees C m(3) m(-3) J(-1). Compared with a button heat pulse probe sensor which has Gamma = 192 x 10(-3) degrees C m(3) m(-3) J(-1), the developed sensor shows a higher normalized sensitivity.},

This paper presents the application of this technique at four sites in southern England over almost 3years. Results show the soil moisture response to contrasting climatic conditions during 2011-2014 and are the first such field-scale measurements made in the UK. These four sites are prototype stations for a UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System, and particular consideration is given to sensor operating conditions in the UK. Comparison of these soil water content observations with the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator 10-cm soil moisture layer shows that these data can be used to test and diagnose model performance and indicate the potential for assimilation of these data into hydro-meteorological models. The application of these large-area soil water content measurements to evaluate remotely sensed soil moisture products is also demonstrated. Numerous applications and the future development of a national COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System network are discussed. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a sensor-based platform that travels through an underground pipeline system and monitors the soil water content in real time. It consists of a modified commercial soil water sensor (Diviner 2000), which is placed on two circular articulated wheeled bases, each of them driven by a small wheeled electric motor. An electronic module allows the user to control the platform by sending commands (move one step forward or backwards) from the ground station. Experiments were carried out in laboratory conditions in an artificial tank 10 m long by 0.6 m wide, and with a depth of 0.4 m (total volume 2.4 m(3)). The PVC pipelines were placed horizontally at depths of 0.1 m and 0.3 m under the soil surface. The sensor-based platform demonstrated very good mobility and produced records of the soil water content in the different horizons. The recorded values were then plotted as volumetric water content (m(3) m(-3)) versus time. The application to a border irrigation case study provided the spatial variability of the water content, so that precise information about the soil environment was gathered. Also, in a drip irrigation case study, the sensor-based platform gave important information about the technical stage of the drip irrigation system. Thus, the measurement of soil water using the proposed method is more effective than measuring the soil water status at a single point and assuming soil homogeneity. (C) 2012 IAgrE.

For Method 1, the sensor was first placed in a container and then buried. For Method 2, the entire sensor (including prongs and circuitry) was inserted into a prepacked soil sample. For Method 3, the sensor prongs were installed directly into a prepacked soil sample, and then soil was placed around the circuitry. The sensor outputs of Method 1 were significantly smaller for the volumetric soil water content () of most of the soil types compared with the sensor outputs of the other two methods. Large differences in sensor outputs were observed in relation to the installation method, which resulted in a large estimation error when using a soil moisture sensor. For example, the difference in values calculated by the calibration equation obtained by Methods 1 and 2 was 0.076 m(3) m(-3), a maximum for the Andisol sample. We observed a significant linear relation between the maximum differences in (which might result from the different sensor installation methods) and the coarse pore volume determined from soil water characteristic curves. Compaction around the sensor induced by sensor installation, which might be considerable for soil with many coarse pores, was considered the main reason for an increase in the soil moisture sensor's output value. For the sensor installed by Methods 2 or 3, a second-order polynomial equation could be used to translate sensor output to accurately except for soils with {\textgreater} 40\% clay content or very low bulk density. Highlights An appropriate calibration equation is important to monitor soil water content precisely. Effects of different sensor installation methods on calibration equations have not been determined. Method of installation considerably affected output values of a capacitance sensor. Soil compaction by sensor installation increases the sensor output: more so in coarse pore soil.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture variation with respect to depth directly affects the engineering properties of soil and the health state of plants. At the present, there are few techniques that can satisfactorily quantify the vertical moisture profile within the soil medium. In this paper, a fiber optic sensor-based distributed temperature sensing (DTS) technique is introduced for soil moisture profile mapping. In this technique, a carbon fiber heated sensing-tube (CFHST) is integrated into conventional fiber optic sensing cable to improve the sensitivity, accuracy and spatial resolution of the measurement of soil moisture profile. The CFHST consists of three parts: the inner tubing, the carbon fiber heated cable (CFHC) tightly wrapped on inner tubing, and the interface screws installed on both ends of the inner tubing. The length of a unit CFHST is adjustable according to the actual demand of a specified application. The power supply model and installation method in field are introduced. Laboratory tests were conducted to establish the relationship between soil moisture and thermal response of CFHST. A foundation pit dewatering test was also carried out to validate the field performance of this monitoring technique. The test results show that the borehole-embedded sensor monitored and recorded the continuous change of soil moisture profile accurately (RMSE = 0.046 m(3)/m(3)). This technique can effectively capture the distribution profile of soil moisture along the depth direction, which provides a new approach to investigate the physical and hydrological properties of soils.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this research was to use empirical models to monitor temporal dynamics of soil moisture in a peatland using remotely sensed imagery, and to determine the predictive accuracy of the approach on dates outside the time series through statistically independent validation. A time series of seven Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images were collected along with concurrent field measurements of soil moisture over one growing season, and soil moisture retrieval was tested using Linear Mixed Effects models (LMEs). A single-date airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) survey was incorporated into the analysis, along with temporally varying environmental covariates (Drought Code, Time Since Last Rain, Day of Year). LMEs allowed repeated measures to be accounted for at individual sampling sites, as well as soil moisture differences associated with peatland classes. Covariates provided a large amount of explanatory power in models; however, SAR imagery contributed to only a moderate improvement in soil moisture predictions (marginal R-2 = 0.07; conditional R-2 = 0.7, independently validated R-2 = 0.36). The use of LMEs allows for a more accurate characterization of soil moisture as a function of specific measurement sites, peatland classes and measurement dates on model strength and predictive power. For intensively monitored peatlands, SAR data is best analyzed in conjunction with peatland Class (e.g., derived from an ecosystem classification map) to estimate the spatial distribution of surface soil moisture, provided there is a ground-based monitoring network with a sufficiently fine spatial and temporal resolution to fit the LME models.},

The results of the microwave experiments are in a good agreement with the developed theoretical models that take into account the effects of the random surface roughness.

The estimation of soil moisture and vegetation in the land field is attracting widespread interest in hydrology, climatology and carbon cycles. In order to investigate the scattering polarization properties from different types of surface environments, an airborne measurement was performed, equipped with a new 4-channel prototype for collecting the direct, reflected left-hand circular polarization (LHCP) and right-hand circular polarization (RHCP) signals. Both the reflected LHCP and RHCP signals were acquired at the same time by a dual polarization antenna. A data averaging procedure was used to reduce the incoherent part of the received power and two reflected signals were normalized by direct signals obtained from each front-end (FE). Then three polarimetric observables were used to analyze vegetation biomass and soil moisture fluctuations. It was concluded that the polarimetric ratio (PR) is sensitive to soil moisture content (SMC) and considerably independent of roughness and vegetation biomass. The trunk component is confirmed to be the most important factor affecting the amplitude of scattering polarizations. Furthermore, the measurement results showed that the PR variation between different elevation angles was affected by roughness and biomass. The PR variation in forests with big biomass shows the least amount of changes when compared to other geographical environments. The results show another possibility of further geophysical parameter evaluations employing polarimetric applications in GNSS-R. (C) 2016 COSPAR. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The WSN consists of soil moisture sensors, weather sensors, wireless data loggers, and a wireless modem. Soil moisture sensors were installed at three depths below the ground surface in various locations across the fields. Weather sensors were mounted on a 3-m instrument tower. An antenna mount was designed and fabricated for use in the WSN. When field equipment such as a fertilizer or chemical applicator impacted the mount, the mount was capable of protecting the antenna from damage by the equipment. In the WSN, received radio signal strength of Em50R data logger decreased as the distance from the data logger to the receiver increased. It also decreased as the distance between the top of the plant canopy and the logger's antenna above the plant canopy decreased. The antenna of the Em50R logger required replacement above the plant canopy for effective data communication. The Em50G data logger was capable of transferring data as its antenna was inside the plant canopy. Using the WSN system, soil moisture and weather conditions including precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed, and humidity were measured every minute and the hourly averages were reported and stored at 1-h interval. The soil moisture data and weather data were automatically and wirelessly transmitted to the internet making the data available online.

We show that the soil moisture data possesses some unique features that can be used together with the commonly used Gaussian assumption to construct more scalable, robust, and better performing placement algorithms. Specifically, there exists a coarse-grained monotonic ordering of locations in their soil moisture level over time, both in terms of its first and second moments, a feature much more stable than the soil moisture process itself at these locations. This motivates a clustered sensor placement scheme, where locations are classified into clusters based on the ordering of the mean, with the number of sensors placed in each cluster determined by the ordering of the variances. We show that under idealized conditions the greedy mutual information maximization algorithm applied globally is equivalent to that applied cluster by cluster, but the latter has the advantage of being more scalable. Extensive numerical experiments are performed on a set of three-dimensional soil moisture data generated by a state-of-the-art soil moisture simulator. Our results show that our clustering approach outperforms applying the same algorithms globally, and is very robust to lack of training and errors in training data.},

Use of LFM proxies could reduce the need for field sampling while potentially improving spatial and temporal sampling density. This study compares soil moisture and remote sensing data to field-sampled LFM for Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii Nutt) and big sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata Nutt) in northern Utah. Bivariate linear regression models were constructed between LFM and four independent variables. Soil moisture was more strongly correlated with LFM than remote sensing measurements, and produced the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) in predicted LFM values at most of the sites. When sites were pooled, canopy water content (CWC) had stronger correlations with LFM than normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or normalized difference water index (NDWI). MAE values for all proxies were frequently above 20 \% LFM at individual sites. Despite this relatively large error, remote sensing and soil moisture data may still be useful for improving understanding of spatial and temporal trends in LFM.},

	abstract = {The availability of high sensitivity temperature sensors (0.001 K sensitivity platinum resistors), which can be positioned at intervals of a few centimeters along a vertical profile in the unsaturated zone, allows short-term in situ determinations-one day or even less-of the thermal diffusivity. The development of high data storage capabilities also makes this possible over long periods and the relative variations in thermal diffusivity allow the monitoring of the variations in water content. The processing of temperature measurements recorded at different depths is achieved by solving the heat equation, using the finite elements method, with both conductive and convective heat transfers. A first set of measurements has allowed this approach to be validated. Water content variations derived from thermal diffusivity values are in excellent agreement with TDR measurements carried out on the experimental site at Boissy-le-Chatel (Seine et Marne, France).},

	abstract = {The dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method is attractive for measuring soil thermal properties and volumetric water content. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a DPHP sensor having rigid probes made from thick-walled stainless steel tubing (2.38-mm outside diameter). The probes of this sensor are much more resistant to deflection than those of conventional DPHP sensors, decreasing measurement error caused by probe deflection during insertion into the soil. Laboratory experiments were conducted across a wide range of saturation levels with glass beads and three soils of different textures. For inferring soil properties from the proposed sensor, we applied the recently developed identical cylindrical perfect conductors (ICPC) model instead of the infinite line source (ILS) model that is typically used. The ICPC model improves solution for heat transport through the probe-soil system by accounting for the heat capacity and radius of the probes. Our results show a root mean square error of 1.4\% volumetric water content and elimination of the measurement bias typically encountered with DPHP measurements. We conclude that the improved sensor, in combination with the ICPC model, provides a general, soil-independent water content estimate that is especially suitable for field soil water content monitoring because of its robust design with rigid probes. Because of its simplicity and measurements independent of soil type, we propose the presented DPHP method as an excellent alternative to other available measurement techniques for soil water content.},

	abstract = {The field deployment of a heated distributed temperature sensor (DTS) for over three years has revealed two obstacles to estimating soil moisture () that may hamper subsurface DTS applications as well as use of other subsurface thermal probes. The first observed obstacle was a hysteretic response of the DTS sensor. The relationship between and the temperature response (T) within the cable was not only dependent on of the soil, but also on the previous wetting and drying cycles leading to that state. The second observed obstacle was soil structure healing. Soil structure healing causes the relationship between T and to evolve through time; this calibration curve becomes flatter, or less sensitive, as the surrounding soil makes better contact with the cable. Effects of the hysteretic response of the instrument and soil structure healing are largely the result of small gaps between the cable and soil. These small gaps can be approximated by a contact resistance between the cable and soil. In this article we characterize the occurrence of hysteretic and soil structure healing effects from field data and parameterize contact resistance by simulating heat transfer using a numerical modelling approach Copyright (c) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Current methods to assess soil moisture extremes rely primarily on point-based in situ meteorological stations which typically provide precipitation and temperature rather than direct measurements of soil moisture. Microwave remote sensing offers the possibility of quantifying surface soil moisture conditions over large spatial extents. Capturing soil moisture anomalies normally requires a long temporal record of data, which most operating satellites do not have. This research examines the use of surface soil moisture from the AMSR-E passive microwave satellite to derive surface soil moisture anomalies by exploiting spatial resolution to compensate for the shorter temporal record of the satellite sensor. Four methods were used to spatially aggregate information to develop a surface soil moisture anomaly (SMA). Two of these methods used soil survey and climatological zones to define regions of homogeneity, based on the Soil Landscapes of Canada (SLC) and the EcoDistrict nested hierarchy. The second two methods (ObShp3 and ObShp5) used zones defined by a data driven segmentation of the satellite soil moisture data. The level of sensitivity of the calculated SMA decreased as the number of pixels used in the spatial aggregation increased, with the average error reducing to less than 5\% when more than 15 pixels are used. All methods of spatial aggregation showed somewhat weak but consistent relationship to in situ soil moisture anomalies and meteorological drought indices. The size of the regions used for aggregation was more important than the method used to create the regions. Based on the error and the relationship to the in situ and ancillary data sets, the EcoDistrict or ObShp3 scale appears to provide the lowest error in calculating the SMA baseline. This research demonstrates that the use of spatial aggregation can provide useful information on soil moisture anomalies where satellite records of data are temporally short.

Soil cores taken at the conclusion of the 1-year study indicated evidence of nitrate and phosphorus leaching. Available nitrates in the top 100 cm of soil showed a decreasing trend but were higher than all other parallel controls. Soil crop-available phosphorous in the soil increased below the drip line, as result that may be ascribed to soil cracking that was not properly controlled at the test site.

	abstract = {We consider the problem of monitoring soil moisture evolution using a wireless network of in-situ underground sensors. To reduce cost and prolong lifetime, it is highly desirable to rely on fewer measurements and estimate with higher accuracy the original signal (the temporal evolution of soil moisture). In this article, we explore the use of results from the theory of sparse sampling, including Compressive Sensing (CS) and Matrix Completion (MC), in this application context. We first consider the problem of reconstructing the soil moisture process at a single location using CS. Our physical constraint leads to very sparse measurement matrices, which makes finding a suitable representation basis very challenging: it needs to make the underlying signal sufficiently sparse while at the same time being sufficiently incoherent with the measurement matrix, two common preconditions for CS techniques to work well. We construct a representation basis by exploiting unique features of soil moisture evolution and show that this basis attains a very good tradeoff between its ability to sparsify the signal and its incoherence with measurement matrices that are consistent with our physical constraints. We next consider the problem of jointly reconstructing soil moisture processes at multiple locations, assuming sparse measurements can be taken at each location. We show that the spatial soil moisture process enjoys a low-rank property, a priority for MC. Accordingly, we introduce a spatiotemporal measurement matrix and apply the MC framework to reconstruct the soil moisture field. Extensive numerical evaluation is performed on both real, high-resolution soil moisture data and simulated data and through comparison with a closed-loop scheduling approach. Our results demonstrate that, for a single location, a uniform measurement scheduling followed by CS recovery results in a very nice tradeoff between estimation accuracy, sampling rate, flexibility, and feasibility in implementation. When multiple locations are available, our results show that joint reconstruction using MC in general produces better estimation accuracy than using a single location alone, but it requires the use of independent and random measurement schedules across locations. We also show that these sparse sampling techniques can be augmented so as to be robust against sporadic data outliers/corruption caused by, for example, intermittent sensor faults.},

Continuously sampling moisture levels with these sensors incurs high-maintenance and energy consumption costs, which are particularly undesirable for wireless networks. Our main hypothesis is that a sparser set of measurements can meet the monitoring objectives in an energy-efficient manner. The underlying idea is that we can trade off some inaccuracy in estimating soil moisture evolution for a significant reduction in energy consumption. We investigate how to dynamically schedule the sensor measurements so as to balance this tradeoff. Unlike many prior studies on sensor scheduling that make generic assumptions on the statistics of the observed phenomenon, we obtain statistics of soil moisture evolution from a physical model. We formulate the optimal measurement scheduling and estimation problem as a partially observable Markov decision problem (POMDP). We then utilize special features of the problem to approximate the POMDP by a computationally simpler finite-state Markov decision problem (MDP). The result is a scalable, implementable technology that we have tested and validated numerically and in the field.},

While several controlled experiments have been conducted to study the effects of water content variations on the antenna-material coupling, they considered a limited range of moisture variations and soil textures. Furthermore, those previous experiments did not consider highly dynamic shallow moisture responses that would be encountered under natural field conditions. For these reasons, general acceptance of this method requires that it be tested in real-life applications. Our paper evaluates the early-time GPR technique under natural field conditions where surface roughness, lithology, lateral heterogeneities, vegetation and water content dynamics are not controlled. We assess the capacity of the early-time amplitude technique over the complete annual cycle of soil moisture conditions at three textural sites. To evaluate the sensitivity of the early-time amplitudes to subsurface water content variations, we compare the early-time results acquired using the enveloped amplitude of the first part of GPR signals with the bulk dielectric permittivity obtained from concurrently collected common-midpoint direct ground wave velocity and gravimetric water content measurements. Our results demonstrate that the early-time method can yield near-surface permittivity information that is consistent with that obtained from direct ground wave velocity measurements, and accurate predictions of shallow soil moisture conditions.},

It was discovered that changes in f(d) were highly correlated with changes in theta, and a third-order polynomial equation (R-2 = 0.96) was developed describing the relationship. The effectiveness of f(d) for theta measurement was evaluated for three soils and a sand across a range of theta. The effects of soil temperature and soil salinity were also evaluated. Accurate measurements of theta were obtained even in dry soil and sand. The root mean square error of the theta estimated by the f(d) measurement was 0.021.

The sensor adopted techniques from the ultra-wideband radar to enable measurements of ground reflection at resolutions that are smaller than the antenna beamwidth of the sensor. An experimental prototype was developed for field measurements. Extensive field measurements using the developed prototype were conducted on grass pasture at different ground conditions to validate the accuracy of the sensor in performing soil moisture measurements.},

	abstract = {Drought is a complex natural disaster that occurs frequently. Soil moisture has been the main issue in remote monitoring of drought events as the most direct and important variable describing the drought. Spatio-temporal distribution and variation of soil moisture evidently affect surface evapotranspiration, agricultural water demand, etc. In this paper, a new simple method for soil moisture monitoring is developed using near-infrared versus red (NIR-red) spectral reflectance space. First, NIR-red spectral reflectance space is established using atmospheric and geometric corrected ETM+ data, which is manifested by a triangle shape, in which different surface covers have similar spatial distribution rules. Next, the model of soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing (SMMRS) is developed on the basis of the distribution characteristics of soil moisture in the NIR-red spectral reflectance space. Then, the SMMRS model is validated by comparison with field measured soil moisture data at different depths. The results showed that satellite estimated soil moisture by SMMRS is highly accordant with field measured data at 5 cm soil depth and average soil moisture at 0-20 cm soil depths, correlation coefficients are 0.80 and 0.87, respectively. This paper concludes that, being simple and effective, the SMMRS model has great potential to estimate surface moisture conditions.},

The use of drought-tolerant plants such as Sedum species, reduces the water requirements in the dry season, but, even so, in semiarid environments these can reach up to 60 L m(-2) per day. Continuous substrate/soil water content monitoring would facilitate the efficient use of this critical resource. In this context, the use of plant microbial fuel cells (PMFCs) emerges as a suitable and more sustainable alternative for monitoring water content in green roofs in semiarid climates. In this study, bench and pilot-scale experiments using seven Sedum species showed a positive relationship between current generation and water content in the substrate. PMFC reactors with higher water content (around 27\% vs. 17.5\% v/v) showed larger power density (114.6 and 82.3 mu W m(-2) vs. 32.5 mu W m(-2)). Moreover, a correlation coefficient of 0.95 (+/- 0.01) between current density and water content was observed.

To address this need, this paper evaluates an LDAS for agricultural drought monitoring by benchmarking individual components of the system (i.e., a satellite soil moisture retrieval algorithm, a soil water balance model, and a sequential data assimilation filter) against a series of linear models that perform the same function (i.e., have the same basic input/output structure) as the full system component. Benchmarking is based on the calculation of the lagged rank cross correlation between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and soil moisture estimates acquired for various components of the system. Lagged soil moisture/NDVI correlations obtained using individual LDAS components versus their linear analogs reveal the degree to which nonlinearities and/or complexities contained within each component actually contribute to the performance of the LDAS system as a whole. Here, a particular system based on surface soil moisture retrievals from the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), a two-layer Palmer soil water balance model, and an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) is benchmarked. Results suggest significant room for improvement in each component of the system.},

Water and Energy Balance (WEB) SVAT modeling is based on forcing a prognostic root-zone water balance model with observed rainfall and predicted evapotranspiration. In contrast, thermal Remote Sensing (RS) observations of surface radiometric temperature (T-R) are integrated into purely diagnostic RS-SVAT models to predict the onset of vegetation water stress. While RS-SVAT models do not explicitly monitor soil moisture, they can be used in the calculation of thermal-based proxy variables for the availability of soil water in the root zone. Using four growing seasons (2001 to 2004) of profile soil moisture, micro-meteorology, and surface radiometric temperature measurements at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Optimizing Production Inputs for Economic and Environmental Enhancements (OPE3) study site in Beltsville, MD, prospects for improving WEB-SVAT root-zone soil water predictions via the assimilation of diagnostic RS-SVAT soil moisture proxy information are examined. Results illustrate the potential advantages of such an assimilation approach relative to the competing approach of directly assimilating T-R measurements. Since T-R measurements used in the analysis are tower-based (and not obtained from a remote platform), a sensitivity analysis demonstrates the potential impact of remote sensing limitations on the value of the RS-SVAT proxy. Overall, results support a potential role for RS-SVAT modeling strategies in improving WEB-SVAT model characterization of root-zone soil moisture. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

The objective of this research was to examine three passive microwave derived soil moisture datasets over multiple growing seasons in contrasting Canadian agricultural environments. Absolute and relative soil moisture was evaluated from two globally available datasets from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E) sensor using different retrieval algorithms, as well as relative soil wetness at a weekly scale from the Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I) sensor. At a daily scale, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) provides a better estimate of surface soil moisture conditions than the National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) dataset, with root mean squared errors ranging from 5 to 10\% for LPRM and 12 to 18\% for NSIDC soil moisture when a temporal smoothing is applied to the dataset. Both datasets provided better estimates of soil moisture over the temperate site near Elora, Ontario than the prairie site near Davidson, Saskatchewan. The LPRM dataset tends to overestimate soil moisture conditions at both sites, where the NSIDC dataset tends to underestimate absolute soil moisture. These differences in retrieval methods were independent of radiometric frequency used. At weekly scales, the LPRM dataset provides a better relative estimate of wetness conditions when compared to the NSIDC and the Basist Wetness Index (BWI) from SSM/I data, but the SSM/I dataset did provide a reasonably good relative indicator of moisture conditions. The high variability in accuracy of soil moisture estimation related to retrieval algorithms indicates that consistency is needed in these datasets if they are to be integrated in long term studies for yield estimation or data assimilation.},

	abstract = {With the increasing attention to site-specific or variable rate irrigation management, it is helpful to reconsider the quantity and placement of soil water monitoring locations in this context. Volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) was monitored using a neutron probe (NP) at 72 locations in a center pivot irrigated field in eastern Nebraska. Variance reduction and temporal stability analyses were performed on theta(v) from shallow (similar to top 46 cm) and full profile (similar to 122 cm) readings for four monitoring cycles in the 2015 growing season and 2016 preseason. Eleven additional cycles were included for a subset of the data for the temporal stability analysis. The spatial correlation scale for theta(v) was found to be less than the closest spacing of monitoring locations in the study (i.e. {\textless}37 m). For this field site, approximately three neutron probe monitoring locations were required to determine mean soil water depletion (+/- 2 cm) for the field or for a management zone. Little economy would be gained in variance reduction for areal mean theta(v) from using a stratified network for management areas of reasonable size in a center pivot irrigated field. Temporally stable monitoring locations were identified. However, relatively low-cost spatial predictor variables, including elevation, deviation from mean elevation, apparent electrical conductivity, and mean relative difference of interpolated cosmic ray neutron probe surveys, were not consistent predictors of NP mean relative difference. The small range of variability of theta(v) within the study field is thought to be a contributing factor. It is possible that for fields with similar variability, or for site-specific irrigation where zones have been selected to reduce within-zone variance, that sensor quantity is more important than sensor placement in quantifying the areal mean theta(v) for irrigation management.

Determination of the surface water demands for irrigation purposes comes out from the assumption of hydrologic processes stationarity. This paper shows our research prerequisite that water stress participates in an important part on the volume changes of over ground parts, which is predictive for the irrigation demand. Malus domestica var. Yellow Transparent was chosen for the measurement of volume changes of the surface plant parts.

We compared the dendrometric changes to soil moisture and rainfall on both irrigated and non-irrigated trees. The experiment showed the differences between the irrigated apple tree (the diameters of the branches fluctuated between 11.9 and 12.1 mm) and the non-irrigated apple tree (the diameter of the branches increased after three-day rain from 8.35 to 8.61 mm), in order to determine the water stress of plants based on dendrometric changes and optimize irrigation during the drought period.},

Unlike other measurement principles, a new measurable index, eta, which was independent of the output impedance and the amplitude of the oscillator while relying on the electrical impedance of a multi-pin probe, was proposed. Moreover, a model for processing the impedance of the multi-pin soil probe was developed, and several important electrical parameters for establishing their operating ranges applicable to this probe were evaluated. In order to confirm the theoretical analysis, an experiment was conducted with a 4-pin probe. Using the developed model, the relationship between the proposed index eta and soil volumetric water content was shown to be linear (R-2 = 0.9921). Thus, as the measurable index, eta seemed satisfactory.},

This combination allowed the determination of W at the three depth ranges: 0-5, 0-30, and 5-30 cm. This considerably specified the vertical distribution of W. Both instruments were developed as an integrated remote-sensing system that was installed onboard a light aircraft and tested on an irrigated agricultural region of the Negev desert, Israel. For processing and analysing the results, analytical models for both reflection coefficient () and intensity of the natural gamma radiation () were developed for various types of soils and vertical distributions of W. Using these models, the problem of the inverse retrieval of W was solved, and the depth of sampling z was evaluated. SC allowed the measurement of average W for the depth of 0.5-5.0 cm depending on W and dW/dz at the soil surface. For GR, the sampling depth varied from 20 to 30 cm depending on the mean value of W in the top soil layer. Field experiments showed that W retrieved by the developed system was in good agreement (r(2) 0.9) with ground measurements, thus indicating sufficient accuracy of both instruments.},

Supply voltage of 3.3V is given to the heater-coil having resistance of 33 Omega power consumption of 330 mW, which is among the lowest in this category of sensors. The heater probe is 40 mm long with 2 mm diameter and hence is stiff enough to be inserted into the soil. The parametric finite element simulation study was performed to ensure that the maximum temperature rise is between 1 degrees C and 5 degrees C for wet and dry soils, respectively. The discrepancy between the simulation and experiment is less than 3.2\%. The sensor was validated with white clay and tested with red soil samples to detect volumetric water-content ranging from 0\% to 30\%. The sensor element is integrated with low-power electronics for amplifying the output from thermocouple sensor and TelosB mote for wireless communication. A 3.7V lithium ion battery with capacity of 1150 mAh is used to power the system. The battery is charged by a 6V and 300 mA solar cell array. Readings were taken in 30 min intervals. The life-time of DPHP sensor node is around 3.6 days.

	abstract = {The recent transformation of wetlands into farmland in East Africa is accelerating due to growing food-demand, land shortages, and an increasing unpredictability of climatic conditions for crop production in uplands. However, the conversion of pristine wetlands into sites of production may alter hydrological attributes with negative effects on production potential. Particularly the amount and the dynamics of plant available soil moisture in the rooting zone of crops determine to a large extent the agricultural production potential of wetlands. Various methods exist to assess soil moisture dynamics with Frequency Domain Reflectometry (FDR) being among the most prominent. However, the suitability of FOR sensors for assessing plant available soil moisture has to date not been confirmed for wetland soils in the region. We monitored the seasonal and spatial dynamics of water availability for crop growth in an inland valley wetland of the Kenyan highlands using a FOR sensor which was site-specifically calibrated. Access tubes were installed within different wetland use types and hydrological situations along valley transects and soil properties affecting soil moisture (organic C, texture, and bulk density) were investigated. There was little variation in soil attributes between physical positions in the valley, and also between topsoil and subsoil attributes with the exception of organic C contents. With a root mean squared error of 0.073 m(3)/m(3), the developed calibration function of the FDR sensor allows for reasonably accurate soil moisture prediction for both within-site comparisons and the monitoring of temporal soil moisture variations. Applying the calibration equation to a time series of profile probe readings over a period of one year illustrated not only the temporal variation of soil moisture, but also effects of land use.

In order to design a soil moisture network for this task in the Great Lakes Basin (522 000 km(2)), the dual-entropy multiobjective optimization algorithm was used to maximize the information content and minimize the redundancy of information in a potential soil moisture monitoring network. Soil moisture retrieved from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission during the frost-free periods of 2010-2013 were filtered for data quality and then used in a multiobjective search to find Pareto optimum network designs based on the joint entropy and total correlation measures of information content and information redundancy, respectively. Differences in the information content of SMOS ascending and descending overpasses resulted in distinctly different network designs. Entropy from the SMOS ascending overpass was found to be spatially consistent, whereas descending overpass entropy had many peaks that coincided with areas of high subgrid heterogeneity. A combination of both ascending and descending overpasses produced network designs that incorporated aspects of information from each overpass. Initial networks were designed to include 15 monitoring sites, but the addition of network cost as an objective demonstrated that a network with similar information content could be achieved with fewer monitoring stations.},

In order to optimize the design with respect to sampling volume and losses, we derived the electromagnetic fields produced by a TDR sensor with this geometry. Using this analytical derivation, the effects on sampling area, waveform shape, and losses while varying design and soil water content were examined. It was found that when the soil and tube substrate have identical dielectrics, then sampling area has a local extremum. Tube radius has the largest impact of any geometrical parameter on sampling area with increases in radius causing increases in sampling area. Increasing electrode separation angle increases the sampling area slightly. The effects on TDR waveform are greatest for soil water content, tube dielectric, and tube radius: where increasing any of these increase delay and dispersion.},

Sensors with greater separation between electrodes, achieved by means different tube diameters or the separation angles, tend to have greater field penetration in both sand and clay. In addition, sensors with the shortest electrode separation show greater sensitivity to soil electrical conductivity. Together, these trends demonstrate that the propagating electromagnetic fields above 0 Hz do not take the transverse electromagnetic form commonly assumed in the analysis of TDR probes.},

	abstract = {Precision agriculture is drawing widespread attention and increasing interest in the use of on-the-go sensors to extract soil and plant information. This new trend is evident from an increased number of (tillage) studies concerning the development of sensors for measuring physical soil properties. In this study, a new dielectric-based horizontal sensor was designed and stationary calibrated in pots for measurement of volumetric soil water content. Subsequently, the sensor was combined with a load cell and installed on a tine with thickness of 25 mm, and its dynamic performance was assessed. The load cell behind the tine measures horizontal soil mechanical resistance. In order to evaluate the on-the-go performance of this combined sensor, two experiments were carried out in a soil bin, with the purpose of (i) measuring soil water content along a transect of longitudinally variable water contents, (ii) investigating the difference in horizontal resistance force measured by either the combined (horizontal force and water content) or a single sensor (horizontal force only). The stationary calibration results showed that quadratic equations with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.989 and 0.918 could be fitted to the data points obtained from measurements in soil bulk densities of 1.5 and 1.2 g cm(-3), respectively. The results of the soil bin experiments indicated that the response of the dielectric sensor to soil water content variations was reasonable, but that the output voltage of the sensor should be amplified for a better sensitivity and resolution. The presented combined sensor can provide useful information on soil physical properties towards site specific applications in soils. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture sensors infer volumetric soil water content (SWC) from other properties of the bulk porous media. The CS655 water content reflectometer is a relatively new, low-frequency electromagnetic sensor that determines relative permittivity (K-a) using the two-way travel period and voltage attenuation of the applied signal along two 12-cm rods. This measured attenuation is quadratically related to bulk electrical conductivity (EC). Along with an onboard thermistor, the CS655 allows a more robust correction of propagation time and K-a, which its predecessors, the CS615 and CS616, lacked. However, with new sensors it is necessary to quantify their practical accuracy in the field. Here, we present an overview of the CS655 sensor and an evaluation under both laboratory and field conditions, using five surface soils (0-10-cm depth) in the laboratory and gravimetric samples collected in the field. Overall, a site-specific calibration using a two-term linearization of the SWC-K-a function reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of the factory-derived SWC of 0.073 and 0.043 m(3) m(-3) during batch and infiltration experiments, respectively, to 0.025 and 0.028 m(3) m(-3). Results further indicate that a soil-specific calibration additionally reduced the RMSE to {\textless}0.02 m(3) m(-3). Field evaluation across the Texas Soil Observation Network found that calibration reduced the variance across the network but did not affect the arithmetic mean or the RMSE against gravimetric sampling, which remained similar to 0.05 m(3) m(-3) regardless of the SWC-K-a-EC function applied. At the regional scale, a global calibration is sufficient.},

Despite the importance of SWC, it is not yet measured in an operational way at larger scales. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of wireless sensor network technology for the near-real-time monitoring of SWC at the field and headwater catchment scales using the recently developed wireless sensor network SoilNet. The forest catchment Wustebach (similar to 27 ha) was instrumented with 150 end devices and 600 EC-5 SWC sensors from the ECH2O series by Decagon Devices. In the period between August and November 2009, more than six million SWC measurements were obtained. The observed spatial variability corresponded well with results from previous studies. The very low scattering in the plots of mean SWC against SWC variance indicates that the sensor network data provide a more accurate estimate of SWC variance than discontinuous data from measurement campaigns, due, e. g., to fixed sampling locations and permanently installed sensors. The spatial variability in SWC at the 50-cm depth was significantly lower than at 5 cm, indicating that the longer travel time to this depth reduced the spatial variability of SWC. Topographic features showed the strongest correlation with SWC during dry periods, indicating that the control of topography on the SWC pattern depended on the soil water status. Interpolation results indicated that the high sampling density allowed capture of the key patterns of SWC variation.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture measurements are essential to understand land surface-atmosphere interactions. In this paper we evaluate the performance of the low-cost 10HS capacitance sensor (Decagon Devices, United States) using laboratory and field measurements. Measurements with 10HS sensors of volumetric water content (VWC, Vol.\%), integrated absolute soil moisture (millimeters) over the measured soil column, and the loss of soil moisture (millimeters) for rainless days are compared with corresponding measurements from gravimetric samples and time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors. The field measurements were performed at two sites with different soil texture in Switzerland, and they cover more than a year of parallel measurements in several depths down to 120 cm. For low VWC, both sensor types present good agreement for laboratory and field measurements. Nevertheless, the measurement accuracy of the 10HS sensor reading (millivolts) considerably decreases with increasing VWC: the 10HS sensors tend to become insensitive to variations of VWC above 40 Vol.\%. The field measurements reveal a soil type dependency of the 10HS sensor performance, and thus limited applicability of laboratory calibrations. However, with site-specific exponential calibration functions derived from parallel 10HS and TDR measurements, the error of the 10HS compared to the TDR measurements can be decreased for soil moisture contents up to 30 Vol.\%, and the day-to-day variability of soil moisture is captured. We conclude that the 10HS sensor is appropriate for setting up dense soil moisture networks when focusing on medium to low VWC and using an established site-specific calibration function. This measurement range is appropriate for several applications in climate research, but the identified performance limitations should be considered in investigations focusing on humid conditions and absolute soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Drought is a complex phenomenon that varies in intensity over space and time. Due to the spatial and temporal variabilities of drought, better tools are required to assess its severity and spatial extent at any point. Because agricultural drought is influenced by several factors such as rainfall, soil characteristics, and crop type, we propose an analysis method using the soil moisture index to assess drought conditions. Effective drought management can be achieved using drought monitoring if the current conditions can be assessed and future drought development predicted, and decision-makers have required drought response operations that should be available and accessible for use in a short period of time and need to be updated on the latest drought situation. In this study, we developed a web-based geographic information system technology that can broadcast drought conditions in real-time over the Internet and can assist drought management to improve the quality of their decision-making and increase efficiency and effectiveness due to the demand for interaction between decision-makers in the drought management, particularly during drought response. The primary objective of a real-time online drought broadcast system is to provide real-time drought data accessibility and analysis by permitting access to drought's intensity, duration, patterns, and clearly illustrating the spatial extent of drought through the Web, and to contribute to better policy and decision making for drought management. Users can access the www graphical user interface and be able to readily access for current drought condition, respond to drought events more effectively, and provide comparisons of the current drought event to past events. In addition, users can obtain a daily soil moisture index map and evaluate the severity of the agricultural drought based on soil moisture changes. Our system can be used by decision-makers to assess current drought conditions, thereby allowing for informed drought management decisions.

The main purpose of this study was to evaluate its performance under real field conditions. The evaluation was performed on four sites in Tunisia and France where several measuring campaigns were organized between 2000 and 2002. Reference SWC measurements also taken systematically. Direct comparisons of the corresponding data showed that a linear correction was generally sufficient to locally calibrate the TRIME (time domain reflectometry with intelligent microelements) measurements. Nevertheless, because of the influence of other interfering factors, a significant error (0.01 {\textless} RMSE {\textless} 0.07) still remained after this correction. As a possible alternative, the internal standard TRIME-FM3 calibration was also examined. On the basis of our large set of data, new calibration coefficients were to convert the TRIME-FM3 internal measurement (a so-called pseudo transit time) into the displayed SWC. However, its general validity should be tested with other independent data. Several laboratory experiments were also performed: TRIME-tube measurements were taken on reference media and on a 10-L sample of soil that was monitored twice during drying from total water saturation to an equilibrium dry state. It was thus possible to quantify the sensitivity of the TRIME-tube measurement to the surrounding medium permittivity. An empirical formula was also established for inferring the soil permittivity from the TRIME tube measured pseudo transit time.},

This conflict is one of the core issues of automatic water-saving irrigation technology in agriculture. At the same time, capacitive soil moisture sensor (CSMS) has received considerable attention, for it can acquire Nwith low cost and high precision, and meet the application requirements of wireless sensor network (WSN). But CSMS is vulnerable to the soil temperature (TO and salinity (S-s) in the measurement process. Therefore, this study took EC-5 sensor for example to establish water detection calibration models of soil temperature and salinity for single sensor, using Least Squares Support Vector Machines on MatLAB(LS-SVMlab) as the tool. On this basis, we explored the spatial variability of T-s and S-s, and then a method, which could be used to calibrate the output signals of sensors in multi-point network, was proposed based on the information-sharing (T-s or S-s) technology of WSN. Through laboratory experiment, we effectively reduced the impact of soil temperature and salinity on the single sensor. In example analysis, we investigated the detection precision and costs under different information-sharing radiuses (r). And the results indicated that the method we proposed based on the information-sharing technology of WSN could successfully calibrate the influence of soil temperature and salinity on sensors in multi-point network, and it was an efficacious approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. For example, while the calibration precision of soil temperature and salinity is respectively 1\%, the costs can be reduced by 30\%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Influenced by constraints like precipitation and vegetation cover, this complex parameter is often measured point-by-point. Continuous soil moisture products derived from remote sensing are currently available only at coarse spatial resolutions. In this context, plants are of special interest, as their growth and distribution is determined by soil properties. Plant characteristics can be utilized as indicators or proxies of mean soil moisture. This study focuses on the derivation of top soil layer moisture content based on these indicator values by synergistically utilizing different methods and active as well as passive sensors. Subsequently, a joint model was developed to derive a high spatial resolution soil moisture product for the investigated wetlands. This model reached a coefficient of determination of 0.93. The result is valuable to many different user groups like water or nature conservation authorities of all administrative levels. The implementation is mainly based on Sentinel-1 and -2 along with Landsat data sets. The high repetition rate of the Sentinel sensors can increase the classification accuracy of the bio-indicators by a precise mapping of the phenological stages. The results indicate that the method is transferable to other riparian areas to a certain degree. In addition, a time series analysis covering a period of 16 years based on a soil moisture index derived from Landsat data sets was realized. Changes in soil moisture, following restoration measures, emerge clearly and thus allow for a remote sensing-based monitoring of restoration success.},

The immediate recharge and fast recession after a peak are the primary features of soil moisture in the upper zone. Stability and significant storage increase are distinct characteristics of soil moisture in the buffer zone and the flow path zone respectively. Spatial distribution of temporal soil moisture variations can be characterized in terms of recession, stability and recharge depending upon the topographic classification of a hillslope for this approach.

	abstract = {The volumetric soil water content (theta) is fundamental to agriculture because its spatiotemporal variation in soil affects the growth of plants. Unfortunately, the universally accepted thermogravimetric method for estimating volumetric soil water content is very labour intensive and time-consuming for use in field-scale monitoring. Electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments have proven to be useful in mapping the spatiotemporal variation of theta. However, depth-specific variation in theta, which is important for irrigation management, has been little explored. The objective of this study was to develop a relationship between theta and estimates of true electrical conductivity (sigma) and to use this relationship to develop time-lapse images of soil theta beneath a centre-pivot irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop in San Jacinto, California, USA. We first measured the bulk apparent electrical conductivity (ECa - mS/m) using a DUALEM-421 over a period of 12 days after an irrigation event (i.e. days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12). We used EM4Soil to generate EM conductivity images (EMCIs). We used a physical model to estimate theta from sigma, accounting for soil tortuosity and pore water salinity, with a cross-validation RMSE of 0.04 cm(3)/cm(3). Testing the scenario where no soil information is available, we used a three-parameter exponential model to relate theta to sigma and then to map theta along the transect on different days. The results allowed us to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of theta across the surveyed area, over the 12-day period. In this regard, we were able to map the soil close to field capacity (0.27 cm(3)/cm(3)) and approaching permanent wilting point (0.03 cm(3)/cm(3)). The time-lapse theta monitoring approach, developed using EMCI, has implications for soil and water use and management and will potentially allow farmers and consultants to identify inefficiencies in water application rates and use. It can also be used as a research tool to potentially assist precision irrigation practices and to test the efficacy of different methods of irrigation in terms of water delivery and efficiency in water use in near real time.},

In the present research, surface SM (SSM) datasets at six subregions of Iran with different climate conditions were extracted from two satellite based passive (SMOSL3) and active + passive (ESA CCI SM) microwave observations, and two reanalysis (ERA-Interim and ERA-Interim/Land) products. Time series of averaged monthly mean SSM products and in situ ground precipitation and temperature measurements were derived for each subregion. Results revealed that, generally, all SSM products were in good agreement with each other with correlation coefficients higher than 0.5. The better agreement was found in the Northeast and Southwest region with average correlation values equal to 0.88 and 0.91, respectively. It should be noted that the SSM datasets are characterized by different periods and lengths. Hence, results should be assessed with cautious. Moreover, most SSM products have strong correlations with maximum, minimum and average temperature as well as with total monthly precipitation. Also, trend analysis showed no trend for time series of monthly SSM over all subregions in the two periods 1980-1999 and 2000-2014. The only exceptions were the Southeast subregion for ERA-Interim and Center and Northwest subregions for the ESA CCI SM for which a negative trend was detected for the period 2000-2014. Finally, the Standardized Soil Moisture Index (SSI) calculated from ERA-Interim, ERA-I/Land and ESA CCI SM datasets showed that the Center and Southeast regions suffered from the most severe and longest-lasting drought events in the last decade.

Although designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing, the CYGNSS receivers also record GNSS reflections over land. The CYGNSS observations of reflection power are compared to SMAP SM between March 2017 and February 2018. A strong, positive linear relationship exists between changes in CYGNSS reflectivity and changes in SMAP SM, but not between the absolute magnitudes of the two observations. The sensitivity of CYGNSS reflectivity to SM varies spatially and can be used to convert reflectivity to estimates of SM. The unbiased root-mean-square difference between daily averaged CYGNSS-derived SM and SMAP SM is 0.045cm(3)/cm(3) and is similarly low between CYGNSS and in situ SM. These results show that CYGNSS, and future GNSS reflection missions, could provide global SM observations.},

Remote sensing, in particular, using sensors that acquire data at microwave frequencies, is being used to overcome this challenge. In situ soil moisture monitoring can be used to validate remotely sensed surface soil moisture estimates and as inputs for agronomic and hydrologic models. Nine in situ soil moisture stations were established in Manitoba (Canada) and instrumented with Stevens Hydra Probes. The sensors were installed in triplicate with vertical orientation at the surface and with horizontal orientation at the 5-, 20-, 50-, and 100-cm depths. To ensure accuracy of the measured soil moisture, both laboratory and field calibrations were conducted. These calibrated soil moisture values were compared with the probe default values and those generated using published calibrations. Overall, the results showed that the field calibration was superior (coefficient of determination r(2) of 0.95) to the laboratory calibration (r(2) of 0.89). In addition, coarse-textured sites generally performed better than the fine-textured, high cation exchange capacity (CEC) sites. At the Kelburn site with high clay and CEC, the use of field calibration reduced the root mean square error from 0.188 to 0.026 m(3) m(-3). However, at the low clay and CEC Treherne site, gains in accuracy were minimal, about 0.005 m(3) m(-3). The laboratory calibration consistently underestimated soil moisture at all the evaluation sites, whereas both Topp and Logsdon calibrations overestimated soil moisture.},

However, the relationships between microclimate variation, plant water usage, and growth are not well understood. A series of trials were conducted to investigate the microclimate variations in different greenhouses and whether a soil moisture sensor-based system can be used in monitoring and controlling irrigation in greenhouse crop productions. Ocimum basilicum `Genovese Gigante' basil and Campanula portenschlagiana `Get Mee' bellflowers were monitored using soil moisture sensors for an entire crop cycle at two commercial greenhouses. Significant variations in greenhouse microclimates were observed within the two commercial greenhouses and within an older research greenhouse. Evaporation rates were measured and used as an integrated indicator of greenhouse microclimate conditions. Evaporation rates varied within all three greenhouses and were almost double the lowest rates within one of the greenhouses, suggesting microclimates within a range of greenhouses. Although these microclimate variations caused large variations in the growing substrate water contents of containers within the greenhouses, the growth and quality of the plants were unaffected. For example, no significant correlations were observed between the growth of bellflower plants and the average volumetric water content (VWC), minimum VWC, or maximum VWC of the growing substrate. The change in VWC at each irrigation (DVWC), however, was positively correlated with the fresh weight, dry weight, and growth index (GI) of the bellflowers. For basil, no significant correlations were observed between plant growth and DVWC. This suggests that sensor-based feedback irrigation systems can be used for greenhouse crop production when considerations are given to factors such as the magnitude of microclimate variation, crop species and its sensitivity to water stress, and growing substrate.},

Satellites (e.g., Soil Moisture Active Passive [SMAP] and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [SMOS]) using passive microwave techniques, in particular at L-band frequency, have shown good promise for global mapping of near-surface (0-5-cm) soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 25 to 40 km and temporal resolution of 2 to 3 d. C- and X-band soil moisture records date back to 1978, making available an invaluable data set for long-term climate research. Near-surface soil moisture is further extended to the root zone (top 1 m) using process-based models and data assimilation schemes. Validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products has been ongoing using core monitoring sites, sparse monitoring networks, intensive field campaigns, as well as multi-satellite comparison studies. To transfer empirical observations across space and time scales and to develop improved retrieval algorithms at various resolutions, several efforts are underway to associate soil moisture variability dynamics with land surface attributes in various energy-and water-rich environments. We describe the most recent scientific and technological advances in soil moisture remote sensing. We anticipate that remotely sensed soil moisture will find many applications in vadose zone hydrology in the coming decades.},

Traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring have been employed with some success but limitations in utilising them efficiently across both time and space have led to restrictions in their use. An electromagnetic induction (EMI) technique has been evaluated and used to study the patterns of soil water extraction from a Grey Vertosol in fallow or cropped fields alongside a Eucalyptus argophloia windbreak near Warra, Qld (26.93 degrees S, 150.93 degrees E). This technique provides methods for minimising error caused by seasonal variations in temperature and the vertical distributions of both soil water and temperature. The calibration developed in this study was successful in describing the observed variations in total soil moisture in the surface 0.9m of the soil pro. le (R-2 = 0.93, s.e.= 15.3 mm). We conclude that EMI techniques can provide a quick and efficient means for monitoring soil moisture patterns in agroforestry systems when employed under suitable conditions.

With this in view, efforts have been made in this paper to critically evaluate all the soil moisture measurement techniques, limitations associated with them and the influence of various soil-specific parameters (viz., mineralogy, salinity, porosity, ambient temperature, presence of the organic matter and matrix structure of the soil) on the measured soil moisture content.

The output characteristics, the change in electrical sheet resistance of the PEDOT-PSS film versus the percentage change in relative humidity (\%RH), show that the conductivity of the film decreases when it is exposed to increasing levels of moisture content. The moisture sensors thus fabricated based on the PEDOT-PSS thin film were used to detect the gravimetric water content present in highly plastic (CH) soil samples (Buckshot Clay) for geological and geotechnical engineering applications. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) study of the PEDOT-PSS film on a glass substrate showed the incorporation of OH molecules in the film when it was exposed to moisture environment. This incorporation of OH molecules caused the change in resistance of the PEDOT-PSS film when exposed to moisture content. The change in the output resistance of the sensor device was observed to be from 2.5 to 4.0 M ohm when exposed to soil samples with 15-35\% change in gravimetric water content. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Time domain reflectometry sensors have been combined with heat pulse sensors to produce thermo-TDR sensors. Thermo-TDR sensors are restricted to having relatively short needles to accurately measure soil thermal properties. Short needle lengths, however, can limit the accuracy of the TDR measurement of soil water content. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors are an alternative to TDR sensors that can provide an inexpensive measurement of soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine whether short FDR sensors can accurately measure soil water content. We designed and constructed a short FDR sensor. For four soil types across a range of water contents, temperatures, and salt contents, we measured soil dielectric spectra with the short FDR sensor. A vector network analyzer was used to obtain soil dielectric spectra in the 1-MHz to 3-GHz frequency range. The ideal frequency of a short FDR sensor is the frequency at which the permittivity is not altered by changing temperature or salt content. The 47- to 200-MHz range was an ideal frequency range for measuring soil water content, and 70 MHz was the frequency least influenced by temperature and salt content. The short FDR sensor provided quick, continuous, stable, and cheap measurements of soil water content. Because of the promising performance of the short thermo-FDR sensor in laboratory studies, sensors should be evaluated in future field studies.},

The sensor consists of only simple architectural components, and as such they are inexpensive and lightweight, making it suitable for on-site analysis. The sensing mechanism is proved to be identical to a battery type discharge, reaction wherein polyaniline redox energy changes from the conducting to the nonconducting state with a resulting voltage shift in the presence of soil moisture. Unlike the state of the art soil moisture sensors, a signal derived from the proposed moisture sensor is probe size independent, as it is potentiometric in nature and, hence, can be fabricated in any shape or size and can provide a consistent output signal under the strong aberration conditions often encountered in soil moisture analysis. The sensor is regenerable by treating with 1 M HCl and can be used for multiple analysis with little read out hysteresis, Further, a portable sensor is fabricated which can provide warning signals to the end user when the moisture levels in the kill go below critically low levels, thereby functioning as a smart device. As the sensor is inexpensive, portable, potentiometric, it opens up avenues for developing effective and energy efficient irrigation strategies, understanding the heat and water transfer at the atmosphere land interface, understanding soil mechanics, forecasting the risk of natural calamities, and so on.},

This study evaluated the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the EC-5 and 5TM soil volumetric water content (SVWC) sensors, the MPS-2 and 200SS soil water potential (SWP) sensors, and the 200TS soil temperature sensor. Six 183 cm x 183 cm x 71 cm wooden compartments were built inside a greenhouse, and each compartment was filled with one type of soil from the Mississippi Delta. A total of 66 sensors with 18 data loggers were installed in the soil compartments to measure SVWC, SWP, and soil temperature. Soil samples were periodically collected from the compartments to determine SVWC using the gravimetric method. SVWC measured by the sensors was compared with that determined by the gravimetric method. The SVWC readings from the sensors had a linear regression relationship with the gravimetric SVWC (r(2) = 0.82). This relationship was used to calibrate the sensor readings. The SVWC and SWP sensors could detect the general trend of soil moisture changes. However, their measurements varied significantly among the sensors. To obtain accurate absolute soil moisture measurements, the sensors require individual and soil-specific calibration. The 5TM, MPS-2, and 200TS sensors performed well in soil temperature measurement tests. Individual temperature readings from these sensors were very close to the mean of all sensor readings.},

Therefore, the objectives of this study are to (i) assess the effect of organic matter on the accuracy and precision of SWCM sensors using a commercially available soil water content monitoring sensor; and (ii) account for the organic matter effect on the sensor's accuracy. Sand columns with seven rates of oven-dried sawdust (2\%, 4\%, 6\%, 8\%, 10\%, 12\% and 18\% v/v, used as an organic matter amendment), thoroughly mixed with quartz sand, and a control without sawdust were prepared by packing quartz sand in two-liter glass containers. Sand was purposely chosen because of the absence of any organic matter or salinity, and also because sand has a relatively low cation exchange capacity that will not interfere with the treatment effect of the current work. Sensor readings (raw counts) were monitored at seven water content levels (0, 0.02, 0.04, 0.08, 0.12, 0.18, 0.24, and 0.30 cm(3) cm(-3)) by uniformly adding the corresponding volumes of deionized water in addition to the oven-dry one. Sensor readings were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) affected by the organic matter level and water content. Sensor readings were strongly correlated with the organic matter level (R-2 = 0.92). In addition, the default calibration equation underestimated the water content readings at the lower water content range ({\textless}0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)), while it overestimated the water content at the higher water content range ({\textgreater}0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)). A new polynomial calibration equation that uses raw count and organic matter content as covariates improved the accuracy of the sensor (RMSE = 0.01 cm(3) cm(-3)).

	abstract = {Moisture content determination in agriculture and civil engineering is a common process which needs special sensors with high accuracy, durability and compatibility with the measurement environment. A new 1.4-GHz soil moisture sensor using microstrip transmission line is presented. The proposed sensor consists of two separate parts: (1) A sensor head, which is a microstrip transmission line to be placed in the soil, and (2) an electronic transceiver which sends a sinusoidal wave into the sensor head at one end of the transmission line, and receives the traveled wave from the other end. Transmitter is basically a Colpitts oscillator, and the receiver is a phase detector that measures the phase shift due to velocity variation caused by the moisture content of soil. At a certain frequency, the velocity of a microwave traveling through a media depends on the permittivity of that media. The proposed sensor is implemented and tested on one sample of typical soil. The main advantages of the proposed sensor are its high accuracy, quickness of measurement, its low cost and ease of implementation. Since the sensor has low power consumption, it can be recommended for low-power applications such as wireless sensor network. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Three landsat satellite images 5, 7 and 8 (TM, ETM + and TIRS) were used for this purpose during three different dates (1998, 2008 and 2015). Soil moisture index (SMI) was produced based on calculated Land surface temperature (LST). Fifty five soil profiles have been dug to measure the depth of water tables of the study area. SMI Validation was carried out in 2015 using surface soil samples from the upper 5 cm in which actual moisture content was estimated. Digital change detection techniques for SMI were applied in order to monitor the change in the surface soil moisture along two time periods (1998-2008), (2008-2015). The results indicated that the spatio-temporal variations of soil moisture content are associated with soil texture, landuse/landcover, soil elevation and water table levels. Correlation between actual and retrieved soil moisture revealed a moderate correlation relationship with R-2 = 0.61. Furthermore, an increase of water table eastern the study area. Also the results illustrated the increasing of water table is a direct relation with soil moisture. In addition, an increase in the surface soil moisture (SSM) recognized in 22.06\% of the study area from 1998 to 2008 while, 40.55\% of the area showed an increased in the SSM from 2008 to 2015. This continuous increase in the SSM could be prone to the increasing agricultural expansion and water table levels which, led to conversion of sabkhas to water bodies and fish farms. SMI could be an effective tool in mapping waterlogged areas.},

	abstract = {Coal mining activity in the area of high ground-water level will lead to the destruction, such as ground water and surface slopes. Therefore, crop growth and resident life will be seriously affected by the unevenly soil moisture distribution in this area. It is of important realistic significance to monitor soil moisture in the mining subsidence area with high phreatic water level quickly and accurately at the large-scale. Learning from the experience of remote sensing monitoring of soil moisture, this article analyzes the variation relationship between the spectral data and soil moisture, which are measured in the field surveying and measured the same field-collected samples indoor respectively. The sensitive bands are found according to this relationship and a remote sensing inversion model of the soil moisture is established. Based on TM image, the S-curve optimal model is performed to acquire the soil moisture of the subsidence area. The results show that the spatial distribution of the soil moisture in mining subsidence area with high phreatic water level can be obtained quickly through remote sensing inversion by using this S-curve optimal model.},

While ERT is an established method to detect changes in soil water content, the retrieval of two-dimensional water content distributions from surface-based surveys is a much more challenging application. We conducted a series of experiments on a full-scale dike model comprising rainfall and flooding events. The dike was surveyed with an ERT line down the land-side slope and monitored with permanently installed spatial time-domain reflectometry (TDR) cables for comparison. Water content changes were calculated by applying Archie's equation and agreed well with comparison measurements from spatial TDR measurements. The saturation exponent in Archie's equation was estimated by combining spatial TDR and ERT measurements and agreed well with literature data of comparable sands. The choice of the inversion type, e.g., time-lapse inversion or least-squares versus robust constraint, as well as the influence of inversion parameters, such as regularization and the choice of convergence criterion, is discussed in the context of an apparent inversion artefact for the rainfall experiment, using forward modelling of synthetic data sets. The results indicate that ERT may be a feasible method to quantify water content changes under certain conditions, provided an initial water content estimate is available.},

	abstract = {Triple collocation (TC) is routinely used to resolve approximated linear relationships between different measurements (or representations) of a geophysical variable that are subject to errors. It has been utilized in the context of calibration, validation, bias correction, and error characterization to allow comparisons of diverse data records from various direct and indirect measurement techniques including in situ remote sensing and model-based approaches. However, successful applications of TC require sufficiently large numbers of coincident data points from three independent time series and, within the analysis period, homogeneity of their linear relationships and error structures. These conditions are difficult to realize in practice due to infrequent spatiotemporal sampling of satellite and ground-based sensors. TC can, however, be generalized within the framework of instrumental variable (IV) regression theory to address some of the conceptual constraints of TC. We review the theoretics of IV and consider one possible strategy to circumvent the three-data constraint by use of lagged variables (LV) as instruments. This particular implementation of IV is suitable for circumstances where multiple data records are limited and the geophysical variable of interest is sampled at time intervals shorter than its temporal correlation length. As a demonstration of utility, the LV method is applied to microwave satellite soil moisture data sets to recover their errors over Australia and to estimate temporal properties of their relationships with in situ and model data. These results are compared against standard two-data linear estimators and the TC estimator as benchmark.},

Fractal techniques provide proper tools to analyze soil spatial variability searching for statistical self-similarity patterns among different scales. Although they have been extensively applied to study the soil properties variability, its applicability for the soil water content (SWC) distribution is complicated because requires many data difficult to obtain with the typical point soil water sensors. Recently, a fiber optic distributed temperature sensor has been used to measure soil thermal properties which relate to SWC. These sensors provide large amount of data with high spatial and temporal resolution, thus filling the gap of point soil water sensors. In the present work, soil temperature was measured with a Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) and SWC was estimated by different fitting functions which have been studied with focus on spatial variability. Temperature was measured in a 133 m fiber optic cable laid in a sandy soil field plot. A The Active Heat Fiber Optic (AHFO) method was used, with 12 cm sampling resolution, and heat pulses (19,4 W/m during 2 min) were applied. The temperature data were correlated to SWC, considering the integration of temperature during the heat pulse T-cum, and then the datasets Tcum-SWC were fitted to the best fit statistical function (exponential, potential and polynomial). The results showed that the T-cum distribution presented a non-Gaussian pattern. Additionally, highly anti-persistent patterns have been detected for the larger spatial scaling lags. The function's performance was different thus, the exponential function reproduced better the absolute moments of the temperature profile but it failed reproducing the non-Gaussian behavior.},

A complex dielectric mixing model was calibrated for fine-textured soils (24-45\% clay) and its accuracy was evaluated and compared with empirical calibrations. The Ap and Bt horizons of two soils were packed into columns and adjusted to volumetric water contents (theta) ranging from air dry to near saturation. Travel time and bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(0)) were measured using TDR at temperatures (T) of 8, 22, and 40 degrees C and using three coaxial cables to obtain a range of input spectrum bandwidths (omega(S)). Apparent permittivities (K-a) were predicted using the complex permittivity model with measured theta, T, sigma(0), omega(S), and soil bulk density, and fitted to measured K-a by optimizing specific surface area (A(s)), the power-law exponent (a), and an empirical polarization loss factor. Measured K-a was best approximated using the power-law dielectric mixing model with a semiempirical effective frequency estimate and a = 0.68. Predicted A(S) increased with increasing clay content, cation exchange capacity, and measured specific surface areas. The two-parameter power-law calibration removed temperature bias in theta estimates and reduced the RMSE in theta estimates by an average of 0.006 m(3) m(-3) compared with an empirical calibration. Empirical models predicted field theta with oscillations of up to 0.022 m(3) m(-3) in phase with soil temperatures resulting from permittivity temperature dependencies. In contrast, the calibrated dielectric mixing model removed or dampened in-phase theta fluctuations to {\textless}0.004 m(3) m(-3), which permitted the detection of more subtle changes ({\textless}0.02 m(3) m(-3)) in theta.},

We developed a physically based calibration model to predict the frequency- and temperature-dependent complex dielectric response of soils. The model was used to predict frequency-dependent attenuation and a single “effective” frequency approximation of apparent permittivity of the soil. Effective frequency was predicted to decline from 450 to 160 MHz as water contents increased from air dry to saturation. Predicted frequency decline was small for an input bandwidth of 130 MHz, reflecting that modeled polarization mechanisms associated with relaxation frequencies above 100 MHz were responsible for most of the frequency-dependent attenuation. For specific surface areas ranging from 150 to 300 m(2) g(-1), simulations indicate that ignoring dielectric and conductive losses or the associated decline in effective frequency results in a 5 to 22\% underestimation of the apparent permittivity. Both the power-law and de Loor-Dobson mixing models gave a reasonable approximation to the measured apparent permittivity for a silty clay loam (34\% clay) across the entire water content range. Moreover, the models were able to describe the behavior of apparent permittivity in response to temperature for two soils with contrasting bulk electrical conductivity contributions to losses. These results demonstrate that loss mechanisms and declines in effective frequency need to be considered to accurately predict the soil water content of fine-textured soils.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of evapotranspiration (ET) has evolved over the last 20 years with the development of more robust energy balance approaches and the availability of timely remotely sensed imagery from satellite sensors. This has allowed the use of remote sensing for near-real time water management in irrigated systems in the western United States. In this paper a hybrid ET approach is applied to irrigated and non-irrigated cotton fields at the BEAREX08 experimental site using airborne remote sensing inputs under highly advective conditions, taking advantage of the available root zone soil water content measurements for verification of model output. The modeling approach is based on coupling the Two-Source-Energy Balance (TSEB) and the reflectance-based crop coefficient models. The TSEB model provides estimates of real crop ET while the reflectance-based crop coefficient approach allows for updating the basal crop coefficient and the interpolation and extrapolation of ET between the dates of remote sensing inputs facilitating the maintenance of a soil water balance in the root zone of the crop. Actual ET estimates using the TSEB model were compared with measured ET using eddy covariance systems deployed in four cotton fields during the BEAREX08 experiment. Estimates of soil water content in the soil profile of both irrigated and rain fed cotton fields were compared with measurements at different depths using neutron probe observations. Data assimilation techniques were applied to update soil water content values using estimates based on actual ET from the TSEB model. Results indicate that the hybrid ET modeling approach using data assimilation produced reliable daily ET interpolated between remote sensing observations and significantly improved soil water content estimates throughout the root zone profile compared to applying the crop-coefficient technique in a water balance model without the actual ET inputs.

In this study, we have explored the potential of aerial visible/infrared (VIR) hyperspectral imagery for characterizing soil fertility factors in midwestern agricultural fields. Two fields (SW and NW) in Illinois and two fields (GV and FO) in Missouri were considered in this study. Field data included hyperspectral VIR images and soil fertility parameters including pH, organic matter (OM), Ca, Mg, P, K, and soil electrical conductivity. The VIR images were geo-registered and calibrated into apparent reflectance values. The FO field had the highest average reflectance, followed by SW, GV and NW. The Illinois fields (SW and NW) were high in soil minerals, OM, and soil electrical conductivity. The measured soil fertility characteristics were modeled on first derivatives of the reflectance data using partial least square regression (PLSR). The PLSR model on derivative spectra was able to explain 66\% of the overall variability in soil fertility variables considered in this study, with a predicted residual sum of square (PRESS) of 0.66. The model explained a higher degree of variability in some of the response variables, such as Ca (82\%), Mg (72\%), Veris shallow (86\%), Veris deep (67\%), and OM (66\%), compared to factors such as pH (48\%) and EM (50\%). Analysis of the parameter estimates for each response variable showed that some of the wavebands, such as 625, 652, 658, 661, 754 and 784 nm, explained a high degree of variability in the model, whereas a large number of wavelengths had negligible contribution. In conclusion, this study showed that soil fertility factors important for precision agriculture applications can be successfully modeled on hyperspectral VIR remote sensing data with partial least square regression models.},

	abstract = {There is a need for low-cost, high-accuracy measurement of water content in various materials. This study assesses the performance of a new microwave swept frequency domain instrument (SFI) that has promise to provide a low-cost, high-accuracy alternative to the traditional and more expensive time domain reflectometry (TDR). The technique obtains permittivity measurements of soils in the frequency domain utilizing a through transmission configuration, transmissometry, which provides a frequency domain transmissometry measurement (FDT). The measurement is comparable to time domain transmissometry (TDT) with the added advantage of also being able to separately quantify the real and imaginary portions of the complex permittivity so that the measured bulk permittivity is more accurate that the measurement TDR provides where the apparent permittivity is impacted by the signal loss, which can be significant in heavier soils. The experimental SFI was compared with a high-end 12 GHz TDR/TDT system across a range of soils at varying soil water contents and densities. As propagation delay is the fundamental measurement of interest to the well-established TDR or TDT technique; the first set of tests utilized precision propagation delay lines to test the accuracy of the SFI instrument's ability to resolve propagation delays across the expected range of delays that a soil probe would present when subjected to the expected range of soil types and soil moisture typical to an agronomic cropping system. The results of the precision-delay line testing suggests the instrument is capable of predicting propagation delays with a RMSE of +/-105 ps across the range of delays ranging from 0 to 12,000 ps with a coefficient of determination of r(2) = 0.998. The second phase of tests noted the rich history of TDR for prediction of soil moisture and leveraged this history by utilizing TDT measured with a high-end Hewlett Packard TDR/TDT instrument to directly benchmark the SFI instrument over a range of soil types, at varying levels of moisture. This testing protocol was developed to provide the best possible comparison between SFI to TDT than would otherwise be possible by using soil moisture as the bench mark, due to variations in soil density between soil water content levels which are known to impact the calibration between TDR's estimate of soil water content from the measured propagation delay which is converted to an apparent permittivity measurement. This experimental decision, to compare propagation delay of TDT to FDT, effectively removes the errors due to variations in packing density from the evaluation and provides a direct comparison between the SFI instrument and the time domain technique of TDT. The tests utilized three soils (a sand, an Acuff loam and an Olton clay-loam) that were packed to varying bulk densities and prepared to provide a range of water contents and electrical conductivities by which to compare the performance of the SFI technology to TDT measurements of propagation delay. For each sample tested, the SFI instrument and the TDT both performed the measurements on the exact same probe, thereby both instruments were measuring the exact same soil/soil-probe response to ensure the most accurate means to compare the SFI instrument to a high-end TDT instrument. Test results provided an estimated instrumental accuracy for the SFI of +/-0.98\% of full scale, RMSE basis, for the precision delay lines and +/-1.32\% when the SFI was evaluated on loam and clay loam soils, in comparison to TDT as the bench-mark. Results from both experimnts provide evidence that the low-cost SFI approach is a viable alternative to conventional TDR/TDT for high accuracy applications.},

Commonly used sensors measure the soil moisture locally and exhibit a strong spatial variability due to the heterogeneity of most land surfaces. The new `Free Line Sensing' technology uses existing high-voltage power lines to detect variations in soil moisture below the lines. The electromagnetic field of an additional radio-frequency signal in the range of 50-500 kHz on the line is influenced by changes in the electric properties of the soil, e.g., after rainfall. This has been simulated using high-frequency software, the result being that variations of electrical conductivity or dielectric coefficient of the soil will lead to a measurable effect with power line sections extending over several kilometres. Measurements have been conducted on a 13 km long high-voltage power line. The resulting signal is evaluated with respect to amplitude and phase. Measurement data demonstrate the capability of the `Free Line Sensor' to monitor the integrated soil moisture of the Earth's surface and near subsurface over the area covered by the power line. The resulting signal of the `Free Line Sensor' strongly responds to precipitation events and the following drying of the soil.

	abstract = {Time-domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques have become increasingly attractive for soil moisture evaluation thanks to their adaptability, low cost, and measurement accuracy. Many different TDR-based approaches are currently available for deriving moisture content: empirical calibration curve, empirical dielectric models, frequency-dependent dielectric mixing models, etc. Generally, TDR soil moisture measurements resort to multiple-rod probes, which provide good adhesion to the soil and ease of insertion. However, the typical configuration of such probes does not allow performing a short-open-load (SOL) calibration procedure, which is definitely necessary for retrieving accurate dielectric characterization from TDR waveforms. To overcome the impracticability of the traditional SOL calibration, in this paper, an innovative triple-short calibration (TSC) procedure for commercially available three-rod probes is proposed. First, the robustness of the TSC procedure is validated on well-referenced liquids, demonstrating that its application to TDR measurements leads to a substantial enhancement of the final accuracy in the evaluation of the frequency-dependent reflection coefficient. Successively, the TSC procedure is applied to TDR measurements performed on moistened sand samples. In particular, it is demonstrated that the proposed TSC method, applied to traditional TDR measurements in combination with a dielectric mixing model, leads to an accurate and effective moisture evaluation procedure. This goal is reached through an efficient optimization algorithm that minimizes the difference between experimental and theoretical reflection coefficients. Results show that the proposed strategy is a suitable candidate for low-cost, highly accurate, and easy-to-perform moisture content estimation of soils.},

	abstract = {Landscape assessment of soil moisture is critical to understanding the hydrological cycle at the regional scale and in broad-scale studies of biophysical processes affected by global climate changes in temperature and precipitation. Traditional efforts to measure soil moisture have been principally restricted to in situ measurements, so remote sensing techniques are often employed. Hyperspectral sensors with finer spatial resolution and narrow band widths may offer an alternative to traditional multispectral analysis of soil moisture, particularly in landscapes with high spatial heterogeneity. This preliminary research evaluates the ability of remotely sensed hyperspectral data to quantify soil moisture for the Little River Experimental Watershed (LREW), Georgia. An airborne hyperspectral instrument with a short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) sensor was flown in 2005 and 2007 and the results were correlated to in situ soil moisture values. A significant statistical correlation (R-2 value above 0.7 for both sampling dates) for the hyperspectral instrument data and the soil moisture probe data at 5.08 cm (2 inches) was determined. While models for the 20.32 cm (8 inches) and 30.48 cm (12 inches) depths were tested, they were not able to estimate soil moisture to the same degree.},

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in energy and water partitioning in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. A reliable and operational algorithm is much needed to retrieve regional surface SM at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Here, we provide an operational framework of estimating surface SM at fine spatial resolutions (using visible/thermal infrared images and concurrent meteorological data) based on a trapezoidal space defined by remotely sensed vegetation cover (F-c) and land surface temperature (LST). Theoretical solutions of the wet and dry edges were derived to achieve a more accurate and effective determination of the F-c/LST space. Subjectivity and uncertainty arising from visual examination of extreme boundaries can consequently be largely reduced. In addition, theoretical derivation of the extreme boundaries allows a per-pixel determination of the VI/LST space such that the assumption of uniform atmospheric forcing over the entire domain is no longer required. The developed approach was tested at the Tibetan Plateau Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network (SMTMN) site in central Tibet, China, from August 2010 to August 2011 using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Terra images. Results indicate that the developed trapezoid model reproduced the spatial and temporal patterns of observed surface SM reasonably well, with showing a root-mean-square error of 0.06 m(3)center dot m(-3) at the site level and 0.03 m(3)center dot m(-3) at the regional scale. In addition, a case study on 2 September 2010 highlighted the importance of the theoretically calculated wet and dry edges, as they can effectively obviate subjectivity and uncertainties in determining the F-c/LST space arising from visual interpretation of satellite images. Compared with Land Surface Models (LSMs) in Global Land Data Assimilation System-1, the remote sensing-based trapezoid approach gave generally better surface SM estimates, whereas the LSMs showed systematic underestimation. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the trapezoid method is most sensitive to field capacity and temperature but less sensitive to other meteorological observations and parameters.},

The control variable for comparison was the soil moisture products obtained by spatially interpolating the in situ soil moisture data measured at eight gage locations using the Ordinary Kriging (KR) technique. The results show that the composite soil moisture products are more accurate than the in situ only soil moisture products in estimating the soil moisture for the following cases: (1) when the spatial correlation of in situ soil moisture data is low. Such case includes when there is little rainfall and where the altitude is high (mountainous area) and (2) where the gage density is low or the area located further away from the in situ gages. For both cases, the KR method cannot use enough information due to the low spatial correlation of the in situ measurement for interpolation, while the CM method can take advantage of the satellite soil moisture measurement not affected by the spatial correlation of the in situ data.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks area promising new in situ measurement technology for monitoring soil water content changes with a high spatial and temporal resolution for large areas. However, to realise sensor networks at the small. basin scale (e.g. 500 sensors for an area of 25 ha), the costs for a single sensor have to be minimised. Furthermore, the sensor technique should be robust and operate with a low energy consumption to achieve a long operation time of the network. This paper evaluates a tow-cost soil water content sensor (ECH2O probe model EC-5, Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA) using laboratory as well. as field experiments. The field experiment features a comparison of water content measurements of a forest soil at 5 cm depth using TDR and EC-5 sensors. The laboratory experiment is based on a standardized sensor characterisation methodology, which uses liquid standards with a known dielectric permittivity. The results of the laboratory experiment showed that the EC-5 sensor has good output voltage sensitivity below a permittivity of 40, but is less sensitive when permittivity is higher. The experiments also revealed a distinct dependence of the sensor reading on the applied supply voltage. Therefore, a function was obtained that allows the permittivity to be determined from the sensor reading and the supply voltage. Due to the higher frequency of the EC-5 sensor, conductivity effects were less pronounced compared to the older EC-20 sensor (also Decagon Devices Inc.). However, the EC-5 sensor reading was significantly influenced by temperature changes. The field experiment showed distinct differences between TDR and EC-5 measurements that could be explained to a large degree with the correction functions derived from the laboratory measurements. Remaining errors are possibly due to soil variability and discrepancies between measurement volume and installation depth. Overall, we conclude that the EC-5 sensor is suitable for wireless network applications. However, the results of this paper also suggest that temperature and electric conductivity effects on the sensor reading have to be compensated using appropriate correction functions.

Typically, the quantity to be measured changes either the geometric properties of the structure used as a capacitive sensor or the physical properties of the dielectric between the electrodes of that structure. On the other hand, if the sensor geometry maximizes the capacitance due to fringing, then the possibilities are totally different. In this case, the electric field can be projected onto the test sample. This paper covers the usage of fringing field sensors to measure the water present in the soil. We examine how the geometry of the PCB-made interdigited electrode structure influences the characteristics of the sensor. However, fringing field sensors are difficult to be analytically modeled due to its intrinsic nonlinear characteristic. Therefore, our conclusions were mainly based on results of simulations, but we also tried to reproduce the results of the simulations experimentally. Also, we discuss a circuit that converts the changes in the sensor's capacitance into variations in the width of a pulse signal. Finally, the proposed solution has been experimentally compared with the standard gravimetric method to quantify the water content in the soil. The results were encouraging since the proposed sensor's measurements fit to the experimental data with a coefficient of determination R-2 = 0.94.},

	abstract = {Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations across a continental-scale network in a production framework that incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturer's nominal calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types. This resulted in negative (91\% of samples) and positive (5\% of samples) biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm(3) cm(-3) (1 sigma) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturer's nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to +/- 0.017 cm(3) cm(-3) (+/- 1 sigma). A logistic calibration function further reduced the mean RMSE to +/- 0.016 cm(3) cm(-3) (+/- 1 sigma) and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration applied by 18\% compared with the manufacturer's function. However, the uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (+/- 0.022 cm(3) cm(-3)), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content values increased to +/- 0.028 cm(3) cm(-3) regardless of the calibration function used.},

For the Decagon 5TE sensor such a function is currently not reported in the literature. Data were compared with measurements from underlying mineral soils including laboratory and field measurements. Shrinkage and charring during drying were considered. For both sensors all field and lab data showed consistent trends. For mineral layers with low soil organic matter (SOM) content the validity of the manufacturer's calibrations was demonstrated. Deviating sensor outputs in organic and mineral horizons were identified. For the Decagon 5TE, apparent relative permittivities at a given moisture content decreased for increased SOM content, which was attributed to an increase of bound water in organic materials with large specific surface areas compared to the studied mineral soils. ThetaProbe measurements from organic horizons showed stronger nonlinearity in the sensor response and signal saturation in the high-level data. The derived calibration fit functions between sensor response and volumetric water content hold for samples spanning a wide range of humus types with differing SOM characteristics. This strengthens confidence in their validity under various conditions, rendering them highly suitable for large-scale applications in remote sensing and land surface modeling studies. Agreement between independent Decagon 5TE and ThetaProbe time series from an organic surface layer at the Sodankyla site was significantly improved when the here-proposed fit functions were used. Decagon 5TE data also well-reflected precipitation events. Thus, Decagon 5TE network data from organic surface layers at the Sodankyla and HOBE sites are based on the here-proposed natural log fit. The newly derived ThetaProbe fit functions should be used for hand-held applications only, but prove to be of value for the acquisition of instantaneous large-scale soil moisture estimates.},

Among the reported soil measurement techniques, the TDR is known for the accuracy, robustness and ease of use for in-situ measurement. Even-though TDR is an established technique, high cost and complex design restrict its penetration into the agricultural practices. The complexity of the TDR system is mainly due to the need of time synchronization between the pulse generator which generates the EM wave and sampler which samples the pulse with few hundreds of pico seconds resolution. In IITB\_TDR, the pulse generator and sampler run independent of each other without requiring the time synchronization. The proposed design uses the equivalent time sampling with an adaptive delta modulation and the sampling resolution of 100 ps has been achieved. To analyze the captured TDR signal, a novel time extraction method with wavelet transform based denoising is also proposed in this paper. The IITB\_TDR system and signal analysis technique have been tested with 5 different standard materials and three different types of soil for various levels of moisture. The maximum difference of +/- 2\% and +/- 3\% has been observed with the IITB\_TDR system when compared with the standard oven drying technique and commercial TDR. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Different averaging windows (AW) of the predicted P-ext from successive spectra (2-22) and five recommendation classification intervals (RCI) of elemental P of 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 kg ha(-1) were assigned and tested.

Results showed that among the five RCIs, the minimum elemental P application rate was for interval of 5 kg ha(-1), with small differences of among the different RCIs. In the fields under study, the amount of elemental P fertiliser according to the VR approach was higher than the UR application with an extra elemental P of 4 and 2.38 kg ha(-1) for fields A and B, respectively. However, this higher elemental P fertiliser recommendation of VR is only valid when an equal number of samples (1200 in field A and 660 in field 13) is considered for both VR and UR methods. Larger amounts of elemental P fertiliser were needed for plots and/or fields having higher variation in measured P-ext. The results also showed that in both fields the application rate decreased with larger AWs. Averaging of less than five P-ext successive values was not a proper choice with any RCIs due to the large deviation between the target and classified elemental P into the different RCIs. The combination of RCI 5 and AW between 10 and 15 is recommended to provide a good matching between uniform and applied elemental P at low cost. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Droughts, typically caused by the deficiencies of precipitation and soil moisture, affect water resources and agriculture. As soil moisture is of key importance in understanding the interaction between the atmosphere and Earth's surface, it can be used to monitor droughts. In this study, a High resolution Soil Moisture Drought Index (HSMDI) was proposed and evaluated for meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological droughts. HSMDI was developed using the 1 km downscaled soil moisture data produced from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) from 2003 to 2011 (March to November) over the Korean peninsula. Seven products from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite sensors were used to downscale AMSR-E soil moisture based on random forest machine learning. The downscaled 1 km soil moisture was correlated well with both in situ and AMSR-E soil moisture with the mean coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.29 and 0.59, respectively. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) with time scales from I to 12 months, crop yields (for sesame, highland radish, and highland napa cabbage) and streamflow data were used to validate HSMDI for various types of droughts. The results showed that HSMDI depicted meteorological drought well, especially during the dry season, with a similar pattern with the 3-month SPI. However, the performance fluctuated a bit during the wet season possibly due to the limited availability of optical sensor data and heterogeneous land covers around the stations. HSMDI also showed high correlation with crop yield data, in particular the highland radish and napa cabbage cultivated in non-irrigated regions with a mean R-2 of 0.77. However, HSMDI did not monitor streamflow well for hydrological drought presenting a various range of correlations with streamflow data (from 0.03 to 0.83). (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The current study assesses the potential of two modeling approaches to simulate the daily site water budget in Mediterranean ecosystems. Both models utilize a simplified one-bucket approach but are fed with different drivers. The first model, BIOME-BGC, simulates all main biogeochemical fluxes based on conventional meteorological and ancillary data, while the second uses evapotranspiration estimates derived from the combination of meteorological data and satellite normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. The two models were tested for three Italian sites which are characterized by different vegetation types and ecoclimatic conditions: (i) low mountain coniferous forest; (ii) hilly deciduous forest; (iii) urban grassland. The soil water balance simulated by the two models was evaluated through comparison with daily measurements of soil water content (SWC) taken during a growing season. Satisfactory results were obtained in all cases by both approaches; the SWC estimates are significantly correlated with the measurements (correlation coefficient, r, higher than 0.74), and the mean errors are lower than 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3). The second model, however, generally shows a higher accuracy, which is dependent on the quality of the NDVI data utilized (r higher than 0.79 and errors lower than 0.059 cm(3) cm(-3)). The study therefore provides useful indications for the application of these and similar simulation methods in different environmental situations.},

Measurements made during the early or late season, when soil moisture levels are close to field capacity, are related to the amount of plant available water and soil texture. Combined measurements of water content and electrical conductivity are closely related to the clay and silt fractions of a variable field. The application to early season field mapping of water content, electrical conductivity and clay content is presented. The water and clay content maps are to be used for automated delineation of field management units. Based on a spatial analysis of the soil water measurements, recommendations are made with respect to sampling strategies.

	abstract = {Recent launch of space-borne systems to estimate surface soil moisture may expand the capability to map soil moisture deficit and drought with global coverage. In this study, we use Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture geophysical retrieval products from passive L-band radiometer to evaluate its applicability to forming agricultural drought indices. Agricultural drought is quantified using the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) based on SMAP and soil properties (field capacity and available water content) information. The soil properties are computed using pedo-transfer function with soil characteristics derived from Harmonized World Soil Database. The SMAP soil moisture product needs to be rescaled to be compatible with the soil parameters derived from the in situ stations. In most locations, the rescaled SMAP information captured the dynamics of in situ soil moisture well and shows the expected lag between accumulations of precipitation and delayed increased in surface soil moisture. However, the SMAP soil moisture itself does not reveal the drought information. Therefore, the SMAP based SWDI (SMAP\_SWDI) was computed to improve agriculture drought monitoring by using the latest soil moisture retrieval satellite technology. The formulation of SWDI does not depend on longer data and it will overcome the limited (short) length of SMAP data for agricultural drought studies. The SMAP\_SWDI is further compared with in situ Atmospheric Water Deficit (AWD) Index. The comparison shows close agreement between SMAP\_SWDI and AWD in drought monitoring over Contiguous United States (CONUS), especially in terms of drought characteristics. The SMAP\_SWDI was used to construct drought maps for CONUS and compared with well-known drought indices, such as, AWD, Palmer Z-Index, sc-PDSI and SPEI. Overall the SMAP\_SWDI is an effective agricultural drought indicator and it provides continuity and introduces new spatial mapping capability for drought monitoring. As an agricultural drought index, SMAP\_SWDI has potential to capture short term moisture information similar to AWD and related drought indices. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The analysis period was divided into four periods in keeping with the seasonal variation of soil moisture and considering the characteristics of terrain features. Based on rigorous regression analysis, significant relationships were established between the seasonal mean soil moisture values at point scale and topographic attributes. The cumulative distribution function(CDF) matching technique was employed to upscale the soil moisture from the fine resolution obtained from local measurements to coarser resolution at the watershed scale. The spatial distribution of soil depth can be predicted through the application of the multi resolution valley bottom flatness algorithm. The scaling issues of different resolutions in the terrain analysis could be partially resolved during the CDF matching procedure. However, the uncertainty associated with the complex terrain of the watershed remained in the parameters for the valley bottom evaluation. The spatial distribution of soil water could be predicted in the watershed scale by combing the CDF matching technique with a soil depth prediction scheme.},

The accuracy of the soil water content measurements varied approximately linearly with water content. At volumetric moisture content of 0.05 m(3)/m(3) the standard deviation of the readings was 0.001 m(3)/m(3), and at 0.41 m(3)/m(3) volumetric moisture content the standard deviation was 0.046 m(3)/m(3).

The counties of Wugong and Fufeng in Shaanxi Province, China are used as the study areas to verify the novel SM monitoring approach by using daily ET and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The correlation between LST and ET was higher than 0.8, and the results demonstrated the feasibility of retrieving the SM content using ET in place of LST. In addition, the ET vegetation dryness index (EVDI) feature space can be used to retrieve the SM content through a decision support system for agrotechnology transfer cropping system model. A linear correlation of SM measured at different depths revealed that the EVDI is superior to the TVDI for obtaining soil water content and that soil moisture content measured at 0-10 cm has a high correlation with both the EVDI and TVDI than soil moisture content measured at depths of 20-30, 30-40, and 40-50 cm.},

Point observations of soil moisture are easy to make using established methods such as time domain reflectometry and gravimetric sampling. However, monitoring large-scale variability with these techniques is logistically and economically infeasible. Here passive soil distributed temperature sensing (DTS) will be introduced as an experimental method of measuring soil moisture on the basis of DTS. Several fiber-optic cables in a vertical profile are used as thermal sensors, measuring propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal cycle. Current technology allows these cables to be in excess of 10 km in length, and DTS equipment allows measurement of temperatures every 1 m. The passive soil DTS concept is based on the fact that soil moisture influences soil thermal properties. Therefore, observing temperature dynamics can yield information on changes in soil moisture content. Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that passive soil DTS can detect changes in thermal properties. Deriving soil moisture is complicated by the uncertainty and nonuniqueness in the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture. A numerical simulation indicates that the accuracy could be improved if the depth of the cables was known with greater certainty.},

Soil moisture is a major ecological driver of desert locust populations but is still missing in the current imagery toolkit for preventive management. By means of statistical analyses, combining field observations of locust presence/absence and soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution from a disaggregation algorithm, we assess the potential of soil moisture to help preventive management of desert locust. We observe that a soil moisture dynamics increase of above 0.09cm(3)/cm(3) for 20days followed by a decrease of soil moisture may increase the chance to observe locusts 70days later. We estimate the gains in early warning timing compared to using imagery from vegetation to be 3weeks. We demonstrate that forecasting errors may be reduced by the combination of several types of indicators such as soil moisture and vegetation index in a common statistical model forecasting locust presence. Policy implications. Soil moisture estimates at 1km resolution should be used to plan desert locust surveys in preventive management. When soil moisture increases in a dry area of potential habitat for the desert locust, field surveys should be conducted two months later to evaluate the need of further preventive actions. Remote sensing estimates of soil moisture could also be used for other applications of integrated pest management.

La teledetection est de plus en plus utilisee dans la strategie de lutte preventive. Bien que l'humidite du sol soit une variable ecologique majeure dans la dynamique des populations de criquet pelerin, elle manque a l'arsenal d'outils de teledetection pour cette strategie preventive. A travers des analyses statistiques qui relient les observations de presence/absence des criquets aux estimations d'humidite du sol a une resolution d'un kilometre issues d'un algorithme de desagregation, nous evaluons le potentiel de cet indicateur dans la gestion preventive du criquet pelerin.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key drought indicator; however, current in situ soil moisture infrastructure is inadequate for large-scale drought monitoring. One initiative of the ongoing National Soil Moisture Network program is the development of a near real-time drought monitoring product that integrates in situ, model, and satellite remote sensing data. Data integration from diverse sources requires large-scale validation prior to integration. This study develops a framework for assessing the fidelity of in situ, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets. Here we evaluate data from over 100 in situ monitoring stations that are part of nine monitoring networks; North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Climate Prediction Center land surface models; and Soil Moisture Active-Passive, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) satellite products. The results indicate the majority of in situ stations exhibit low error variance and are spatially representative; however, some networks and individual stations exhibit anomalously high error variance or are sited in a way that make them not spatially representative of a larger area. Overall, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 is the modeled product that consistently performed best, and Soil Moisture Active-Passive L3 is the remotely sensed product that consistently performed the best. They were able to both capture in situ soil moisture variability and provide an accurate depiction of drought conditions. The methods and verification framework applied in this study can be used to evaluate any soil moisture data set in any region of the world. Plain Language Summary Soil moisture is an important indicator of drought; however, there are very few monitoring stations that directly measure soil moisture across the contiguous United States. High-quality model and/or satellite remote sensing soil moisture estimates can help fill in the gaps of in-ground soil moisture measurements. However, integration of soil moisture data from diverse sources requires assessment of data quality. This study applies a series of methods for evaluating the integrity of in-ground, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets across the United States. The results indicate that the majority of in-ground sensors tested exhibit high data quality, although some exhibit high measurement error and/or low spatial representativeness. The results also indicate that the land surface models that are part of the North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and the Soil Moisture Active-Passive remotely sensed soil moisture products best match in-ground soil moisture measurement variability. Additionally, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Soil Moisture Active-Passive data sets accurately depict drought occurrence. The methods applied here can be used to evaluate the quality of soil moisture data sets in any region of the world.},

	abstract = {In the practice of interpolating near-surface soil moisture measured by a wireless sensor network (WSN) grid, traditional Kriging methods with auxiliary variables, such as Co-kriging and Kriging with external drift (KED), cannot achieve satisfactory results because of the heterogeneity of soil moisture and its low correlation with the auxiliary variables. This study developed an Extended Kriging method to interpolate with the aid of remote sensing images. The underlying idea is to extend the traditional Kriging by introducing spectral variables, and operating on spatial and spectral combined space. The algorithm has been applied to WSN-measured soil moisture data in HiWATER campaign to generate daily maps from 10 June to 15 July 2012. For comparison, three traditional Kriging methods are applied: Ordinary Kriging (OK), which used WSN data only, Co-kriging and KED, both of which integrated remote sensing data as covariate. Visual inspections indicate that the result from Extended Kriging shows more spatial details than that of OK, Co-kriging, and KED. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of Extended Kriging was found to be the smallest among the four interpolation results. This indicates that the proposed method has advantages in combining remote sensing information and ground measurements in soil moisture interpolation.},

The mission will produce measurements of brightness temperature by using an innovative Microwave Image Radiometer using Aperture Synthesis at L-Band (MIRAS). The objective of this paper is to assess the possibility to have an operative long term monitoring of the instrument calibration in the SMOS ground segment, by observing large areas of the Earth surface characterized by a stable emmissivity at L-band, with slight variations, when compared with the radiometric accuracy of MIRAS. To this aim, C band signatures collected by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) over the Brazilian rain forest and ERS-2 Scatterometer data over Antarctica have been analyzed, in order to select areas with the best spatial and temporal stability. Extrapolations to L-band have been obtained by using model simulations for the Amazon case and experimental data available in the literature for Antarctica. An operational procedure to monitor the selected areas has been defined to be implemented in the SMOS ground segment.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a variable of paramount importance for a number of natural processes and requires the capacity to be routinely measured at different spatial and temporal scales (e.g., hillslope and/or small catchment scale). The electromagnetic induction (EMI) method is one of the geophysical techniques potentially useful in this regard. Indeed, it does not require contact with the ground, it allows a relatively fast survey of hillslope, it gives information related to soil depth greater than few centimetres and it can also be used in wooded areas. In this study, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) and soil moisture (SM) measurements were jointly carried out by using a multi-frequency EMI sensor (GEM-300) and Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probes, respectively. The aim was to retrieve SM variations at the hillslope scale over four sites, characterized by different land-soil units, located in a small mountainous catchment in southern Italy. Repeated measurements of ECa carried out over a fixed point showed that the signal variability of the GEM-300 sensor (Std. Err. similar to[0.02-0.1 ms/m]) was negligible. The correlation estimated between point ECa and SM, measured with both portable and buried TDR probes, varied between 0.24 and 0.58, depending on the site considered. In order to reduce the effect of small-scale variability, a spatial smoothing filter was applied which allowed the estimation of linear relationships with higher coefficient of correlation (r similar to 0.46-0.8). The accuracy obtained in the estimation of the temporal trend of the soil moisture spatial averages was in the range similar to 4.5-7.8\% v/v and up to the similar to 70\% of the point soil moisture variance was explained by the ECa signal. The obtained results highlighted the potential of EMI to provide, in a short time, sufficiently accurate estimate of soil moisture over large areas that are highly needed for hydrological and remote sensing applications.

	abstract = {A procedure to determine soil moisture threshold (theta*), cover coefficient (k (c)), and parameters of soil moisture stress function (k (s)) is proposed in this study. These coefficients can be further applied to estimate daily actual evapotranspiration in a hydrological model. Two soil moisture stress functions are used to describe k (s). One of the functions is proposed by this study, which assumes moisture stress is inversely proportional to matric potential described by van Genuchten retention curve. The procedure is applied to identify the coefficients for three kinds of reference potential evapotranspiration based on soil moisture monitoring. Soil moisture was measured by Watermark soil moisture sensors. These sensors were tested in a laboratory to establish the relationship between soil moisture and recorded tensor. Then, these sensors were installed in an experimental forest watershed. The verification study shows that the calibrated coefficients can provide reasonable estimate of actual evapotranspiration. The R (2) = 0.85 for using the Penman-Montieth equation for tall maize along with k (c) = 1.81 can be obtained for the validation period with soil moisture stress. Besides, the results also indicate the proposed soil moisture stress function can have better performance on estimating daily actual evapotranspiration at early stage of a dry period. The proposed procedure and soil moisture stress functions can be successfully applied to estimate daily evapotranspiration when soil moisture is known. However, their performance in a hydrological model requires further study, since a hydrological model can only provide estimated soil moisture.},

The selective and sensitive assay is based on recording change in current signal of a positively charged redox probe, hexammineruthenium(III)chloride in the absence and presence of K+ ion in solution. The sensing interface is highly stable and reproducible for detection of K+ ion a under a wide range of concentration 1 to 500 ppm. The detection sensitivity over a wide concentration range was achieved by altering the concentration of redox species. Mechanistically, the recognition properties of 4-aminobenzo-18-Crown-6 covalently bound to the Nafion on carbon surface was found to be selective for potassium ion over sodium, ammonium and calcium ion. Potassium recognition through host-guest binding of crown ether derivative and proposed simplicity of fabrication protocol makes the systems highly promising for real-time applications in soil analysis.},

Within these ranges measurement errors were less than 5\% for soil moisture content and 0.5 cm for water depth.

A handheld TDR meter was used in these experiments. Soil moisture data were correlated with the vehicle mobility index and a simple model for this correlation was derived. Using grassy airfield research, soil moisture data were related to meteorological impacts (precipitation, sunlight, etc.).

	abstract = {A sensor comprising a pair of stainless steel planar electrodes and a capacitance meter is proposed for the real-time monitoring of the moisture content in soil. As rain falls on the ground, the moisture content of the soil between the two electrodes increases. The resulting change in the dielectric constant of the sensingmaterial (soil) produces a corresponding change in the capacitance signal, from which the moisture content can then be inversely derived. The measurement performance of the proposed sensor is enhanced by means of an ion trap mechanism comprising two graphite mesh electrodes positioned orthogonally to the measurement electrodes. A DC voltage is applied to the two electrodes such that the anions and cations in the water are trapped by the positive and negative electrodes, respectively, thereby minimizing their effects on the sensing operation. The experimental results show that the proposed sensor achieves a high degree of sensitivity (i.e., 1.27 mu F/\%) for gravimetric water contents ranging from 21 to 28\%. Moreover, it is shown that the sensor has a repeatability of +/- 0.71\% and +/- 0.55\% for low and high gravimetric water contents, respectively.},

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper to present the probabilistic presentation of SMOS soil moisture using retrieval ensembles. We illustrate that retrieval ensembles effectively mitigated the overestimation problem of SMOS soil moisture arising from brightness temperature errors over West Africa in a computationally efficient way (ensemble size: 12, no time-integration). In contrast, the existing method of Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) matching considerably increased the SMOS biases, due to the limitations of relying on the imperfect reference data. From the validation at two semi-arid sites, Benin (moderately wet and vegetated area) and Niger (dry and sandy bare soils), it was shown that the SMOS errors arising from rain and vegetation attenuation were appropriately corrected by ensemble approaches. In Benin, the Root Mean Square Errors (RMSEs) decreased from 0.1248 m(3)/m(3) for CDF matching to 0.0678 m(3)/m(3) for the proposed ensemble approach. In Niger, the RMSEs decreased from 0.14 m(3)/m(3) for CDF matching to 0.045 m(3)/m(3) for the ensemble approach.},

Capacitance measurement circuit based on resonant principle was then designed. The relationship between the output of the sensor and the soil water content calibration model (beta parameter model), was investigated. As a result, we proposed a two-step calibration beta method. Experimental results showed that beta parameter model appropriately described the relationship between the output and the soil water content, the minimum correlation coefficient R-2 = 0.9554 in the soil, peat, perlite, and vinegar residue. The measurement error of beta parameter model was {\textless}0.025 units except in perlite. The error caused by the change of bulk density was {\textless}0.025 units in peat and vinegar residue.

However, limited research has been carried out to evaluate their precision to measure the volumetric soil water content (theta). The objectives of this research were to: (a) determine the relationship between theta and the theta sensed by four commercially available SMSs, (b) quantify the proportion of scheduled irrigation cycles (SICs) that the SMSs bypassed, and (c) determine the theta at which SICs were allowed or bypassed. Sensors from brands Acclima, Rain Bird, Irrometer, and Water Watcher were buried at 7-10 cm depth, on plots with common bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.]. A calibrated ECH2O probe was also installed in every plot, at the same depth, to monitor theta continuously. When comparing the ECH2O readings with theta sensed by the SMSs, significant correlations were found for the three Acclima RS500 (AC) systems tested, and for two of the three systems of Irrometer Watermark 200SS/WEM (IM) and Rain Bird MS-100 (RB). Most of the SMS-based treatments bypassed the majority of the SICs during rainy periods, and allowed irrigation during the dry periods. On average, 71\% of the SICs were bypassed by the SMS treatments, without detriment to the turfgrass quality. However, most of the SMSs were not found to be precision instruments, because sometimes they bypassed SICs and sometimes they did not, even when reading the same or a lower theta. Considering the average theta range of over which the different SMS treatments always allowed or always bypassed irrigation, brand AC resulted in the significantly narrowest range (1.4\%) followed by RB (3.2\%), suggesting that they were more consistent and precise in measuring theta than Water Watcher DPS-100 (WW) and IM (7.4 and 7.8\%, respectively). These results are consistent with the reported water savings achieved by these SMSs in related studies. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC) and biomass production is important for sustainable resources management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron ratio (N-r) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear relationship between N-r and the aboveground biomass that allowed to continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22 kg/m(2). This information was used together with measured belowground biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error from 0.046 to 0.013 cm(3)/cm(3). We anticipate that future research on the N-r can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception, ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary and roving CRNS systems.},

The primary purpose of this paper is to find an alternative well-established SML-based method to estimate bulk soil moisture directly from the cosmic ray sensors that would effectively replace the current calibration equations. The second aspect of this paper is to find an alternative method to replace the cosmic ray sensor's current expensive and time-consuming field soil sample collection protocol. Data collected over 350 consecutive days from Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) database and Hydroinnova CRS-1000 cosmic ray soil moisture probe deployed in Tullochgorum, Tasmania are used in this paper. Prediction performances of the four supervised estimators, such as sugano type adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (S-ANFIS), multilayer perceptron network, probabilistic neural network, and radial basis function network are evaluated using training and testing paradigms. The best result indicates that S-ANFIS is able to match the results achieved using existing calibration equations with a 87\% accuracy. Secondly, AWAP data trained S-ANFIS is able to predict bulk soil moisture directly from cosmic ray neutron counts with a 92\% accuracy without using any collected field sample-based measurements. Finally, a novel method is also developed to produce an estimated area average bulk soil moisture grid surface map based on multiple ANFIS and cubic grid surface interpolation.},

Measurements of soil water content (SWC) in the subsurface are less common than those near the surface and predictions using numerical models are limited by data availability. Wavelet decomposition of surface measurements of SWC could improve modeling of subsurface SWC by segregating features at different temporal scales and projecting them to the subsurface. The objectives of this work were to: 1) predict subsurface SWC using surface SWC and a combination of wavelet analysis and linear regression, and 2) investigate relationships between soil properties and the movement of soil water at various temporal scales, s. Climate data and SWC at various depths were collected from eight sites in the Atlantic Coastal Plain of the USA. Soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity (k) functions of each horizon were optimized by comparing measured and predicted (using HYDRUS-1D) soil water contents. Each time series of SWC was decomposed into 50 scale components using the Mexican Hat wavelet and later reduced to 5 group components with minimal impact on the characteristics of the signal. Changes in the values of each group component with depth were represented with transfer coefficients that could be estimated with predictors derived from particle size distributions and optimized soil hydraulic functions. Prediction depth and saturated k were the two most important predictors for s {\textless} 256 h, while k at -10 kPa was the best predictor for 256 h {\textless} s {\textless} 724 h, and the median value of particle size diameters for s {\textgreater} 724 h. Subsurface soil water content can be reasonably predicted with the proposed approach, particularly when vertical movement of soil water is unrestricted.},

	abstract = {We have established a soil moisture profile monitoring network in the Raam region in the Netherlands. This region faces water shortages during summers and excess of water during winters and after extreme precipitation events. Water management can benefit from reliable information on the soil water availability and water storing capacity in the unsaturated zone. In situ measurements provide a direct source of information on which water managers can base their decisions. Moreover, these measurements are commonly used as a reference for the calibration and validation of soil moisture content products derived from earth observations or obtained by model simulations. Distributed over the Raam region, we have equipped 14 agricultural fields and 1 natural grass field with soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring instrumentation, consisting of Decagon 5TM sensors installed at depths of 5, 10, 20, 40 and 80 cm. In total, 12 stations are located within the Raam catchment (catchment area of 223 km(2)), and 5 of these stations are located within the closed sub-catchment Hooge Raam (catchment area of 41 km(2)). Soil-specific calibration functions that have been developed for the 5TM sensors under laboratory conditions lead to an accuracy of 0.02m(3)m(-3). The first set of measurements has been retrieved for the period 5 April 2016-4 April 2017. In this paper, we describe the Raam monitoring network and instrumentation, the soil-specific calibration of the sensors, the first year of measurements, and additional measurements (soil temperature, phreatic groundwater levels and meteorological data) and information (elevation, soil physical characteristics, land cover and a geohydrological model) available for performing scientific research.

However, most of them are performed with the constraint of the dry edge of the T-s - VI space to define the maximum water stressed conditions. In view of the subjectivity and uncertainty involved in the determination of the dry edge, a new index termed as the Modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) was developed in this paper to reduce the reliance of the parameterization scheme on the dry edge. In the parameterization scheme of MTVDI, isopleth lines of soil moisture involved in the feature space were retrieved by the temperature-vegetation index method, and only the maximum surface temperature of bare soil (T-smax) was indispensable in the definition of maximum water stressed conditions. For evaluation purpose, the MTVDI was demonstrated in the Southern Great Plains region of the U.S. and was compared with two other traditional soil moisture indexes developed under the constraint of dry edge. The comparison confirmed the effectivity of the MTVDI in monitoring the spatial pattern and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Our analyses also suggest that T-smax, the only parameter needed in the definition of maximum water stressed conditions, can be retrieved directly from the parameterization scheme itself. Therefore, the retrieval of MTVDI can be performed independent of the dry edge, which is a significant improvement to the traditional parameterization schemes of soil moisture from the T-s - VI feature space.},

Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications, the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but significant challenges related to spatial variability and model structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.},

At the 500-m scale, the airborne observations of T-b could not be reproduced using the baseline algorithm of the SMOS Level 2 retrieval scheme, without accounting for soil salinity in the model. The analysis in this letter shows that soil moisture retrieval errors of at least 0.04 m(3)m(-3) (i.e., the entire SMOS error budget) will occur due to salinity alone in SMOS footprints with saline coverage as low as 25\% (possibly even much less). Consequently, fractional salinity coverage cannot be considered a negligible factor by microwave soil moisture satellite missions.},

	abstract = {Ring-capacitor sensors are used widely for real-time estimation of volumetric soil water content theta from measured resonant frequency f(r), which is directly affected by the bulk soil permittivity e. However, the relationship fr( e) requires improved quantification. We conducted laboratory experiments to characterize the response of the Sentek EnviroSMART sensor system for a full range of e values from air to water and a range of temperatures. Water-dioxane mixtures were placed into a solvent-resistant container equipped with custom tools for heating and mixing the fluid, removing air bubbles from sensitive surfaces, measuring permittivity in situ, and creating an axisymmetric metal disturbance to the electric field. Total capacitance C was measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected to one sensor, while four other sensors provided replicated fr readings. The measured temperature response of free water permittivity was linear with a negative slope, which is qualitatively consistent with theory. A precise nonlinear relationship between e and normalized fr was derived. The instrumental error in e was RMSE epsilon = 0.226 ( for {\textless} epsilon {\textless} 43), which corresponds to a measurement precision in theta(epsilon) derived from Topp's equation of RMSE theta= 0.0034 m(3) m(-3). Axisymmetric numerical simulations of the electric field supplemented the experimental results. The characteristic length scale for the distance measured radially from the access tube is 12.5 mm, meaning that 80 and 95\% of the signal are sensed within approximately 20 and 37 mm of the access tube, respectively. The results are crucial for scientific applications of the investigated sensor type to environmental media.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are becoming more popular to monitor spatial and temporal variability of soil water content. The aim of this paper is to calibrate and test the newly developed SPADE sensor for wireless sensor network applications. During calibration, the measured sensor output is related to dielectric permittivity using an empirical calibration in liquids with well-defined permittivities. Using these calibration measurements, we have evaluated sensor-to-sensor variability and compared the accuracy of a universal calibration between sensor output and permittivity with a sensor-specific calibration. Our results showed that the sensor-to-sensor variability of the SPADE sensor is larger than sensor noise and that a sensor-specific calibration can improve the accuracy of soil water content estimation as compared to a single universal calibration. To quantify the effect of temperature on the sensor output, we have derived a temperature correction function in a temperature range from 5 to 40 degrees C. The results showed an underestimation for low temperatures (5 to 25 degrees C) and an overestimation for high temperatures (25 to 40 degrees C). A second-order polynomial function was fitted to the measurements with good agreement (R-2 = 0.9831, RMSE = 0.1489). The transferability of the temperature correction function from reference liquids to soils was verified using saturated coarse sand and a silty loam soil sample. The temperature-corrected SPADE sensor measurements in soil showed good agreement with TDR measurements and corresponded well with theoretical predictions from a dielectric mixing model.},

However, it is still a challenge to retrieve SM data in highly heterogeneous landscapes. By investigating environmental factors (soil, vegetation and topography) and comparing different remote sensing sources (Landsat-8, Radarsat-2, ASTER Global Digital Elevation Model (DEM) V002 (ASTGTM2), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)) for karst mountainous catchments of southwest China, this study identified key controlling factors on the spatial distribution of SM and built a remote sensing model for SM estimation in highly heterogeneous landscapes. Results showed that vegetation type (35.7\%), aspect (7.7\%), height index (4.2\%), soil bulk density (3.3\%), soil total nitrogen (3.1\%), aspect interact with vegetation type (3.4\%) and soil total phosphorous (1.3\%) totally explained 58.8\% of the SM variability. The correlations between SM and topographic derivatives varied with DEM resolutions (1-50 m), and generally reached their highest values at 7 m for height index, slope gradient, and aspect, 16 m for flow accumulation and topographic wetness index, and 43 m for curvature. Partial least-squares regression analysis showed that optical and infrared bands from Landsat-8 and topographic derivatives from UAV photogrammetry DEM were more strongly con-elated with SM than other datasets. An empirical model (SM = 9.27 * 10(-2)HI - 1.82 * 10(-5) B5 + 0.519) with only height index and B5 band from Landsat-8 as inputs is proposed, as it shows acceptable performance (R-2 = 0.36; RMSE = 0.076).

	abstract = {Measurement of the moisture variation in soils is required for geotechnical design and research because soil properties and behavior can vary as moisture content changes. The neutron probe, which was developed more than 40 years ago, is commonly used to monitor soil moisture variation in the field. This study reports a full-scale field monitoring of soil moisture using a neutron moisture probe for a period of more than 2 years in the Melbourne (Australia) region. On the basis of soil types available in the Melbourne region, 23 sites were chosen for moisture monitoring down to a depth of 1500 mm. The field calibration method was used to develop correlations relating the volumetric moisture content and neutron counts. Observed results showed that the deepest “wetting front” during the wet season was limited to the top 800 to 1000 mm of soil whilst the top soil layer down to about 550 mm responded almost immediately to the rainfall events. At greater depths (550 to 800 mm and below 800 mm), the moisture variations were relatively low and displayed predominantly periodic fluctuations. This periodic nature was captured with Fourier analysis to develop a cyclic moisture model on the basis of an analytical solution of a one-dimensional moisture flow equation for homogeneous soils. It is argued that the model developed can be used to predict the soil moisture variations as applicable to buried structures such as pipes.},

	abstract = {In-situ thermal response testing (TRT) has become the most effective way to determine ground thermal parameters before developing renewable geothermal energy systems. However, these parameters may not be static when some hydrologic conditions in porous formation change with time. In this paper, we propose a method for evaluating the ground heat exchange performance using the active distributed temperature sensing (A-DTS) technology, which infers soil moisture by a thermal response caused by active electrical current. We evaluated the feasibility of this method by several lab experiments and a field thermal response test (TRT). Using this method, the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture content was established for silt, clay, organic soil and sand, respectively. To quantitatively evaluate the sensitivity of soil thermal conductivity to moisture content, a new parameter called relative thermal conductivity (beta), is defined to describe the effect of water bridges among soil solid particles on thermal conductivity. The lab test results demonstrate that soil moisture content has significant influence on thermal conductivity when the soil is nearly dry (beta {\textgreater} beta((cri ))), but its effect becomes less evident when the soil is moist(beta {\textless}= beta((cri))). It is found that the relationship between soil moisture content and thermal conductivity can be well fitted by the Johansen model. The results of the field-scale TRT demonstrated the ability of the proposed technique to detect the effects of rainfall on soil thermal conductivity near the ground surface. The field test results also suggest that the soil thermal conductivity measured by in-situ DTS is larger than that obtained from soil samples in lab. However, for rock, the thermal conductivity acquired by DTS is less than the values collected in lab. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A new method for retrieving soil moisture content over vegetated fields, employing multitemporal radar and optical images, is presented. It is based on the integration of the temporal series of radar data within an inversion scheme and on the correction of the vegetation effects. The retrieval algorithm uses the Bayesian maximum posterior probability and assumes the existence of a relation among the soil conditions at the different times of the series. The correction of the vegetation effects models the variation, with respect to the initial time of the series, of the component of the backscattering coefficient due to the soil characteristics as function of the variations of the measured backscattering coefficient and of the biomass. The method is tested on the data acquired throughout the SMEX02 experiment. The results show that measured and estimated soil moistures are fairly well correlated and that the performances of multitemporal retrieval algorithm are better than those obtained by employing one radar acquisition, especially in terms of capability to detect soil moisture changes. Although the approach to correct the vegetation effects on radar observations needs to be further assessed on different sets of data, this finding demonstrates that the proposed method has a potential to improve the quality of the soil moisture retrievals.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an integral quantity in hydrology that represents the average conditions in a finite volume of soil. In this paper, a novel regression technique called Support Vector Machine (SVM) is presented and applied to soil moisture estimation using remote sensing data. SVM is based on statistical learning theory that uses a hypothesis space of linear functions based on Kernel approach. SVM has been used to predict a quantity forward in time based on training from past data. The strength of SVM lies in minimizing the empirical classification error and maximizing the geometric margin by solving inverse problem. SVM model is applied to 10 sites for soil moisture estimation in the Lower Colorado River Basin (LCRB) in the western United States. The sites comprise low to dense vegetation. Remote sensing data that includes backscatter and incidence angle from Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) are used to estimate soil water content (SM). Simulated SM (\%) time series for the study sites are available from the Variable Infiltration Capacity Three Layer (VIC) model for top 10 cm layer of soil for the years 1998-2005. SVM model is trained on 5 years of data, i.e. 1998-2002 and tested on 3 years of data, i.e. 2003-2005. Two models are developed to evaluate the strength of SVM modeling in estimating soil moisture. In model I, training and testing are done on six sites, this results in six separate SVM models - one for each site. Model II comprises of two subparts: (a) data from all six sites used in model I is combined and a single SVM model is developed and tested on same sites and (b) a single model is developed using data from six sites (same as model II-A) but this model is tested on four separate sites not used to train the model. Model I shows satisfactory results, and the SM estimates are in good agreement with the estimates from VIC model. The SM estimate correlation coefficients range from 0.34 to 0.77 with RMSE less than 2\% at all the selected sites. A probabilistic absolute error between the VIC SM and modeled SM is computed for all models. For model I, the results indicate that 80\% of the SM estimates have an absolute error of less than 5\%, whereas for model II-A and II-B, 80\% and 60\% of the SM estimates have an error less than 10\% and 15\%, respectively. SVM model is also trained and tested for measured soil moisture in the LCRB. Results with RMSE, MAE and R of 2.01, 1.97, and 0.57, respectively show that the SVM model is able to capture the variability in measured soil moisture. Results from the SVM modeling are compared with the estimates obtained from feed forward-back propagation Artificial Neural Network model (ANN) and Multivariate Linear Regression model (MLR); and show that SVM model performs better for soil moisture estimation than ANN and MLR models.

	abstract = {The main objective of this research is to develop, test and validate soil moisture retrieval method based on multi-source SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) data for bare agricultural areas. The Radardat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A SAR data were applied to retrieve soil moisture content in combination with the integral equation model (IEM) or calibrated integral equation model (CIEM). A straightforward inversion scheme was developed, which does not require the prior knowledge of surface roughness. The soil moisture content can be directly estimated using a look-up table (LUT) optimization method with multi-source SAR data as inputs. For validation purpose, in situ soil moisture content was measured during the period of SAR data acquisitions. The effectiveness and reliability of the soil moisture retrieval methods were evaluated based on the in situ measurements and cost function distribution graph. The experimental results indicate that the developed approach provided accurate soil moisture estimates with root mean square errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3) to 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3) over the experimental areas. The distribution graphs of the cost function demonstrate the uniqueness and convergence of the estimated results based on multi-source SAR data. Either IEM or CIEM was employed to estimate soil moisture content, more accurate results were obtained with Radarsat-2, TerraSAR-X and Sentinel-1A data as inputs. The experimental results preliminary illustrate that the multi-source SAR data are promising for soil moisture retrieval over bare agricultural areas. The novelty of the presented research can be summarized as two aspects. Firstly, the multi-sensor SAR with different incidence angle, different frequency and different polarization were combined to estimate soil moisture content by means of the physical-based methods. The combination of the multi-sensor SAR data can effectively solve the ill-posed problem of soil moisture retrieval using physical models. Secondly, the CIEM was utilized to establish the soil moisture retrieval model, which transforms the three unknown parameters to two unknown parameters. Furthermore, the convergence and uniqueness of the estimated soil moisture were validated through distribution graphs of the cost function.},

	abstract = {The complex interactions between soil moisture and precipitation are difficult to observe, and consequently there is a lack of consensus as to the sign, strength, and location of these interactions. Inconsistency between soil moisture-precipitation interaction studies can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including the difficulty of demonstrating causal relationships, dataset differences, and precipitation autocorrelation. The purpose of this study is to explore these potential confounding factors and determine which are most important for consideration when assessing statistical coupling between soil moisture and precipitation. Soil moisture is assessed via three remote sensing datasets: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System, the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission Microwave Imager, and the Essential Climate Variable Soil Moisture. Estimates of soil moisture are coupled with afternoon thunderstorm events identified by the Thunderstorm Observation by Radar (ThOR) algorithm, and dry soil or wet soil preferences for convection initiation are determined for over 16 000 thunderstorm events between 2005 and 2007. Differences in soil moisture datasets were found to have the largest impact with regard to determining wet or dry soil preferences. Precipitation autocorrelation is prevalent in the data; however, precipitation autocorrelation did not influence the results with regard to dry or wet soil preferences. Consideration of the convective environment (i.e., weakly or synoptically forced) did result in significant differences in wet/dry soil preference, but only for certain soil moisture datasets. The results suggest that observation-driven soil moisture-precipitation interaction studies should both consider the convective environment and implement multiple soil moisture datasets to assure robust results.},

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) plays significant roles in various scientific fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and ecology. However, the spatial resolutions of microwave SSM products are too coarse for regional applications. Most current optical/thermal infrared SSM retrieval models cannot directly estimate the quantitative volumetric soil water content without establishing empirical relationships between ground-based SSM measurements and satellite-derived proxies of SSM. Therefore, in this paper, SSM is estimated directly from 5-km-resolution Chinese Geostationary Meteorological Satellite FY-2E data based on an elliptical-new SSM retrieval model developed from the synergistic use of diurnal cycles of land surface temperature (LST) and net surface shortwave radiation (NSSR). The elliptical-original model was constructed for bare soil and did not consider the impacts of different fractional vegetation cover (FVC) conditions. To optimize the elliptical-original model for regional-scale SSM estimates, it is improved in this paper by considering the influence of FVC, which is based on a dimidiate pixel model and a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer normalized difference vegetation index product. A preliminary validation of the model is conducted based on ground measurements from the counties of Maqu, Luqu, and Ruoergai in the source area of the Yellow River. A correlation coefficient (R) of 0.620, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.146 m(3)/m(3), and a bias of 0.038 m(3)/m(3) were obtained when comparing the in situ measurements with the FY-2E-derived SSM using the elliptical-original model. In contrast, the FY-2E-derived SSM using the elliptical-new model exhibited greater consistency with the ground measurements, as evidenced by an R of 0.845, an RMSE of 0.064 m(3)/m(3), and a bias of 0.017 m(3)/m(3). To provide accurate SSM estimates, high-accuracy FVC, LST, and NSSR data are required. To complement the point-scale validation conducted here, cross-comparisons with other existing SSM products will be conducted in the future studies.},

	abstract = {The variation and the spatial-temporal distribution of soil water content have significant effects on heat balance, agricultural moisture, etc. A soil moisture (SM) retrieval model can provide a theoretical basis for realizing a rapid test and revealing the spatial-temporal variation of the surface water. However, remote sensors do not measure soil water content directly. Therefore, it is of great importance to establish a SM retrieval model. In this paper, the relationship between SM and diffuse reflectance was first derived using the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient related to SM. Then, based on Kubelka-Munk (KM) theory, the SM retrieval model using reflectance information was further derived, which is a semi-empirical model with an unknown parameter obtained either from fitting or from experimental measurements. The validity and reliability of the model were confirmed with the validation set. The results showed that the root mean square errors of prediction (RMSEPs) of four soils were generally less than 0.017, while the coefficients of determination (R(2)s) of four soils were generally more than 0.85, and the ratios of the performance to deviation (RPDs) of four soils were greater than 2.5 (470-2400 nm). Therefore, the model has high prediction accuracy, and can be well applied to the prediction of water content in different sorts of soils.},

We have previously developed automated irrigation controllers that use capacitance sensors and dataloggers to supply plants with on-demand irrigation. However, the dataloggers and accompanying software used to build and program those controllers make these systems expensive. Relatively new, low-cost open-source microcontrollers provide an alternative way to build sensor-based irrigation controllers for both agricultural and domestic applications. We designed and built an automated irrigation system using a microcontroller, capacitance soil moisture sensors, and solenoid valves. This system effectively monitored and controlled VWC over a range of irrigation thresholds (0.2, 0.3, 0.4, and 0.5 m(3).m(-3)) with `Panama Red' hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella) in a peat:perlite substrate. The microcontroller can be used with both regular 24-V alternating current (AC) solenoid valves and with latching 6- to 18-V direct current (DC) solenoid valves. The technology is relatively inexpensive (microcontroller and accessories cost {\textbackslash}107, four capacitance soil moisture sensors cost {\textbackslash}440, and four solenoid valves cost {\textbackslash}120, totaling {\textbackslash}667) and accessible. The irrigation controller required little maintenance over the course of a 41-day trial. The low cost of this irrigation controller makes it useful in many horticultural settings, including both research and production.},

In this study, we examined six methods-lambda, normalized cumulative temperature increase (TNcum), normalized maximum temperature increase (TNmax), and the reciprocals of each-for theta estimation using the SPHP. The temperature response curves of four soils at different theta were measured following 600-s heat pulses with heating strengths of about 6 W m(-1), from which lambda, TNcum, and TNmax values were determined. The maximum measurement errors of these three methods were 0.11 m3 m(-3) for the coarse sand and 0.01 m(3) m(-3) for the fine sand, sandy loam, and silty clay, except for 0.05 m(3) m(-3) for the fine sand by the lambda(theta) method. The predicted theta from all of the lambda, TNcum, and TNmax methods agreed well with that from the oven-dry method for all soils with the exception of the TNcum(theta) and TNmax(theta) methods for the coarse sand for theta {\textgreater} 0.20 m(3) m(-3). The measurement errors and theta predictions of the 1/lambda(theta) method were similar to that of the TNcum(theta) and TNmax(theta) methods, and that of the 1/TNcum(theta) and 1/TNmax(theta) methods were similar to that of the lambda(theta) method. Because each of the six methods worked well for only some soils, improved estimations were obtained when the lambda(theta) method was combined with the 1/TNcum(theta) [or 1/TNmax(theta)] method for coarse-textured soils and the 1/l(theta) method was combined with the TNcum(theta) [or TNmax(theta)] method for fine-textured soils.},

Loose granular volcanic ashes from the mountainous area north-eastern of Naples, responsible for several large flowslides during the last decades, have been tested. The experiments were aimed at a better understanding of the hydraulic processes leading to slope failure, in order to identify the most useful variables to be monitored for building up effective early warning systems. With respect to this, useful information was provided by coupled measurements of soil suction and volumetric water content, respectively carried out by minitensiometers and TDR, and by slope surface settlement measurements, made with optical laser sensors. In particular, monitoring of soil volumetric water content seemed more useful than soil suction monitoring for early warning purposes, since water content grew smoothly during the entire infiltration processes, while soil suction showed abrupt steep fronts. Furthermore, the obtained results showed how rainfall infiltration was significantly affected by soil volumetric collapse, in turn related to its initial porosity. In addition, during infiltration flume tests with soils showing volumetric collapse, suction resulted nearly in all cases much smaller than expected from laboratory water retention curves. Since steep slopes equilibrium is often guaranteed by cohesion increment due to suction under unsaturated conditions, the obtained results indicate that soil volumetric collapse may be responsible for flowslide triggering when soil is still unsaturated.

	abstract = {A good understanding of the soil water content (SWC) distribution at the field scale is essential to improve the management of water, soil and crops. Recent studies proved that Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) opens interesting perspectives in the determination of the SWC distribution in 3 dimensions (3-D). This study was conducted (i) to check and validate how ERT is able to monitor SWC distribution in a maize field during the late growing season; and (ii) to investigate how maize plants and rainfall affect the dynamics of SWC distribution. Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) measurements were used to validate ERT-inverted SWC values. Evolution of water mass balance was also calculated to check whether ERT was capable of giving a reliable estimate of soil water stock evolution. It is observed that ERT was able to give the same average SWC as TDR (R-2 = 0.98). In addition, ERT gives better estimates of the water stock than TDR thanks to its higher spatial resolution. The high resolution of ERT measurements also allows for the discrimination of SWC heterogeneities. The SWC distribution showed that alternation of maize rows and inter-rows was the main influencing factor of the SWC distribution. The drying patterns were linked to the root profiles, with drier zones under the maize rows. During short periods, with negligible rainfall, the SWC decrease took place mainly in the two upper soil horizons and in the inter-row area. In contrast, rainfall increased the SWC mostly under the maize rows and in the upper soil layer. Nevertheless, the total amount of rainfall during the growing season was not sufficient to modify the SWC patterns induced by the maize rows. During the experimental time, there was hardly any SWC redistribution from maize rows to inter-rows. Yet, lateral redistribution from inter-rows to maize rows induced by potential gradient generates SWC decrease in the inter-row area and in the deeper soil horizons.},

A procedure to calibrate capacitance-resistance probes in saline conditions was implemented in contrasting soils. A low-cost capacitance-resistance probe (ECH2O-5TE, 70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) was used in five soils at four water contents (i.e., from dry conditions to saturation) and four salinity levels of the wetting solution (0, 5, 10, and 15 dS.m(-1)). theta was accurately predicted as a function of the dielectric constant, apparent electrical conductivity (ECa), texture and organic carbon content, even in high salinity conditions. Four models to estimate pore-water electrical conductivity were tested and a set of empirical predicting functions were identified to estimate the model parameters based on easily available soil properties (e.g., texture, soil organic matter). The four models were reformulated to estimate ECp as a function of ECa, dielectric readings, and soil characteristics, improving their performances with respect to the original model formulation.

The primary method of providing this ground truth is to conduct intensive field campaigns with manual surface soil moisture sampling measurements, which utilize gravimetric sampling, soil moisture probes, or both, to estimate the volumetric soil water content. Soil moisture probes eliminate the need for labor-intensive gravimetric sampling. To ensure the accuracy of these probes, several studies have determined these probes need various degrees of localized calibration. This study examines six possible calibration techniques using data collected during a field campaign conducted in 2012, with soil moisture samples being collected over 55 fields in southern Manitoba, as part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Validation Experiment 2012 (SMAPVEX12). The use of a general equation, applied to all collected data, resulted in the largest error regardless of whether a linear or third order polynomial relationship was established for the calibration of the soil moisture probes. Calibration equations based on soil texture or vegetation land cover reduced the error; however, the individual calibration equations established for each field in the study had the lowest error of all the calibration techniques. Although average bias was low for all of the calibration techniques, the use of the general equation to calibrate individual fields resulted in high biases for some fields. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Acquiring spatiotemporal continuous soil moisture observations is therefore of great importance. Weather conditions can contaminate optical remote sensing observations on soil moisture, and the absence of remote sensors causes gaps in regional soil moisture observation time series. Therefore, reconstruction is highly motivated to overcome such contamination and to fill in such gaps. In this paper, we propose a novel image reconstruction algorithm that improved upon the Satellite and In situ sensor Collaborated Reconstruction (SICR) algorithm provided by our previous publication. Taking artificial neural networks as a model, complex and highly variable relationships between in situ observations and remote sensing soil moisture is better projected. With historical data for the network training, feedforward neural networks (FNNs) project in situ soil moisture to remote sensing soil moisture at better performances than conventional models. Consequently, regional soil moisture observations can be reconstructed under full cloud contamination or under a total absence of remote sensors. Experiments confirmed better reconstruction accuracy and precision with this improvement than with SICR. The new algorithm enhances the temporal resolution of high spatial resolution remote sensing regional soil moisture observations with good quality and can benefit multiple soil moisture-based applications and research.},

	abstract = {The objective of this project was to determine if automatic residential irrigation systems with soil moisture sensor irrigation controllers could reduce irrigation water application while maintaining acceptable turfgrass quality as successfully in homes as in plot studies. Research was conducted on-site at cooperating homes (n = 58) in southwest Florida. Experimental treatments were (1) automatic timer with integration of bypass soil moisture sensor control system, (2) automatic timer with rain sensor and educational materials, (3) automatic timer with rain sensor, and (4) automatic timer only (typical for the region). Irrigation application, frequency, quarterly turf quality ratings, and weather data were collected over 26 months. Homes with soil moisture sensor irrigation controllers bypassed unneeded events during both rainy and dry periods, averaging 2 irrigation events per month; all other treatments averaged 4.5-6 events per month. Reduction in number of irrigation events by soil moisture sensor control systems resulted in significant savings, with 65\% cumulative reduction compared to homes with typical timer irrigation control. Observed on-site savings were comparable to previous plot research, indicating that plot savings could be scaled up so long as soil moisture control systems are installed and set properly.

Typically, the sensor was calibrated to measure the volumetric water content (VWC). Experiments were conducted on standard samples from 1\% to 28.2\% VWC to show varying output frequency of soil moisture. Thus sensor response equation, with an R-square of 0.9697 and a 95\% confidence bound, was obtained. Comparing the relative changes of the same sample with the data illustrated by a benchmark sensor, the experimental results showed unanimous in stability and accuracy for commercial use. With the calibration and standardization of the system, a device for defining the soil water status will be available, which served the process of dampness-testing laboratory.

After calibration of the effective heater-thermistor spacing from temperature response measurements in agar, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to demonstrate the potential advantages of the BHPP. Measurement accuracy and robustness of the BHPP were significantly improved compared with the conventional HPP.

The experiment was carried out in an area of 2,502 m(2), where a regular grid with spacing of 10 m was laid out. At each point, time domain reflectometer sensors were installed at depths of 0.05, 0.15, 0.30 m to monitor the SWC for 18 days in 2014 (Jan, Feb and Mar) and 9 days in 2014/2015 (Dec and Jan). The SWC, at the three soil depths, followed a similar and systematic pattern, being highest in the deepest layers, and exhibited temporal stability. The correlation between SWC and clay content varied both with the depth and the magnitude of SWC. During the wet season it is necessary to intensify the sampling density to estimate the SWC, while during the dry season the Spearman rank correlation remained high indicating the need for a small sampling effort only. The driest zones tend to conserve their spatial position more for a longer period than compared to wettest zones.},

The experiments involved SDI systems with emitters installed at different depths and with different spacings along the drip lateral. The HYDRUS software package was used to analyze the field data, assuming modeling approaches in which emitters were represented as (i) a point source in an axisymmetrical two-dimensional domain, (ii) a line source in a planar two-dimensional domain, or (iii) a point source in a fully three-dimensional domain. Results indicated that SDI systems can be accurately described using an axisymmetrical two-dimensional model only before wetting patterns start to overlap, and a planar two-dimensional model only after full merging of the wetting fronts from neighboring emitters.

Thereby the spatial pattern generated by the interaction between multivariate geographic variables can be disclosed, and the goal of geospatial data mining is achieved. A visualisation case study on soil organic matter and nutrients for the Shuangliu County of Chengdu City, China, was performed using the proposed approach. The result shows that the static IconMap can better display the distribution tendency of the high-end and low-end soil organic matter and nutrients, and that the dynamic IconMap can both reflect the interaction between the organic matter and the nutrients variables, and display the soil fertility levels in a comprehensive way. Thus, the IconMap-based visualisation approach is a non-fused, exploratory analytical approach for multivariate data and valuable for visually analyse the soil fertility condition.},

Partial least-squares regression results showed that strong relationships were found between reflectance and P concentration with coefficients of determination of 0-93, 0.95 and 0.76 for total, Mehlich-1 and water-soluble P, respectively, in the near infrared region.

The detected power oscillates (fading), and the amplitude of these oscillations is very sensitive to the soil reflection coefficient at the specular reflection point. Therefore, variations of the reflection coefficient can be mapped, and thus dielectric constant variations, from which soil moisture can be retrieved. This work extends the use of the IPT technique from vertical polarization (V-Pol) to horizontal polarization (H-Pol). Moreover, the IPT equations are reformulated to facilitate the combination of dual-polarization retrievals. Simulations of the interference patterns at V-and H-Pol are presented for different soil moisture conditions. An upgrade of the SMIGOL GNSS-R instrument for dual-polarization observations is presented. This instrument was deployed in a flat, dry grassland in Yanco, Australia, in order to validate the proposed concepts. Finally, a comparison between the data retrieved from the SMIGOL instrument and the ground-truth soil moisture data is presented showing a good agreement between them and rainfall information.},

	abstract = {Near-surface soil conditions (i.e., moisture and temperature) moderate mass and energy exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface. While remote sensing offers an effective means for mapping near-surface moisture content across large areas, in situ measurements, targeting those specific remotely sensed soil depths, are poorly understood and high-resolution near-surface measurement capabilities are lacking. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established, accurate measurement method for soil dielectric permittivity and moisture content. A TDR array was designed to provide centimeter-resolution measurements of near-surface soil moisture. The array consists of nine stainless steel TDR rods spaced 1 cm apart, acting as wave-guide pairs to form eight two-rod TDR probes in series. A critical aspect of the design was matching the spacing of the coaxial cable-TDR rod transition to avoid unwanted reflections in the waveforms. The accuracy of the TDR array permittivity measurement (+/- 1 permittivity unit) was similar to that of conventional TDR as verified in dielectric liquids. Electric field numerical simulations showed minimal influence of adjacent rods during a given rod-pair measurement. The evaporation rate determined by the TDR array compared well with mass balance data in a laboratory test. Near-surface soil moisture profile dynamics were monitored at centimeter-depth resolution using the TDR array in a field experiment where volumetric moisture content estimates (0-8 cm) were within 2\% of conventional three-rod TDR probes averaging across 0 to 8 cm and from 1-to 3-cm depths.},

Capacitance moisture sensors can monitor substrate volumetric water content (theta) and control subirrigation based on minimum theta thresholds, providing an alternative to timers. Our objectives were to automate an ebb-and-flow, subirrigation system using capacitance moisture sensors, monitor moisture dynamics within the containers, and determine the effect of five theta thresholds (0.10, 0.18, 0.26, 0.34, or 0.42 m(3).m(-3)) on hibiscus (Hibiscus acetosella Welw. ex hem.) `Panama Red' (PP20,121) growth. Subirrigation was monitored using capacitance sensors connected to a multiplexer and a data logger and controlled using a relay driver connected to submersible pumps. As the substrate theta dropped below the thresholds, irrigation was turned on for 3 min followed by 3-min drainage. Capacitance sensors effectively controlled subirrigation by irrigating only when substrate theta dropped below the thresholds. Each irrigation cycle resulted in a rapid increase in substrate theta, from 0.10 to approximate to 0.33 m(3).m(-3) with the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) irrigation threshold vs. an increase in theta from 0.42 to 0.49 m(3).m(-3) with the 0.42-m(3).m(-1) irrigation threshold. Less nutrient solution was used in the lower theta threshold treatments, indicating that sensor control can reduce water and thus fertilizer use in subirrigation systems. The water dynamics showed that the bottom part of the pots was saturated after irrigation with theta decreasing quickly after an irrigation event, presumably because of drainage. However, the water movement among substrate layers was slow with the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) irrigation threshold with water reaching the upper layer 5.5 to 20 h after irrigation. The 0.10-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold resulted in 81\% fewer irrigations and 70\% less nutrient solution use compared with the 0.42-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold. However, the 0.10-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold also reduced hibiscus shoot height by 30\%, shoot dry weight 74\%, and compactness by 63\% compared with the 0.42-m(3).m(-3) theta threshold. Our results indicate that soil moisture sensors can be used to control subirrigation based on plant water use and substrate water and to manipulate plant growth, thus providing a tool to improve control over plant quality in subirrigation systems.},

The evaporative drying of a silt loam and a sandy loam was monitored at high spatial resolution in laboratory experiments. The MR data were used to assess the performance of two numerical models: (i) the Richards equation, which considers isothermal liquid water flow, and (ii) a coupled soil water, heat, and vapor flow numerical model. The experimental results reveal two distinct drying regimes for both soil types where, at the onset of the second evaporation stage, a dry surface zone developed with increasing thickness over time. This layer revealed that water loss inside the soil coincided with a relatively low evaporation rate as the liquid continuity to the soil surface vanished. The modeling results clearly demonstrated the need to consider heat and vapor flow. It was shown, as a proof of principle, that MR relaxation time spectra may serve as a proxy to follow desaturation processes where spatially resolved transverse relaxation can reveal a secondary evaporation front.},

	abstract = {Drought is a globally relevant hazard, and while various studies have investigated the relationship between droughts and different climate and ecosystem variables, they are often not global or they do not make use of direct soil moisture observations. Here we use satellite derived soil moisture observations from the Climate Change Initiative of the European Space Agency to quantify the relation between soil moisture drought and temperature, precipitation, evapotranspiration and vegetation during the peak of the growing season. Furthermore, we follow the temporal evolution of the buildup and recovery surrounding the drought peak. We find that in many regions longer-term precipitation deficits are the driving factors of large negative soil moisture anomalies. At the peak of the dry period large anomalies are found for precipitation, evapotranspiration, and temperature, while vegetation indices often show a delayed response. This delay is likely related to the limited information contained in the remotely sensed soil moisture signal on the deeper root zone, thus underestimating the available soil moisture for plants. Anomalies over grasslands are generally larger than over forests, likely linked to the ability of trees to better access water at deeper depths, and to save water during dry conditions. These results illustrate the relevance of remote-sensing based soil moisture as a new independent observation for studying land-vegetation-atmosphere dynamics at the global scale.

Beach characteristics, such as soil moisture, grain size and type, are needed for determining substrate-bearing strength, modeling beach erosion, and planning beach nourishment. Because microwave radiation from soil is strongly dependent on moisture content, soil moisture has traditionally been mapped with airborne microwave radiometers. Innovative antenna technology has enabled microwave radiometers on satellites, such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Aqua, to measure soil moisture on a global scale. Better corrections for surface roughness, vegetation cover, soil temperature, and topography must still be devised, and techniques for sensing soil moisture beyond the top few centimeters developed.},

	abstract = {Satellite remote sensing observations have the potential for efficient and reliable mapping of spatial soil moisture distributions. However, soil moisture retrievals from active microwave remote sensing data are typically complex due to inherent difficulty in characterizing interactions among land surface parameters that contribute to the retrieval process. Therefore, adequate physical mathematical descriptions of microwave backscatter interaction with parameters such as land cover, vegetation density, and soil characteristics are not readily available. In such condition, non-parametric models could be used as possible alternative for better understanding the impact of variables in the retrieval process and relating it in the absence of exact formulation. In this study, non-parametric methods such as neural networks, fuzzy logic are used to retrieve soil moisture from active microwave remote sensing data. The inclusion of soil characteristics and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived from infrared and visible measurement, have significantly improved soil moisture retrievals and reduced root mean square error (RMSE) by around 30\% in the retrievals. Soil moisture derived from these methods was compared with ESTAR soil moisture (RMSE similar to 4.0\%) and field soil moisture measurements (RMSE similar to 6.5\%).

	abstract = {Argania spinosa is an endemic tree of Southwestern Morocco. It grows in arid regions, where annual rainfall ranges between 100 and 300 mm and where no other tree species can live. The aim of the study was to investigate, the root system architecture of Argania spinosa and the temporal dynamics of the root-zone moisture after a rain event, using a geophysical technique called Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI). This technique discriminates by its different resistivity, woody roots, dry soil and moist soil. We tested the ability of three different ERI profile configurations (Dipole-dipole, Wenner and Wenner-Schlumberger) to measure a correct two-dimensional profile. Six measurements (from April to July) of resistivity sections were performed along a 96 m linear transect that included eight trees. Midday shoot water potential (psi(md) and leaf relative water content (RWC) were measured during the experimental period, for the eight trees. The results showed that the Wenner configuration was the most appropriate discriminating resistivities of soil, soil moisture and roots. The 2D resistivity pseudo-sections obtained showed three different layers: one thin resistive layer interspersed by very resistant spots corresponding to woody roots, followed by a middle conductive one corresponding to moist soil, and a deeper layer with moderate resistivities. Moisture content changed substantially over time; being lower over summer than in spring. ERI profiles showed that the resistive layer corresponding to the argan roots, was located between 0 and 4 m of depth. The analysis of the 2D resistivity pseudosections revealed significant differences in soil moisture distribution; so that in the zone under argan roots, soil moisture could be measured down to 6 m deep throughout the whole study period, whereas in the zone outside argan roots, moisture was depleted as early as May down the whole profile. As expected, psi(md), showed minimal values in summer, dropping to -3.3 MPa at the end of the experiment. RWC exhibited a similar pattern. Based on the ERI measuring we conclude that argan roots were not exploiting deep water from the aquifer; instead, they are using soil water at few meters deep. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {This paper presents the comparison of three global soil moisture products (ASCAT, AMSR and SMOS) versus a. land surface model over a region representative of several Mediterranean landscapes located in the Northeast of the Iberian Peninsula. Our approach has been for agricultural and water management applications at the regional and local scale. Despite being a rather small area, we were able to observe different signal behaviours corresponding to major land cover classes in Mediterranean areas i.e.: dryland and irrigated crops, forests and natural vegetation (grass-shrubs). The area also allowed assessing the impact of topography. The first result of the study is that the results are very dependent on the normalizations used to make the data comparable, thus their impact must be carefully analysed. In this study, we applied two different normalisation methods (called ZV35 and ZV) and different moving average windows (1, 10 and 30 days) in order to enhance seasonal effects. Using no smoothing window, ASCAT is the soil moisture product that correlates best with the LSM over all cover classes, whatever the method. Using smoothing window, AMSR-E tends to outperform other soil moisture products with the ZV method. The ZV35 method is not able to identify a small heavily irrigated area. The reason for these different results is that ZV35, tends to eliminate the monthly scale soil moisture memory and therefore becomes more sensitive to precipitation and less sensitive to the monthly evolution of superficial soil moisture. The comparison shows in general good agreement for all soil moisture products with the LSM on the temporal series simulated over flat, non irrigated areas which are not close to the sea. SMOS has difficulties in areas close to the sea and in areas with steep relief and the current version of the L2 Operational Algorithm (V5.51) depicts few values in forested areas. ASCAT, in its turn, shows some limitations over agricultural and natural vegetation where it shows an increase of soil moisture from June to October probably due to increase of penetration depth in dry soil moisture conditions. AMSR-E LPRM shows a clear vegetation cycle over all the land cover classes. From all the remote sensing products, SMOS is the only one able to see irrigation and the only that does not show clear vegetation or roughness effects. In this study, we were able to assess the impact of higher resolution soil moisture products to map irrigated areas. (C) 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

Given recent advances in retrieval algorithms and the approval of a dedicated soil moisture satellite, it is time to re-assess the potential of various satellite systems to provide soil moisture information for hydrologic applications in an operational fashion. This paper reviews recent progress made with retrieving surface soil moisture from three types of microwave sensors - radiometers, Synthetic Aperture Radars (SARs), and scatterometers. The discussion focuses on the operational readiness of the different techniques, considering requirements that are typical for hydrological applications. It is concluded that operational coarse-resolution (25 - 50 km) soil moisture products can be expected within the next few years from radiometer and scatterometer systems, while scientific and technological breakthroughs are still needed for operational soil moisture retrieval at finer scales ({\textless} 1 km) from SAR. Also, further research on data assimilation methods is needed to make best use of the coarse-resolution surface soil moisture data provided by radiometer and scatterometer systems in a hydrologic context and to fully assess the value of these data for hydrological predictions.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important hydrologic state variable critical to successful hydroclimatic and environmental predictions. Soil moisture varies both in space and time because of spatio-temporal variations in precipitation, soil properties, topographic features, and vegetation characteristics. In recent years, air- and space-borne remote sensing campaigns have successfully demonstrated the use of passive microwave remote sensing to map soil moisture status near the soil surface (approximate to 0-0.05 m below the ground) at various spatial scales. In this study root zone (e.g., approximate to 0-0.6 m below the ground) soil moisture distributions were estimated across the Little Washita watershed (Oklahoma) by assimilating near-surface soil moisture data from remote sensing measurements using the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique coupled with a numerical one-dimensional vadose zone flow model (HYDRUS-ET). The resulting distributed root zone soil moisture assessment tool (SMAT) is based on the concept of having parallel noninteracting streamtubes (hydrologic units) within a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The simulated soil moisture distribution at various depths and locations within the watershed were compared with measured profile soil moisture data using time domain reflectometry (TDR). A reasonable agreement was found under favorable conditions between footprint-scale model estimations and point-scale field soil moisture measurements in the root zone. However, uncertainties introduced by precipitation and soil hydraulic properties caused suboptimal performance of the integrated model. The SMAT holds great promise and offers flexibility to incorporate various data assimilation techniques, scaling, and other hydrological complexities across large landscapes. The integrated model can be useful for simulating profile soil moisture estimation and for predicting transient soil moisture behavior for a range of hydrological and environmental applications.},

The objective of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of an empirical relationship to calculate soil moisture from remote sensing data of irrigated soils of the Apodi Plateau, in the Brazilian semiarid region. The empirical relationship had previously been tested for irrigated soils in Mexico, Egypt, and Pakistan, with promising results. In this study, the relationship was evaluated from experimental data collected from a cotton field. The experiment was carried out in an area of 5 ha with irrigated cotton. The energy balance and evaporative fraction (L) were measured by the Bowen ratio method. Soil moisture (q) data were collected using a PR2 - Profile Probe (Delta-T Devices Ltd). The empirical relationship was tested using experimentally collected L and q values and was applied using the L values obtained from the Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) and three TM - Landsat 5 images. There was a close correlation between measured and estimated q values (p{\textless}0.05, R-2 = 0.84) and there were no significant differences according to the Student t-test (p{\textless}0.01). The statistical analyses showed that the empirical relationship can be applied to estimate the root-zone soil moisture of irrigated soils, i.e. when the evaporative fraction is greater than 0.45.},

In this review we provide a synthesis of the efforts made during the last 20 years or so towards the estimation of surface SMC exploiting EO imagery, with a particular emphasis on retrievals from microwave sensors. Rather than replicating previous overview works, we provide a comprehensive and critical exploration of all the major approaches employed for retrieving SMC in a range of different global ecosystems. In this framework, we consider the newest techniques developed within optical and thermal infrared remote sensing, active and passive microwave domains, as well as assimilation or synergistic approaches. Future trends and prospects of EO for the accurate determination of SMC from space are subject to key challenges, some of which are identified and discussed within. It is evident from this review that there is potential for more accurate estimation of SMC exploiting EO technology, particularly so, by exploring the use of synergistic approaches between a variety of EO instruments. Given the importance of SMC in Earth's land surface interactions and to a large range of applications, one can appreciate that its accurate estimation is critical in addressing key scientific and practical challenges in today's world such as food security, sustainable planning and management of water resources.

This letter analyzes the role of multisource remote sensing observations on the upscaling of soil moisture observed by a wireless sensor network at the pixel scale via the regression kriging (RK) method. Three types of auxiliary remote sensing information are employed, including Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI; 90 m), Polarimetric L-band Multiband Radiometer brightness temperature (700 m), and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer TVDI (1000 m). Moreover, a comparison with the ordinary kriging method is analyzed. The spatial inferences show that the RK method is more accurate and that its spatial pattern is more consistent with the auxiliary data when the trend is successfully removed, particularly when spatial continuity is destroyed by irrigation. The ASTER TVDI has a higher resolution and stronger correlation with soil moisture and yields more accurate interpolation results than the other types of remote sensing information. Although medium-resolution data do not substantially contribute to capture the spatial patterns of soil moisture, such data may still improve the prediction accuracy.},

	abstract = {As an important parameter in recent and numerous environmental studies, soil moisture (SM) influences the exchange of water and energy at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere. Accurate estimate of the spatio-temporal variations of SM is critical for numerous large-scale terrestrial studies. Although microwave remote sensing provides many algorithms to obtain SM at large scale, such as SMOS and SMAP etc., resulting in many data products, they are almost low resolution and not applicable in small catchment or field scale. Estimations of SM from optical and thermal remote sensing have been studied for many years and significant progress has been made. In contrast to previous reviews, this paper presents a new, comprehensive and systematic review of using optical and thermal remote sensing for estimating SM. The physical basis and status of the estimation methods are analyzed and summarized in detail. The most important and latest advances in soil moisture estimation using temporal information have been shown in this paper. SM estimation from optical and thermal remote sensing mainly depends on the relationship between SM and the surface reflectance or vegetation index. The thermal infrared remote sensing methods uses the relationship between SM and the surface temperature or variations of surface temperature/vegetation index. These approaches often have complex derivation processes and many approximations. Therefore, combinations of optical and thermal infrared remotely sensed data can provide more valuable information for SM estimation. Moreover, the advantages and weaknesses of different approaches are compared and applicable conditions as well as key issues in current soil moisture estimation algorithms are discussed. Finally, key problems and suggested solutions are proposed for future research.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing of soil moisture effectively provides soil moisture at a large scale, but does not explain highly heterogeneous soil moisture characteristics within remote sensing footprints. In this study, field scale spatio-temporal variability of root zone soil moisture was analyzed. During the Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02), daily soil moisture profiles (i.e., 0-6, 5-11, 15-21, and 25-31 cm) were measured in two fields in Walnut Creek watershed, Ames, Iowa, USA. Theta probe measurements of the volumetric soil moisture profile data were used to analyze statistical moments and time stability and to validate soil moisture predicted by a simple physical model simulation. For all depths, the coefficient of variation of soil moisture is well explained by the mean soil moisture using an exponential relationship. The simple model simulated very similar variability patterns as those observed. As soil depth increases, soil moisture distributions shift from skewed to normal patterns. At the surface depth, the soil moisture during dry down is log-normally distributed, while the soil moisture is normally distributed after rainfall. At all depths below the surface, the normal distribution captures the soil moisture variability for all conditions. Time stability analyses show that spatial patterns of sampling points are preserved for all depths and that time stability of surface measurements is a good indicator of subsurface time stability. The most time stable sampling sites estimate the field average root zone soil moisture value within +/- 2.1\% volumetric soil moisture. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Researchers have recently introduced a new method called diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) to evaluate P availability in soils. The aim of this study was manufacturing DGT gel using copolymerization of acrylamide and allylic double bonds agarose to replace the patented agarose as a cross-linker. We evaluated the efficacy of the prepared gel and used the assembled DGT with that gel in 10 calcareous soils. We compared the available P measured with the assembled DGT in those soils to Olsen's P measured in the same soils. Corn plant (Zea mays L.) was also grown in those soils in a greenhouse for two months. Results showed that the diffusion coefficient of P ions in the gel with 0.3\% of allylagarose at 25 degrees C was 6.9 * 10(-6) cm(2) . s(-1), implying that P ions were allowed to diffuse freely through the prepared diffusive gel. Measured P by the assembled DGT showed a close linear correlation (r(2) = 0.98) with the P concentrations measured in soil solutions extracted by the Olsen method. This demonstrates the prepared allylagarose cross-linked gels' efficiency and thus the reliability of the assembled DGT in easily and rapidly measuring the soil's available P. The P, as measured by the assembled DGT in the examined soils, indicated a little lower correlation coefficient (r = 0.77) than those measured by the Olsen method (r = 0.88). However, the CE values measured by DGT showed a good correlation with P uptake by the roots (r = 0.88, p = 0.01). The best correlation between CE and P content in corn occurred for the measurements made after 48 h of DGT placement in soils. The 20-h measurements had about the same r value, indicating that 20 h is sufficient for the placement of DGT assembly in the soil before its removing and measuring the available P. According to our findings, acrylamide-allylagarose gel as a diffusive gel in DGT was found to be suitable for P measurements in both aqueous solutions and soil.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of soil water content plays a key role in water management efforts to improve irrigation efficiency. Among the indirect estimation methods of soil water content via Earth Observation data is the triangle method, used to analyze optical and thermal features because these are primarily controlled by water content within the near-surface evaporation layer and root zone in bare and vegetated soils. Although the soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer theory describes the ongoing processes, theoretical models reveal limits for operational use. When applying simplified empirical formulations, meteorological forcing could be replaced with alternative variables when the above-canopy temperature is unknown, to mitigate the effects of calibration inaccuracies or to account for the temporal admittance of the soil. However, if applied over a limited area, a characterization of both dry and wet edges could not be properly achieved; thus, a multi-temporal analysis can be exploited to include outer extremes in soil water content. A diachronic empirical approach introduces the need to assume a constancy of other meteorological forcing variables that control thermal features. Airborne images were acquired on a Sicilian vineyard during most of an entire irrigation period (fruit-set to ripening stages, vintage 2008), during which in situ soil water content was measured to set up the triangle method. Within this framework, we tested the triangle method by employing alternative thermal forcing. The results were inaccurate when air temperature at airborne acquisition was employed. Sonic and aerodynamic air temperatures confirmed and partially explained the limits of simultaneous meteorological forcing, and the use of proxy variables improved model accuracy. The analysis indicates that high spatial resolution does not necessarily imply higher accuracies.},

This resulted in the identification of a number of representative stations according to the different scales. Although the temporal stability method was found to be suitable for identifying representative stations, stations based on the mean relative difference (MRD) were not necessarily the most representative of the areal average. Moreover, those identified from standard deviation of the relative difference (SDRD) may be dry-biased. It was also found that in the presence of heterogeneous land use, stations should be weighted based on proportions of agricultural land. Airborne soil moisture products were also shown to provide useful a priori information for identifying representative locations. Finally, recommendations are made regarding the design of future networks for satellite validation, and specifically the most representative stations for the Yanco area. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Field monitoring of soil moisture and groundwater levels is one of the countermeasures against slope failure caused by heavy rainfall. We developed a new monitoring method for soil moisture and groundwater level using ultrasonic waves. An ultrasonic detector in this measuring method is easily installed underground and at low cost, and therefore, this method is useful for multipoint monitoring in a wide field area. However, since the measurement data are greatly influenced by temperature, this temperature-dependent effect must be corrected. Previously, the dummy pair system using two detectors had solved this problem. In this paper, we propose another improved temperature correction method using one detector and evaluate the usefulness of both methods in detail. (c) 2011 The Japan Society of Applied Physics},

	abstract = {Three field experiments examined the effects of soil salinity on volumetric soil water content (SWC) measured with a capacitance sensor (CS). They were conducted in field-grown vegetable crops fertigated with complete nutrient solutions. Experiment 1 compared nutrient solutions with electrical conductivities (ECns,) of 6.5 dS m(-1) ((+)SAL) and 2.4 dS m(-1) (control), applied in equal volumes, following fertigation with ECns of 2.4 dS m(-1). Once (+)SAL commenced, SWC (0-20-cm depth) increased rapidly and then remained approximately 30\% higher than in the control. Soil matric potential (SMP, 10-cm depth) was consistently very similar in both treatments. In Exp. 2, increasing ECns from 2.1 to 5.5 dS m(-1) in irrigation treatments receiving 100\% of crop evaporation (ETc) and 25\% of ETc caused SWC (0-20 cm) to respectively increase appreciably and maintain relatively constant values. Experiment 3 examined the effect of increased salinity and whether normalizing sensors with higher ECns alleviated this effect. Treatments were equal volumes of: (i) ECns of 5 dS m(-1) with sensor normalization at EC of 5.2 dS m(-1) (SAL-N5.2); (ii) ECns of 5 dS m(-1) with normalization at EC of 1.9 dS m(-1) (SAL-N1.9); and (iii) ECns of 1.9 dS m(-1) with normalization at 1.9 ds m(-1) (control). Previously, the three treatments were fertigated with ECns of 1.9 dS m(-1). The SWC (5-15 cm) increased by approximately 10\% in both SAL-N5.2 and SAL-N1.9, and maintained relatively constant values in the control. The SMP (10 cm) was consistently very similar in the three treatments. Normalizing the CS at 5.2 or 1.9 dS m(-1) had no effect on the response to salinity. In the three experiments, changes in SWC generally paralleled changes in EC of soil water (ECsw,); relative increases were 4 to 7.5\% in SWC for each 1 dS m(-1) increase in ECsw.},

	abstract = {Electrical Resistivity Imaging (ERI) was performed in southern Italy, under semi-arid climate, on a Haplic Calcisol soil of two rainfed olive orchards managed according to different soil management (Tillage - T, and Cover Cropping - CC), applied for 8 years. The main aim was to test the usefulness of such geoelectrical method for the assessment of spatial and temporal variability of soil water content for water balance studies. For that purpose, the quality of univariate relationships between soil electrical resistivity (rho) and volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) was tested. Three geoelectrical measurement campaigns were performed in the autumn-spring period of 2006-2007. For each campaign, 3 two-dimensional (2-D) geoelectrical tomographies were carried out in the pole-dipole array using a fixed electrode spacing of 0.25 m. 2-D apparent resistivity pseudosection data sets have been inverted using the software TomoLabe (R). Each covered soil section was 3 m in depth and 11.5 m long. On 14 November 2006 and 18 April 2007 campaigns the ERI were followed by soil samplings carried out with auger directly below the respective geoelectrical profiles. Direct measurements of soil electrical conductivity and soil water content were conducted on the soil samples in situ and in the laboratory. Volumetric soil water content, theta(v) (mm mm(-1)), was significantly related to soil electrical resistivity data, rho (Omega m), by the exponential model theta(v) = 1.641 rho(-0.599) (R = 0.866, n = 84). This relation allowed to assess the change of soil water content in the two orchards during the autumn-spring period and to reveal that the CC plot was more efficient to intercept and store rainwater. ERI technique allowed to highlight differences between the systems in the dynamics of water distribution along the soil profile as an effect of the adopted soil management. In particular, such technique consented to easily evaluate the extent of water content of the deepest soil layers ({\textgreater}1.0 m) evidencing a significant water reserve in the CC plot, convenient for the root system of rainfed olive trees in the driest months. Finally, the soil water content evaluated by means of the ERI technique was used for the short-term application of soil water balance which showed interesting data on the progress of water consumption during the autumn-spring period, particularly useful as operative indications for cover crops management.

It is a combination of two satellite-derived variables-a soil moisture component using the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), and a vegetation component using the Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI). Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) image and in-situ ground observation are introduced to validate the accuracy of the proposed method. Results indicate that MPDI1 is highly consistent to the in-situ ground observation with the coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.49) between MPDI1 and 5-20 cm mean soil moisture, which is slightly higher than the coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.42) between MPDI1 and 10 cm soil moisture. Compared with drought indices such as PDI and the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), MPDI1 provides quite similar trends for bare soil or lower vegetated surface, but it demonstrates a better performance in measuring densely vegetated surface. This paper concludes that MPDI1 provides correct and sufficient information on surface drought status in soil-plant continuum, which appears to have robust available and great potential for surface drought estimation in China and other countries.},

	abstract = {Reflectometry using Global Navigation Satellite Systems signals (GNSSR) has been the focus of many studies during the past few years for a number of applications over different scenarios as land, ocean or snow and ice surfaces. In the past decade, its potential has increased yearly, with improved receivers and signal processors, from generic GNSS receivers whose signals were recorded in magnetic tapes to instruments that measure full Delay Doppler Maps (the power distribution of the reflected GNSS signal over the 2-D space of delay offsets and Doppler shifts) in real time. At present, these techniques are considered to be promising tools to retrieve geophysical parameters such as soil moisture, vegetation height, topography, altimetry, sea state and ice and snow thickness, among others. This paper focuses on the land geophysical retrievals (topography, vegetation height and soil moisture) performed from a ground-based instrument using the Interference Pattern Technique (IPT). This technique consists of the measurement of the power fluctuations of the interference signal resulting from the simultaneous reception of the direct and the reflected GNSS signals. The latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field is shown in this paper. After a review of the previous results, this paper presents the latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field. This new study provides a deeper analysis on the soil moisture retrieval by observing three irrigation-drying cycles and comparing them to different depths soil moisture probes. Furthermore, the height of the maize, almost 300 cm, has allowed testing the capabilities of the technique over dense and packed vegetation layers, with high vegetation water content.},

	abstract = {Plastic mulching (PM) has become an important agricultural practice to improve crop yields worldwide, while there is still a lack of methods to quantify the complex spatial variations of soil water content (SWC) in the PM field. In this study, a methodology for using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) to get SWC information in the PM field was presented. Its performance in monitoring SWC was validated, and the spatial variation of SWC was analyzed using the ERT results. A simplified Waxman and Smits model was selected to calibrate the pedophysical relationship, and it showed good performance (coefficient of determination {\textgreater} 0.92). With the calibrated model, the SWC obtained using ERT showed good agreement with soil moisture sensors in different soil layers (RMSE {\textless} 0.027 cm(3) cm(-3)). The ERT results showed that rainfall and drying events have different effects on SWC at different growing stages. At the early stage, rainfall and drying events mainly influenced SWC on the bare strip, while at the later stage, rainfall and drying events had more obvious effects on the zone near the planting hole. On a seasonal scale, a higher SWC was not only found in the middle part of the mulched strip, but also in the bare strip, while a lower SWC was found in positions near the planting hole. At the same time, a high-resolution ERT measurement revealed that the SWC was also largely influenced by the soil heterogeneity. As such, SWC in the mulched strip was not necessarily higher than in the bare strip as we had supposed, but showed a high degree of irregularity in two dimensions. Considering the irregularity of SWC in two dimensions, our study calls for replacing point-scale measurement with two-dimensional monitoring methods when acquiring SWC information in a field with PM.},

	abstract = {Efficient water use is becoming increasingly important for horticultural operations to satisfy regulations regarding runoff along with adapting to the decreasing availability of water to agriculture. Generally, best management practices (BMPs) are used to conserve water. However, BMPs do not account for water requirements of plants. Soil moisture sensors can be used along with an automated irrigation system to irrigate when substrate volumetric water content (theta) drops below a set threshold, allowing for precise irrigation control and improved water conservation compared with traditional irrigation practices. The objective of this research was to quantify growth of Hibiscus acetosella `Panama Red' (PP\#20,121) in response to various theta thresholds. Experiments were performed in a greenhouse in Athens, GA, and on outdoor nursery pads in Watkinsville and Tifton, GA. Soil moisture sensors were used to maintain theta above specific thresholds (0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, and 0.45 m(3).m(-3)). Shoot dry weight increased from 7.3 to 58.8 g, 8.0 to 50.6 g, and from 3.9 to 35.9 g with increasing theta thresholds from 0.10 to 0.45 m(3).m(-3) in the greenhouse, Watkinsville, and Tifton studies, respectively. Plant height also increased with increasing theta threshold in all studies. Total irrigation volume increased with increasing theta threshold from 1.9 to 41.6 L/plant, 0.06 to 23.0 L/plant, and 0.24 to 33.6 L/plant for the greenhouse, Watkinsville, and Tifton studies, respectively. Daily light integral (DLI) was found to be the most important factor influencing daily water use (DWU) in the greenhouse study; DWU was also found to be low on days with low DLI in nursery studies. In all studies, increased irrigation volume led to increased growth; however, water use efficiency (grams of shoot dry weight produced per liters of water used) decreased for theta thresholds above 0.35 m(3).m(-3). Results from the greenhouse and nursery studies indicate that sensor-controlled irrigation is feasible and that theta thresholds can be adjusted to control plant growth.},

The objective was to simulate the daily soil water content (SWC), actual evapotranspiration, deep percolation and irrigation rates. The accuracy of the application is tested in a semi-arid Mediterranean agricultural landscape with crops over natural conditions. The results of the simulated SWC were compared against 19 in situ stations of the Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network (REMEDHUS), in order to check the feasibility and accuracy of the application. The theoretical basis of the application was the FAO56 calculation assisted by remotely sensed imagery. The basal crop coefficient (K-cb), as well as other parameters of the calculation came from the remote reflectance of the images. This approach was implemented in the computerized tool HIDROMORE+, which integrates various spatial databases. The comparison of simulated and observed values (at different depths and different land uses) showed a good global agreement for the area (R-2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.031 m(3)m(-3), and bias = -0.027 m(3)m(-3)). The land uses better described were rainfed cereals (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.030 m(3)m(-3), and bias = -0.025 m(3)m(-3)) and vineyards (R-2 = 0.86, RMSE = 0.016 m(3)m(-3), and bias = -0.013 m(3)m(-3)). In general, an underestimation of the soil water content is noticed, more pronounced into the root zone than at surface layer.

The ROSCC framework consists of a cloud computing-enabled sensor observation service, web processing service tier, and a distributed database tier. Using MongoDB as the distributed database and Apache Hadoop as the cloud computing service, this study achieves a high-throughput method for remote sensing observation storage and distribution. The map, reduced algorithms and the table structure design in distributed databases are then explained. Along the Yangtze River, the longest river in China, Hubei Province was selected as the study area to test the proposed framework. Using GF-1 as a data source, an experiment was performed to enhance earth observation data (EOD) storage and achieve large-scale soil moisture mapping. The proposed ROSCC can be applied to enhance EOD sharing in cloud computing context, so as to achieve soil moisture mapping via the modified perpendicular drought index in an efficient way to better serve precision agriculture.},

	abstract = {Many environmental and hydrological applications require knowledge about soil moisture. Its measurement accuracy is known to depend on the sensor technique, which is sensitive to soil characteristics such as texture, temperature, bulk density and salinity. However, the calibration functions provided by instrument manufacturers are generally developed under laboratory conditions, and their accuracy for field applications is rarely investigated, in particular over long time periods and in comparison with other sensors types. In this paper, four side-by-side profile soil moisture measurements down to 110 cm using three low-cost sensors and one high-accuracy and high-cost time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensor are compared over a 2-year period at a clay loam site in Switzerland. The low-cost instruments include the (1) 10HS (Decagon Devices, United States), (2) CS616 (Campbell Scientific, United States), and (3) SISOMOP (SMG University of Karlsruhe, Germany) sensors, which are evaluated against the (4) TDR-based TRIME-IT/-EZ (IMKO GmbH, Germany) sensors. For the comparison, the calibration functions provided by the manufacturers are applied for each sensor type. The sensors are evaluated based on daily data regarding their representation of the volumetric water content (VWC) and its anomalies, as well as the respective temperature dependency of the measurements. Furthermore, for each sensor type the actual evapotranspiration is estimated using the soil water balance approach and compared with measurements from a weighing lysimeter. It is shown that the root mean square difference (RMSD) of VWC for the low-cost sensors compared to the TDR measurements are up to 0.3 m(3)/m(3), with highest values in near-surface layers. However, the RMSD for the VWC anomalies are lower compared to those for absolute values. We conclude that under the studied conditions none of the evaluated low-cost sensors has a level of performance consistent with the respective manufacturer specifications. Hence the derivation of site-specific calibration functions is vital for the interpretation of measurements with low-cost soil moisture sensors. Furthermore, some weaknesses of the tested low-cost sensors such as the lack of sensitivity in certain soil moisture regimes or spurious dependency on soil temperature, imply intrinsic issues with the measurements derived with this type of instruments. This is particularly critical for a number of environmental and hydrological applications, including the assessment of remote sensing measurements. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Precision irrigation is crucial in decreasing water demands of irrigated agriculture, which account for the largest source of water withdrawal in most regions. One necessity of precision irrigation is the knowledge of soil moisture content in the root zone of irrigated crops. Dielectric soil moisture sensors can provide this information at a relatively low cost (\$100) compared with other techniques; however, their accuracy cannot be guaranteed in all soils without site-specific calibration, the need for which has limited the use of these sensors. This study examined the Decagon 10HS soil moisture sensor in order to determine the accuracy of the manufacturer-supplied calibration equation on southwest Florida (SWFL) agricultural soils, and analyze whether it performs consistently in different soils found in SWFL. Laboratory calibration of the 10HS was done on four SWFL soils that represent the majority of agricultural land in the region and regression calibration equations were obtained. It was found that the manufacturer calibration equation does not accurately predict soil volumetric water content (VWC) within the +/- 3\% accuracy range specified for the sensor, meriting the need for site-specific calibration. Additionally, it was found that all tested soils behave very similarly, allowing the development of a single calibration equation for use of the 10HS in all SWFL agricultural applications. The calibration equation developed during this research for SWFL could allow a more widespread use of the 10HS in the region. (C) 2013 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a fundamental role in the land-atmosphere exchange process. Spatial estimation based on multi in situ (network) data is a critical way to understand the spatial structure and variation of land surface soil moisture. Theoretically, integrating densely sampled auxiliary data spatially correlated with soil moisture into the procedure of spatial estimation can improve its accuracy. In this study, we present a novel approach to estimate the spatial pattern of soil moisture by using the BME method based on wireless sensor network data and auxiliary information from ASTER (Terra) land surface temperature measurements. For comparison, three traditional geostatistic methods were also applied: ordinary kriging (OK), which used the wireless sensor network data only, regression kriging (RK) and ordinary co-kriging (Co-OK) which both integrated the ASTER land surface temperature as a covariate. In Co-OK, LST was linearly contained in the estimator, in RK, estimator is expressed as the sum of the regression estimate and the kriged estimate of the spatially correlated residual, but in BME, the ASTER land surface temperature was first retrieved as soil moisture based on the linear regression, then, the t-distributed prediction interval (PI) of soil moisture was estimated and used as soft data in probability form. The results indicate that all three methods provide reasonable estimations. Co-OK, RK and BME can provide a more accurate spatial estimation by integrating the auxiliary information Compared to OK. RK and BME shows more obvious improvement compared to Co-OK, and even BME can perform slightly better than RK. The inherent issue of spatial estimation (overestimation in the range of low values and underestimation in the range of high values) can also be further improved in both RK and BME. We can conclude that integrating auxiliary data into spatial estimation can indeed improve the accuracy, BME and RK take better advantage of the auxiliary information compared to Co-OK, and BME outperforms RK by integrating the auxiliary data in a probability form.

	abstract = {In this study, a residual soil moisture prediction model was developed using the stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) and model prediction approach in the Upper Blue Nile basin. The SCA has the advantage of capturing the nonlinear relationships between remote sensing variables and volumetric soil moisture. The principle of SCA is to generate a set of prediction cluster trees based on a series of cutting and merging process according to a given statistical criterion. The proposed model incorporates the combinations of dual-polarized Sentinel-1 SAR data, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and digital elevation model as input parameters. In this regard, two separate stepwise cluster models were developed using volumetric soil moisture obtained from automatic weather stations (AWS) and Noah model simulation as response variables. The performance of the SCA models have been verified for different significance levels (i.e., alpha = 0.01, alpha = 0.05, and alpha = 0.1). Thus, the AWS based SCA model with alpha = 0.05 was found to be an optimal model for predicting volumetric residual soil moisture, with correlation coefficient (r) values of 0.95 and 0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.032 and 0.097 m(3)/m(3) during the training and testing periods, respectively. While in the case of the Noah SCA model an optimal prediction performance was observed when alpha value was set to 0.01, with r being 0.93 and 0.87 and RMSE of 0.043 and 0.058 m(3)/m(3) using the training and testing datasets, respectively. In addition, our result indicated that the combined use of Sentinel-SAR data and ancillary remote sensing products such as NDVI could allow for better soil moisture prediction. Compared to the support vector regression (SVR) method, SCA shows better fitting and prediction accuracy of soil moisture. Generally, this study asserts that the SCA can be used as an alternative method for remote sensing based soil moisture predictions.},

	abstract = {For soil water and solute transport research, time domain reflectometry (TDR) has been commonly used since its introduction to soil research in 1980 by Topp and his colleagues. Although TDR seems to be very versatile for laboratory and field experiments, it requires modest user skills for accurate measurements and the instrument itself is still expensive. A new soil moisture and electrical conductivity (EC) sensor was recently developed at a reduced cost. The new sensor independently measures soil water content, and soil bulk electrical conductivity using frequency phase-shift techniques, and soil temperatures using a thermistor. We evaluated the new sensor for measurements of water content, and EC using three different sensors in variably saturated soils. There was little deviation among the units for water content measurement except at near saturation. Separate exponential curves provided good calibrations for all the soils used in the full range of water content between air-dry and saturation. In saline water up to 54 mS m(-1), the mV output in the EC measurement mode was linearly related to solution EC. Although slopes were quite similar among the three sensors, the intercepts differed from the manufacturer's calibration. The calibrations for volumetric water content and electrical conductivity provided by the manufacturer were not good enough for any use. The temperature effect on volumetric water content could be negligible or easily compensated with a simple formula. Little EC dependency of the sensor on volumetric water content was observed.},

	abstract = {The improvement of water management in agriculture by exactly detecting moisture parameters of soil is crucial. To investigate this problem, a mini inside-out nuclear magnetic resonance sensor (NMR) was proposed to measure moisture parameters of model soils. This sensor combines three cylindrical magnets that are magnetized in the axial direction and three arc spiral coils of the same size in series. We calculated and optimized the magnet structure by equivalent magnetization to current density. By adjusting the radius and height between the cylinders, a circumferential symmetric constant gradient field (2.28 T/m) was obtained. The NMR sensor was set at 2.424 MHz to measure the water content of sandy soil with small particle diameter and silica sand with large particle diameter. The complete decaying, an NMR signal was analyzed through inverse Laplace transformation and averaged on a T-2 space. According to the results, moisture content of the sample is positively correlated with the integral area of T-2 spectrum peak (A(peak)); T-2 of the water in small pores is shorter than that in large pores, because the movement of water molecules are limited by the inner wall of the pores. In the same volume, water in large pore sample is more than that in small pore sample, so A(peak) of silica sand is larger than A(peak) of sandy soil. Therefore, the sensor is capable of detecting moisture both content and pore size of the sample. This mini sensor (4.0 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length) is portable, and the lowest measurable humidity is 0.38\%. Thus, this sensor will allow easy soil moisture measurements on-field in the future.},

The main objective of this research was to evaluate the performance and water conservation potential of a soil moisture sensor system (SMS) in homes that used RW as their source for irrigation, as compared to homes with irrigation timers only, or to homes with educational materials and/or rain sensors. Secondary objectives were to: a) estimate the water depth applied by the different technologies compared to a theoretical requirement (calculated using a daily soil water balance), and b) estimate the effects of local watering restrictions on the amount of RW used by homeowners. In the vicinity of Palm Harbor, Florida, a total of 64 homes supplied with reclaimed water for irrigation (with an average salinity of 0.7 dS/m) were selected for this study. Dedicated irrigation flowmeters were installed in every home. The 64 homes were divided in 4 treatments with 16 homes each. Treatments were: MO (monitored only), SMS, rain sensor, and rain sensor plus educational materials. The SMS treatment was the only group of homes significantly different to MO, reducing the average number of irrigation events per week (1.7 vs. 2.7 events/week, respectively), decreasing the depth of the weekly irrigation (22 vs. 42 mm, respectively), and applying 44\% less water, over the 32 months of data collection. These results indicate that the tested SMS can save a significant amount of RW, compared to the other methods/technologies investigated. Even when all treatments over-irrigated most of the time, SMS irrigated most properly, compared to a theoretical requirement. Finally, under severe dry weather conditions, the local watering restrictions promoted a more efficient use of the RW.},

	abstract = {Instrumented weather stations are often used for evapotranspiration (ET) determination in order to estimate crop water use for irrigation scheduling. A direct estimate of crop water use by subsurface measurements of soil water content has been limited by the high cost of reliable soil moisture sensors. Recent advances in electromagnetic (EM) sensor technology have made automated irrigation scheduling a reality using state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing. our objectives were: (i) to compare irrigation scheduling in turfgrass based on weather station ET estimates with those from a novel time domain transmission (TDT) soil moisture sensor and (ii) to apply a computer-based numerical model to simulate volumetric soil water content (theta) dynamics at the burial depth of the sensor and any drainage occurring below the turfgrass rooting depth. The TDT sensor was designed to directly connect to a custom irrigation controller or to interface a small display/control box with a conventional irrigation timer where irrigation scheduling is based on a threshold water content (theta(Thresh)). The sensor circuitry controlled the irrigation schedule by allowing the preprogrammed schedule to operate whenever the sensor-estimated water content (theta(Sensor)) dropped below theta(Thresh). The TDT sensor was installed under Kentucky bluegrass with a nearby weather station providing estimates of ET for comparison over a period of approximately 7 weeks. The HYDRUS-2D numerical simulation model was used for predicting water content (theta(Sim)) in the soil profile. The model input requirements include the flow domain geometry and boundary conditions, along with estimates of evaporation, transpiration, precipitation, irrigation and root water uptake data. Relative to ET based irrigation recommendations, the TDT system applied approximately 16\% less water when irrigating with a sprinkler having a relative application depth of 0.80 at the position of the sensor (i.e. fraction of the design application rate applied at the sensor). Relative to a fixed irrigation rate of 50 mm week(-1), the TDT system applied approximately 53\% less water. Modeling results of the TDT sensor control indicated that no detectable water drained below the estimated 30 cm rooting depth of turfgrass when uncontrolled application events (e.g. rainfall) were ignored. Performance of the TDT system is dependent on the sensor burial depth and theta(Thresh). The theta(Thresh) value is soil-type dependent and should be established via consideration of theta at field capacity and permanent wilting point. The potential water savings with the TDT system is not only important to water conservation, but can save irrigators an estimated US\$ 5.00-100.00 per month based on average water prices in the US and a 1000 m(2) irrigated turfgrass plot.

In this study, CS655 sensor's performance was investigated through laboratory experiments using a set of liquids with known dielectric and salinity properties and soils featuring a wide range of conditions (including physico-chemical properties, water regimes and salinity of the water solution). The sensor's performance was analyzed in comparison with WET and ML2 theta probe (Delta-T Device Ltd, Cambridge, UK) dielectric sensors. It was found that CS655 apparent dielectric permittivity (epsilon(a)) readings were higher than that of Topp's permittivity-water content relationship, especially at higher soil water content values, as much as 12 dimensionless permittivity units. The results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content (theta(m)) root epsilon(a) and ea was strongly linear (0.911 {\textless} R-2 {\textless} 0.997). The most accurate results were provided by the multi-point calibration method. Moreover, for the case of non-conductive soils, Kelleners's method provides similar epsilon(a) values with CS655 sensor readings for a maximum sigma(b) value of about 0.8 dS m(-1). Concerning the use of empirical calibration equations, which include the effect of bulk electrical conductivity in epsilon(a), the obtained results suggest that the equation theta = a root epsilon(a)+ b + c sigma(b) has a strong physical basis and adequate performance (RMSE {\textless} 0.03 m(3) m(-3)). Finally, the investigation of the epsilon(a)-sigma(b) relationship revealed that it is strongly linear and that slope mainly depends on the pore water electrical conductivity (sigma(p)), which is closely related to the soil solution salinity in contact with plant roots that influences plants growth. The Malliki-Walzcak model provide more reliable sigma(p) predictions as compared to the Hilhorst model.},

In many applications, several TDR probes are installed in soil columns or field setups, and TDR measurements are acquired using a multiplexing system. Commercially available multiplexers share a common ground, which might lead to inaccurate TDR measurements when probes are installed close together or at sites with high electromagnetic noise. Therefore, a new eight-channel differential multiplexer (50C81-SDM) was developed that allows communication with standard TDR equipment. In a first step, the new multiplexer was tested to analyze channel noise and channel to channel variability for open reflection coefficients and travel times. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the channels for both the open reflection coefficient and travel times. Second, the 50C81-SDM multiplexer was tested using TDR probes installed in electrolyte solutions and a sand tank. In contrast to multiplexers with a common ground, they showed no interference of closely spaced TDR probes (spacing ranging from 5 to 95 cm). On the other hand, the SDMX50 multiplexer showed absolute differences in bulk electrical conductivities of {\textgreater}0.001 Sm-1 for high volumetric water contents and high bulk electrical conductivities. Measurements at a test site with high electromagnetic noise showed the applicability of the 50C81-SDM multiplexer in such environments, but only if the entire TDR setup was disconnected from the permanent power supply.},

Tillage treatments were no-tillage and conventional tillage. Preceding crops, in 2-yr rotations, were sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), fallow, and continuous wheat. Nitrogen fertilizer rates were 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha(-1) applied to wheat only. No-tillage did not provide more water at wheat planting for any of the rotations. Preceding crop effect on soil water content (SWC) at planting was as follows: fallow {\textgreater}= faba bean {\textgreater} wheat {\textgreater}= chickpea {\textgreater} sunflower. At harvest, SWC was higher in continuous wheat. Only at harvest were there differences among N fertilizer rates for SWC. Besides, measurement of SWC at harvest for sunflower, chickpea, faba bean, and fallow were performed to determine soil water storage and precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) for 2 yr. Soil water storage was higher for rotations with sunflower or fallow. Nevertheless, fallow PSE was the lowest (10\%). The mean PSE was 29\%. Under the conditions of this study, no-tillage is not more efficient than conventional tillage in soil water accumulation. Fallow is not a useful tool for increasing water availability.},

The main objective of this research was to investigate the mixed effects of texture, disturbance, and salinity on the estimation of theta(v) by the HP Duplicate disturbed and undisturbed samples from three sites with different soil textures (clay, silty clay loam, and sandy loam) were saturated with distilled-deionized water and four saline solutions (corresponding electrical conductivities of 0, 1.23, 2.02, 2.41, and 3.96 dS m(-1)) for three days and then air-dried under laboratory conditions, generating monotonic drying curves. The real (epsilon(r)) and imaginary (epsilon(i)) components of the dielectric permittivity were measured every 5 min by the HP and recorded with a datalogger. Load cells simultaneously recorded changing sample weight over time to provide an independent measure of theta(v). Our results indicate that for the range of conductivities in our samples, there is no benefit to predicting theta(v) from epsilon(r) by also including epsilon(i), or a correction for the loss tangent (i.e., tan delta = epsilon(i)/epsilon(r)). Regression analysis combined with analysis of variance showed that both soil texture and disturbance significantly influenced the estimation of theta(v) from epsilon(n) (p {\textless} 0.05), while salinity or any of the interactions did not significantly influence its estimation. As quantified by the mean absolute error (MAE), the overall accuracy of the HP in this study was 0.0177 cm(3) cm(-3).

Although the use of non-invasive EMI for imaging spatial soil properties is very attractive, the dependence of ECa on several factors challenges any interpretation with respect to individual soil properties or states such as soil moisture (theta). The major aim of this study was to further investigate the potential of repeated EMI measurements to map theta, with particular focus on the temporal variability of the spatial patterns of ECa and theta. To this end, we compared repeated EMI measurements with high-resolution theta data from a wireless soil moisture and soil temperature monitoring network for an extensively managed hillslope area for which soil properties and theta dynamics are known. For the investigated site, (i) ECa showed small temporal variations whereas theta varied from very dry to almost saturation, (ii) temporal changes of the spatial pattern of ECa differed from those of the spatial pattern of theta, and (iii) the ECa-theta relationship varied with time. Results suggest that (i) depending upon site characteristics, stable soil properties can be the major control of ECa measured with EMI, and (ii) for soils with low clay content, the influence of theta on ECa may be confounded by changes of the electrical conductivity of the soil solution. Further, this study discusses the complex interplay between factors controlling ECa and theta, and the use of EMI-based ECa data with respect to hydrological applications.},

	abstract = {An effective temperature correction method for dielectric sensors is important to ensure the accuracy of soil water content (SWC) measurements of local to regional-scale soil moisture monitoring networks. These networks are extensively using highly temperature sensitive dielectric sensors due to their low cost, ease of use and less power consumption. Yet there is no general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors, instead sensor or site dependent correction algorithms are employed. Such methods become ineffective at soil moisture monitoring networks with different sensor setups and those that cover diverse climatic conditions and soil types. This study attempted to develop a general temperature correction method for dielectric sensors which can be commonly used regardless of the differences in sensor type, climatic conditions and soil type without rainfall data. In this work an automated general temperature correction method was developed by adopting previously developed temperature correction algorithms using time domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements to ThetaProbe ML2X, Stevens Hydra probe II and Decagon Devices EC-TM sensor measurements. The rainy day effects removal procedure from SWC data was automated by incorporating a statistical inference technique with temperature correction algorithms. The temperature correction method was evaluated using 34 stations from the International Soil Moisture Monitoring Network and another nine stations from a local soil moisture monitoring network in Mongolia. Soil moisture monitoring networks used in this study cover four major climates and six major soil types. Results indicated that the automated temperature correction algorithms developed in this study can eliminate temperature effects from dielectric sensor measurements successfully even without on-site rainfall data. Furthermore, it has been found that actual daily average of SWC has been changed due to temperature effects of dielectric sensors with a significant error factor comparable to 1\% manufacturer's accuracy.

	abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, launched in January 2015, was designed to provide a global soil moisture product at medium resolution (similar to 9 km), by combining observations from its radar and radiometer. Several downscaling methods have been proposed by the SMAP team for this purpose. This paper evaluates another candidate downscaling method, namely, the Bayesian merging approach. While this has been tested using a synthetic data set across the USA, it is imperative that it can also be tested using the experimental data for a comprehensive range of land surface conditions (i.e., in different hydro-climatic regions) prior to a global application. Consequently, this paper applies this method using the data collected from SMAP experiments field campaigns in southeastern Australia that closely simulated the SMAP data stream for a single SMAP radiometer pixel over a three-week interval. The method studied here differs from the linear downscaling methods of the SMAP mission, in that it uses a nonlinear method based on Bayes' theorem. The medium-resolution soil moisture product is obtained using background soil moisture estimates that are updated according to the difference between the observed and predicted brightness temperatures and backscatter coefficients, relating the high- and low-resolution data. Results were assessed against a reference soil moisture map derived from high-resolution airborne radiometer observations. The root-mean-square-error and R-2 for the Bayesian merging method were found to be 0.02 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.55, respectively, at 9-km resolution, being similar to the SMAP's “optional” downscaling method.},

	abstract = {Rainfall and soil moisture, SM, are two important quantities for modeling the interaction between the land surface and the atmosphere. Usually, rainfall observations are used as input data for modeling the time evolution of SM within hydrological and land surface models. In this study, by inverting the soil-water balance equation, a simple analytical relationship for estimating rainfall accumulations from the knowledge of SM time series is obtained. In situ and satellite SM observations from three different sites in Italy, Spain, and France are used to test the reliability of the proposed approach in contrasting climatic conditions. The results show that the model is able to satisfactorily reproduce daily rainfall data when in situ SM observations are employed (correlation coefficient, R, nearly equal to 0.9). Furthermore, also by using satellite data reasonable results are obtained in reproducing 4 day rainfall accumulations with R-values close to 0.8. Based on these preliminary results, the proposed approach can be adopted conveniently to improve rainfall estimation at a catchment scale and as a supplementary source of data to estimate rainfall at a global scale.

	abstract = {Agricultural drought is characterized by low soil moisture levels that negatively affect agricultural production, but in situ soil moisture measurements are largely absent from indices commonly used to describe agricultural drought. Instead, many indices incorporate weather-derived soil moisture estimates, which is necessary, in part, because the relationships between in situ soil moisture and agricultural-drought impacts are not well quantified. Our objective was to use in situ soil moisture data from monitoring networks in Oklahoma and West Texas to identify a soil moisture-based agricultural drought index that is (i) strongly related to crop-yield anomaly across networks, (ii) comparable across time and space, and (iii) readily understandable. Candidate indices included soil matric potential (MP), soil water storage (SWS), and fraction of available water capacity (FAW), with indices assessed in their raw form and after climatological (i.e., anomalies) or statistical standardization. At the county level, indices related similarly to crop-yield anomaly, with soil moisture-yield anomaly correlation coefficients averaging 0.63, 0.76, and 0.76 for winter wheat, hay, and cotton, respectively. However, standardization was essential to maximize temporal and spatial comparability, and at the regional level, standardized indices were more highly correlated with crop-yield anomaly than non-standardized indices. Our findings show that existing in situ soil moisture datasets can underpin regional drought-monitoring systems. The SWS-anomaly may be the preferred index because it is comparable across space and time, has units that are readily understandable (e.g., mm or inches), and can be broadly applied using data from the many in situ soil-moisture monitoring networks across the world.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is the key link among hydroecological compartments, responding dynamically to sequences of atmospheric processes and management conditions and modulating physical, chemical, and biological processes in the soil. Currently, there are a variety of monitoring techniques to measure, directly or indirectly, the soil moisture. However, some practical issues remain open like the definition a priori of the number, location and depth of the monitoring points, and the impact of failing or poor performance soil moisture sensors. Here, we present a set of techniques, namely Delta theta time series, wavelet filtering, and time stability, to identify representative points and monitoring depths through an analysis of hourly soil moisture time series for different configuration of the monitoring network. We used real data from a monitoring network consisting of seven monitoring points, each one with four EC-5 probes (Decagon Devices Inc., Pullman, WA) at 20, 40, 60, and 100 cm. The use of simple time series of Delta theta allowed us to assess the spatiotemporal influence of the monitoring points, while the wavelet periodograms allowed us to get insight about the response of the monitoring points at different time scales. Both methods are easy to implement or adapt to specific conditions, being coherent to the results derived from time stability analysis. For our case study, we concluded that we could reallocate 16 sensors (out of 28) without a significant loss of information. However, the final decision strongly relies on a deep knowledge of the site features and the objectives of the monitoring network.},

	abstract = {This paper develops two alternative approaches for downscaling passive microwave-derived soil moisture. Ground and airborne data collected over the Walnut Gulch experimental watershed during the Monsoon'90 experiment were used to test these approaches. These data consisted of eight micrometeorological stations (METFLUX) and six flights of the L-band Push Broom Microwave Radiometer (PBMR). For each PBMR flight, the 180-m resolution L-band pixels covering the eight METFLUX sites were first aggregated to generate a 500-m “coarse-scale” passive microwave pixel. The coarse-scale-derived soil moisture was then downscaled to the 180-m resolution using two different surface soil moisture indexes (SMIs): 1) the evaporative fraction (EF), which is the ratio of the evapotranspiration to the total energy available at the surface; and 2) the actual EF (AEF), which is defined as the ratio of the actual-to-potential evapotranspiration. It is well known that both SMIs depend on the surface soil moisture. However, they are also influenced by other factors such as vegetation cover, soil type, root-zone soil moisture, and atmospheric conditions. In order to decouple the influence of soil moisture from the other factors, a land surface model was used to account for the heterogeneity of vegetation cover, soil type, and atmospheric conditions. The overall accuracy in the downscaled values was evaluated to 3\% (vol.) for EF and 2\% (vol.) for AEF under cloud-free conditions. These results illustrate the potential use of satellite-based estimates of instantaneous evapotranspiration on clear-sky days for downscaling the coarse-resolution passive microwave soil moisture.},

A more straightforward and consistent model of this emission results if nonuniform, rather than uniform, plane waves are used. Adaptation of this new model to a layered medium representation for the soil is improved using a normalization that is based on the isothermal soil limit. The separate concepts of radiometer sensing depth and in situ sampling depth for soil moisture are examined and theory for the sensing depth is presented. Improved approximations (at 1413 MHz) to the full model for soil emission are developed since they are needed to construct algorithms that retrieve an estimate of soil moisture from the radiometer raw measurement. The error associated with the comparison of these remotely sense values against in situ measurements is calculated. Results suggest that this comparison error could be lowered if the soil moisture sampling depth was reduced to values less than 0.01 m from the currently used values near 0.02 m, although the effect of surface roughness has not yet been analyzed.},

Validation stations, located in the Sierra Nevada, include transect of sites that cross the rain-to-snow transition and a cluster of sites located at similar elevations in a snow-dominated watershed. The SMRUs capture unique responses to varying climate conditions characterized by statistical measures of central tendency, dispersion, and extremes. A topographic position index and landform classification is the final step in the workflow to guide the optimal placement of soil moisture sensors at the local-scale. The proposed workflow is highly flexible and can be implemented over a range of spatial scales and input datasets can be customized.

	abstract = {In this study, the influence of land use on soil moisture dynamics is investigated for monitoring purposes. To this end, 23 measurement campaigns were carried out during a period of 8 months at 5 sites located in central Italy, within a catchment of similar to 6 km(2). The sites are characterized by different land uses: grassland, woodland (holm oak and hornbeam) olive grove and cropland. Soil moisture was measured with a portable Time Domain Reflectometer for a layer depth of 15 cm under the soil surface. The optimization of the monitoring scheme was addressed through a statistical and temporal stability analysis. Notwithstanding the significant differences in the land use, the temporal patterns of the field-mean soil moisture of the different sites were very similar while the spatial variability, expressed through the coefficient of variation, was found slightly higher (average value equal to 0.27) than that obtained from previous sampling campaigns on the same area but on sites characterized by a homogeneous soil use. The maximum number of required samples, to estimate the areal mean soil moisture within an accuracy of 2\% vol/vol, was found ranging between 7 and 11 at the field scale and equal to 20 at the catchment scale. The temporal stability analysis allowed to identify the grassland site as the most representative of the catchment-mean soil moisture behavior (coefficient of determination, R-2 = 0.96). Therefore, even though the heterogeneity of the land use increases the spatial variability (as expected), soil moisture exhibits a significant temporal stability and its large scale monitoring from few observations is still feasible.

The NN was trained on GEOS-5 soil moisture target data, making the NN estimates consistent with the GEOS-5 climatology, such that they may ultimately be assimilated into this model without further bias correction. Evaluated against in situ soil moisture measurements, the average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE), correlation and anomaly correlation of the NN retrievals were 0.037 m(3)m(-3), 0.70 and 0.66, respectively, against SMAP core validation site measurements and 0.026 m(3)m(-3), 0.58 and 0.48, respectively, against International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) measurements. At the core validation sites, the NN retrievals have a significantly higher skill than the GEOS-5 model estimates and a slightly lower correlation skill than the SMAP Level-2 Passive (L2P) product. The feasibility of the NN method was reflected by a lower ubRMSE compared to the L2P retrievals as well as a higher skill when ancillary parameters in physically-based retrievals were uncertain. Against ISMN measurements, the skill of the two retrieval products was more comparable. A triple collocation analysis against Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) soil moisture retrievals showed that the NN and L2P retrieval errors have a similar spatial distribution, but the NN retrieval errors are generally lower in densely vegetated regions and transition zones.},

	abstract = {Measuring soil moisture with cosmic-ray neutrons is a promising technique for intermediate spatial scales. To convert neutron counts to average volumetric soil water content a simple calibration function can be used (the N-0-calibration of Desilets et al., 2010). The calibration is based on soil water content derived directly from soil samples taken within the footprint of the sensor. We installed a cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRS) in a mixed forest in the lowlands of north-eastern Germany and calibrated it 10 times throughout one calendar year. Each calibration with the N-0-calibration function resulted in a different CRS soil moisture time series, with deviations of up to 0.1 m(3) m(-3) (24\% of the total range) for individual values of soil water content. Also, many of the calibration efforts resulted in time series that could not be matched with independent in situ measurements of soil water content. We therefore suggest a modified calibration function with a different shape that can vary from one location to another. A two-point calibration was found to effectively define the shape of the modified calibration function if the calibration points were taken during both dry and wet conditions spanning at least half of the total range of soil moisture. The best results were obtained when the soil samples used for calibration were linearly weighted as a function of depth in the soil profile and nonlinearly weighted as a function of distance from the CRS, and when the depth-specific amount of soil organic matter and lattice water content was explicitly considered. The annual cycle of tree foliation was found to be a negligible factor for calibration because the variable hydrogen mass in the leaves was small compared to the hydrogen mass changes by soil moisture variations. As a final point, we provide a calibration guide for a CRS in forested environments.},

However, the signal shows complex and non-unique response to all hydrogen pools near the land surface, providing some challenges for soil moisture estimation in practical applications. Aims of the study were 1) to assess the uncertainty of CRNS as a stand-alone approach to estimate volumetric soil moisture in cropped field 2) to identify the causes of this uncertainty 3) and possible improvements. Two experimental sites in Germany were equipped with a CRNS probe and point-scale soil moisture network. Additional monitoring activities were conducted during the crop growing season to characterize the soil-plant systems. This data is used to identify and quantify the different sources of uncertainty (factors). An uncertainty analysis, based on Monte Carlo approach, is applied to propagate these uncertainties to CRNS soil moisture estimations. In addition, a sensitivity analysis based on the Sobol' method is performed to identify the most important factors explaining this uncertainty. Results show that CRNS soil moisture compares well to the soil moisture network when these point-scale values are weighted to account for the spatial sensitivity of the signal and other sources of hydrogen (lattice water and organic carbon) are added to the water content. However, the performance decreases when CRNS is considered as a stand-alone method to retrieve the actual (non-weighted) volumetric soil moisture. The support volume (penetration depth and radius) shows also a considerable uncertainty, especially in relatively dry soil moisture conditions. Four of the seven factors analyzed (the vertical soil moisture profile, bulk density, incoming neutron correction and the calibrated parameter N o ) were found to play an important role. Among the possible improvements identified, a simple correction factor based on vertical point-scale soil moisture profiles shows to be a promising approach to account for the sensitivity of the CRNS signal to the upper soil layers.},

Soil moisture sensors (SMSs) have been used to monitor soil water content (SWC) in crop fields for a long time; however, there is no generally accepted guideline for determining optimal number and placement of soil moisture sensors in the soil profile. In order to study adequate positioning for the installation of soil moisture sensors in the soil profile, six years of field experiments were carried out in North China Plain (NCP). Soil water content was measured using the gravimetric method every 7 to 10 days during six growing seasons of winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L), and root distribution was measured using a soil core method during the key periods of winter wheat growth. The results from the experimental data analysis show that SWC at different depths had a high linear correlation. In addition, the values of correlation coefficients decreased with increasing soil depth; the coefficient of variation (CV) of SWC was higher in the surface layers than in the deeper layers (depths were 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm during the early, middle, and last stages of winter wheat, respectively); wheat roots were mainly distributed in the surface layer. According to an analysis of CV for SWC and root distribution, the depths of planned wetted layers were determined to be 0-40 cm, 0-60 cm, and 0-100 cm during the sowing to reviving stages (the early stage of winter wheat), returning green and jointing stages (the middle stage of winter wheat), and heading to maturity stage (the last stage of winter wheat), respectively. The correlation and R-cluster analyses of SWC at different layers in the soil profile showed that SMSs should be installed 10 and 30 cm below the soil surface during the winter wheat growing season. The linear regression model can be built using SWC at depths of 10 and 30 cm to predict total average SWC in the soil profile. The results of validation showed that the developed model provided reliable estimates of total average SWC in the planned wetted layer. In brief, this study suggests that suitable positioning of soil moisture sensors is at depths of 10 and 30 cm below the soil surface.},

In this study we present a quick and inexpensive supplementary field method for classifying soil wetness in wet environments. The seven wetness classes are based on qualitative indicators, which one can touch, hear or see on the soil surface. To counter critics that such qualitative methods are considerably affected by subjectivity, we performed systematic testing of the method by taking qualitative measurements in the field with 20 non-expert raters. We then analyzed these in terms of degree of agreement and assessed the results against gravimetric sampling and time domain reflectometry measurements. In 70\% of all classifications raters agreed on the wetness class assigned to the marked sampling locations and in 95\% they were not off by more than one wetness class. The seven quantitative wetness classes agreed with gravimetric and time domain reflectometry measurements, although intermediate to wet classes showed an overlap of their range whereas the driest classes showed considerable spread. Despite some potential to optimize the method, it has been shown to be a reliable supplement to existing quantitative techniques for assessing soil moisture patterns in wet environments.

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in land-atmosphere interactions. It is an important geophysical parameter in research on climate, hydrology, agriculture, and forestry. Soil moisture has important climatic effects by influencing ground evapotranspiration, runoff, surface reflectivity, surface emissivity, surface sensible heat and latent heat flux. At the global scale, the extent of its influence on the atmosphere is second only to that of sea surface temperature. At the terrestrial scale, its influence is even greater than that of sea surface temperatures. This paper presents a China Land Soil Moisture Data Assimilation System (CLSMDAS) based on EnKF and land process models, and results of the application of this system in the China Land Soil Moisture Data Assimilation tests. CLSMDAS is comprised of the following components: 1) A land process model-Community Land Model Version 3.0 (CLM3.0)-developed by the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR); 2) Precipitation of atmospheric forcing data and surface-incident solar radiation data come from hourly outputs of the FY2 geostationary meteorological satellite; 3) EnKF (Ensemble Kalman Filter) land data assimilation method; and 4) Observation data including satellite-inverted soil moisture outputs of the AMSR-E satellite and soil moisture observation data. Results of soil moisture assimilation tests from June to September 2006 were analyzed with CLSMDAS. Both simulation and assimilation results of the land model reflected reasonably the temporal-spatial distribution of soil moisture. The assimilated soil moisture distribution matches very well with severe summer droughts in Chongqing and Sichuan Province in August 2006, the worst since the foundation of the People's Republic of China in 1949. It also matches drought regions that occurred in eastern Hubei and southern Guangxi in September.},

	doi = {10.1002/2015WR018095},
	abstract = {In this new era of remote-sensing based hydrology, a major unanswered question is how to incorporate the impact of land-surface based heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics at remote sensing scales. The answer to this question is complicated since (1) soil moisture dynamics that vary with support, extent, and spacing scales are dependent on land-surface based heterogeneity and (2) land-surface based heterogeneity itself is scale-specific and varies with hydroclimates. Land-surface factors such as soil, vegetation, and topography affect soil moisture dynamics by redistributing the available soil moisture on the ground. In this study, we determined the contribution of these biophysical factors to redistribution of near-surface soil moisture across a range of remote sensing scales varying from an (airborne) remote sensor footprint (1.6 km) to a (satellite) footprint scale (25.6 km). Two-dimensional nondecimated wavelet transform was used to extract the support scale information from the spatial signals of the land-surface and soil moisture variables. The study was conducted in three hydroclimates: humid (Iowa), subhumid (Oklahoma), and semiarid (Arizona). The dominance of soil on soil moisture dynamics typically decreased from airborne to satellite footprint scales whereas the influence of topography and vegetation increased with increasing support scale for all three hydroclimates. The distinct effect of hydroclimate was identifiable in the soil attributes dominating the soil moisture dynamics. The near-surface soil moisture dynamics in Arizona (semiarid) can be attributed more to the clay content which is an effective limiting parameter for evaporation whereas in Oklahoma (humid), sand content (limiting parameter for drainage) was the dominant soil attribute. The findings from this study can provide a deeper understanding of the impact of heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics and the potential improvement of hydrological models operating at footprints' scales.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of multivariate analysis to increase the performance and reliability of a novel method for a non-invasive sensing approach for measuring gravimetric soil moisture. Unlike time and frequency domain spectrometers, as well as impedance sensors, where probes should be inserted into the terrain, the proposed approach simply uses a waveguide faced to the soil surface. An open-ended waveguide spectrometer system was developed to acquire “gain” and “phase” spectra, related to received and transmitted signals, in the 1.5-2.7 GHz range from river sand, lightweight expanded clay aggregate (LECA) and silty clay loam soil samples. For each soil type, predictive models of the moisture (\%) were obtained and discussed by using multivariate tools (Principal Component Analysis, Partial Least Square Regression and N-dimensional Partial Least Square Regression). The potentiality of the measurement technique was explored for both non-layered (homogeneous moisture) and layered (two layers with different, homogeneous moisture) soils. In validation tests, R2 values up to 0.989 (RMSE=0.8\%, river sand gain) were observed for single layer test. For double layer test, R2 values up to 0.977 (RMSE=1.4\%, LECA gain, top layer) and 0.962 (RMSE=1.9\%, LECA gain, bottom layer) were obtained. A better accuracy was achieved with N-PLS combining “gain” and “phase” spectra: R-2 values increase up to 0.991 (RMSE=0.9\%, LECA samples). The measurement results demonstrate that the noninvasive waveguide-based spectrometry together with the multivariate analysis is able to assess different moisture contents, with a high level of accuracy, both for non-layered and layered samples of soil with homogenous moisture.

The two main variables used in the Triangle method, that is, land-surface temperature (LST) and vegetation cover, were downscaled and calculated at 100 m spatial resolution. LSTs were downscaled applying the Wavelet-Artificial Intelligence Fusion Approach (WAIFA) on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat imageries. Vegetation fractions were also estimated at 100 m spatial resolution using linear spectral unmixing and Wavelet-AI models. Vegetation indices (VIs) were replaced with the vegetation fractions obtained from sub-pixel classification in the T-s-VI triangle space. The downscaled data were then used for calculating the evaporative fraction (EF), temperature-vegetation-dryness index (TVDI), vegetation temperature condition index (VTCI), and temperature-vegetation index (TVX) at 100 m spatial resolution. Thereafter, surface SM modelling was performed using a combination of Particle Swarm Optimization with Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (PSO-ANFIS) and Support Vector Regression (PSO-SVR) modelling approaches. Results showed that the best input data set to estimate SM includes EF, TVDI, T-s, F-vegetation, F-soil, temperature (T), precipitation at time t(P-t, Pt-1, Pt-2), and irrigation (I). It was also confirmed that PSO-SVR outperformed the PSO-ANFIS modelling approach and could estimate SM with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.93 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.29 at 100 spatial resolution. Range of error was limited between-2.64\% and 2.8\%. It was also shown that the method proposed by Tang et al., (2010) improved the final SM estimations.},

Because UAVs have higher spatial and temporal resolution than satellites, they are currently becoming more useful in remote sensing areas. We developed a water content estimation equation using the color of the soil and suggested a calibration method for field application. Since the resolution of the images taken by the UAV is different according to the altitude, the water content estimation formula is developed by using the images taken at each altitude. In order to calibrate the color difference according to lighting conditions, the calibration method using field data were proposed. The results of the study showed an altitude-specific estimation equation using RGB values of the UAV image through linear regression. The appropriate number of field data needed for calibration for site application of the estimation equation was found between 4 and 10. On-site application results of the proposed calibration method showed RMSE accuracy of 1.8 to 2.9\%.

	abstract = {In the Gurbantunggut Desert, snowmelt-induced high soil water contents briefly create favorable conditions for the germination and growth of plants every spring. Monitoring the rapidly changing conditions in this time period demands fast and efficient methods for measuring soil water contents at the field scale. For this study, a series of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) measurements were carried out on sites characterized by semi-vegetated dunes both in April 2010 and 2011. We compare water contents calculated from the GPR direct ground wave signal to both point scale validation measurements by time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and gravimetric sampling. Our results show that GPR is an effective method to rapidly obtain a detailed image of the field scale soil water content distribution in the Gurbantunggut Desert with an accuracy similar to TDR. Observed large scale soil water content variations are dominated by dune topography: During snow melting, melt water was found to trickle slowly from the dune ridges to interdune valleys, increasing the soil water content there while the dune ridges quickly started to dry down. In dune valleys, smaller scale near-surface soil water content changes were dominated by variations in the vegetation coverage, leading to snowmelt funnels at distinct locations: The snowmelt initially occurred around the stems and branches of plants, forming funnel-shaped melt water induced holes through the snow cover and leading to an increasing amount of melt water collected around these plant roots. Our comparison of data from 2010 to 2011 furthermore suggests a temporally stable distribution of near-surface soil water content. This has important ecological significance for controlling desertification and for restoring and reconstructing vegetation in the Gurbantunggut Desert.},

In this study, the dataset measured in SMAPVEX12 was used as the input data of the backpropagation (BP) neural network to analyze the potential of different data sources or combination of data sources in the research of soil moisture inversion. By the analysis and comparison of the results, some valuable conclusions have been obtained: (1) passive microwave data has a stronger and more direct connection with the near-surface soil moisture (top 0 similar to 6 cm) than the active microwave sensing (radar backscatter coefficient) does, because the active microwave is more sensitive to the confounding effects of vegetation and surface roughness. (2) For the active microwave data, some combination form of the horizontal transmit and horizontal receive (HH) and vertical transmit and horizontal receive (VH) is a more rational selection than only HH to serve as one of the independent information sources for extracting the soil moisture. (3) The optical vegetation information provides the rich vegetation information that is indispensable for the microwave remote sensing data, especially for passive remote sensing, to extract the soil moisture with the average correlation coefficient increased by more than 0.05, at least, when adding the optical vegetation data. (4) Two kinds of forms of the optical vegetation information, either Vegetation Water Content (VWC) or Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), show no obvious differences to provide as auxiliary information for microwave remote sensing data in extracting soil moisture.},

Our objectives were to calibrate and validate a COSMOS rover for mapping 0- to 5-cm soil moisture at spatial scales suitable for evaluating satellite-based soil moisture estimates. Region-specific calibrations for the COSMOS rover were developed using field-average soil moisture measured using impedance probes and the oven-drying method on volumetric samples. The resulting calibrations were applied to map soil moisture on two dates in a 16- by 10-km region around the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (MOISST) in north central Oklahoma and one date in a 34- by 14-km region in the Little Washita River watershed in southwestern Oklahoma. The mapped soil moisture patterns were consistent with the regional spatial variability in surface soil texture and with soil wetting by an intervening rainfall. The rover measured field-average soil moisture with a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3) relative to impedance probes. Likewise, the regional-average 0- to 5-cm soil moisture determined by the rover was within +/- 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3) of the best available independent estimates for each region. These results demonstrate that a COSMOS rover can be used effectively for 0- to 5-cm soil moisture mapping and for determining the average soil moisture at spatial scales suitable for satellite calibration and validation.},

	abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) is a crucial variable in the thermal infrared research and is the major control for land surface hydrological processes at the watershed scale. Estimating the surface SWC from remotely sensed data using the triangle method proposed by Price has been demonstrated in previous studies. In this study, a new soil moisture index (Temperature Rising Rate Vegetation Dryness IndexTRRVDI) is proposed based on a triangle constructed using the mid-morning land surface temperature (LST) rising rate and the vegetation index to estimate the regional SWC. The temperature at the dry edge of the triangle is determined by the surface energy balance principle. The temperature at the wet edge is assumed to be equal to the air temperature. The mid-morning land surface temperature rising rate is calculated using Meteosat Second GenerationSpinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (MSG-SEVIRI) LST products over 4 cloud-free days (day of year: 206, 211, 212, 242) in 2007. The developed TRRVDI is validated by in situ measurements from 19 meteorological stations in Spain. The results indicate that the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the TRRVDI derived using the theoretical limiting edges and the in situ SWC measurements is greater than that derived using the observed limiting edges. The R-2 values are 0.46 and 0.32; respectively (p {\textless} 0.05). Additionally, the TRRVDI is much better than the soil moisture index that was developed using one-time LST and fractional vegetation cover (FVC) with the theoretically determined limiting edges.},

In these studies, the phase is understood to directly relate to the radial component of the physical deformation of the surface. In this paper, however, we use a novel combination of microwave and optical laboratory measurements to demonstrate the presence of persistent and coherent phase changes in a temporal sequence of DInSAR images, related solely to moisture change in a soil. This is confirmation of recent reports suggesting that, in some circumstances, the DInSAR signal may include a significant soil moisture signal. Laboratory measurements were used to obtain a set of high-resolution C-band DInSAR images of a sandy soil sample of an area of 2.0 m x 1.8 m and a depth of 0.2 m, with the fractional volumetric water content varying between 0.1 and 0.4. To independently monitor the soil surface for physical movement, a time-lapsed set of high-resolution digital optical images was continuously acquired. Although the soil underwent a large moisture change, the soil surface was static to within +/-0.1 mm over the majority of the experiment. The DInSAR sequence displayed dynamic and complex variations of the phase, although a linear relationship with moisture change was evident when the mean phase change was considered. The work raises the possibility that DInSAR could be used for the monitoring of soil moisture change in a scene, a parameter of significant economic and environmental importance.},

	abstract = {At the watershed scale, soil moisture is the major control for rainfall-runoff response, especially where saturation excess runoff processes dominate. From the ecological point of view, the pools of soil moisture are fundamental ecosystem resources providing the transpirable water for plants. In drylands particularly, soil moisture is one of the major controls on the structure, function, and diversity in ecosystems. In terms of the global hydrological cycle, the overall quantity of soil moisture is small, similar to 0.05\%; however, its importance to the global energy balance and the distribution of precipitation far outweighs its physical amount. In soils it governs microbial activity that affects important biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and CO2 production via respiration. During the past 20 years, technology has advanced considerably, with the development of different electrical sensors for determining soil moisture at a point. However, modeling of watersheds requires areal averages. As a result, point measurements and modeling grid cell data requirements are generally incommensurate. We review advances in sensor technology, particularly emerging geophysical methods and distributed sensors, aimed at bridging this gap. We consider some of the data analysis methods for upscaling from a point to give an areal average. Finally, we conclude by offering a vision for future research, listing many of the current scientific and technical challenges.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a multi-sensor remote sensing study of physically crusted soil with various moisture contents by using millimetre-wave backscatter radiation. The backscattered radiation was used to generate an empirical model to estimate soil moisture at the thin surface crust scale by using a set of soils with known moisture content as a reference. The model was then used to assess the moisture content of a new set of soils from the same group. Real-time measurement of soil moisture in the top layer beneath the soil crust is impractical at best and impossible using traditional methods. The proposed method, therefore, paves the way to assessing soil moisture content immediately beneath the surface crust as well as in a micro-profile at depths of 0-3 cm. It can be combined with other active and passive remote sensing methods to provide a micro-profile measurement of soil moisture to the depth of the entire upper root zone (0-30 cm) and of the plough layer (0-20 cm) under undisturbed conditions. The method is based on the emerging technology of millimetre waves, which provide improved spatial resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Further development and use of the method described herein will make it simple and practical to analyse and understand the processes governing the soil-water interface. The major processes for which this information is important are soil crusting, water budgets (infiltration, runoff and evaporation) and soil erosion.},

	abstract = {Quantification of groundwater recharge is essential for water resources management. The water balance method is one of several methods for measuring event-based groundwater recharge. Soil moisture measurement data are essential for quantifying recharge using the water balance method. The spacing and zone of influence of soil moisture sensors used in a study are important factors for the accuracy of recharge calculations. A large lysimeter was used to measure the water balance components to quantify groundwater recharge in South Florida as a function of soil moisture and water table levels. Recharge was calculated using sensor spacings of 10 and 20 cm and zone of influence of 10 and 20 cm for seven major rainfall events. Recharge calculated with a sensor spacing of 20 cm had a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 33.1\% as compared with the 10-cm spacing. Recharge calculated using a zone of influence of 20 cm had an RRMSE of 38.8\% as compared with the 10-cm zone of influence. This error is attributed to soil moisture tensor discretization, which results in averaging the soil moisture in a soil layer containing the saturated and unsaturated zones interface, which leads to an overestimation of soil moisture in the unsaturated zone and an underestimation of soil moisture in the saturated zone. Vertical spacing of sensors larger than the `sensors' zone of influence also gives erroneous results as portions of the soil profile are not measured. For groundwater recharge calculations, selecting a sensor with suitable zone of influence and appropriate sensor spacing can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the calculations.},

	abstract = {Ground-penetrating radar is a fast noninvasive technique that can monitor subsurface structure and water-content distribution. To interpret traveltime information from single common-offset measurements, additional assumptions, such as constant permittivity, usually are required. We present a fast ground-penetrating-radar measurement technique using a multiple transmitter-and-receiver setup to measure simultaneously the reflector depth and average soil-water content. It can be considered a moving minicommon-midpoint measurement. For a simple analysis, we use a straightforward evaluation procedure that includes two traveltimes to the same reflector, obtained from different antenna separations. For a more accurate approach, an inverse evaluation procedure is added, using traveltimes obtained from all antenna separations at one position and its neighboring measurement locations. The evaluation of a synthetic data set with a lateral variability in reflector depth and an experimental example with a large variability in soil-water content are introduced to demonstrate the applicability for field-scale measurements. The crucial point for this application is the access to absolute traveltimes, which are difficult to determine accurately from common-offset measurements.},

The 10HS sensor is one of the most recent developments in capacitance sensors. However, up to now, little is known about the accuracy of this sensor, and the dependency of its measurements on soil type and environmental factors. In this study, the performance of the 10HS sensor was investigated through experiments using liquids with known dielectric properties and experiments in a set of porous media exhibiting a wide range of properties. The response of the 10HS sensor in bilayered systems was also investigated. The experimental results suggested that there is a distinct instrument sensitivity to soil type, indicating the need for individual soil calibration. A set of specific calibration equations for the various porous materials studied were proposed. It was shown that the 10HS sensor is able to provide reasonably accurate relative permittivity (epsilon(r)) measurements, but the manufacturer's epsilon(r) calibration equation, to some extent, overestimates epsilon(r) in the full range of the measured values in liquids. The sensor to sensor variability was also found to be relatively small. It was shown that the manufacturer's calibration equation for measuring. Version 1 underestimates., whereas Version 3 overestimates., in all porous materials examined. The most accurate results were provided by the proposed soil-specific calibration equations obtained using the multipoint calibration equations. However, the two-point calibration equations reasonably represent. in all porous media tested. Underestimation of soil moisture with increasing temperature in coarse porous media and overestimation in fine porous media were observed. The temperature dependence was more important in the fine porous media. The effect of electrical conductivities in sand was also examined, and it was found to be negligible. Finally, the sensors' response in bilayered systems generally follows the refractive averaging scheme at lower epsilon(r) values and the arithmetic averaging scheme at higher epsilon(r) values.

Compared to potable water (PW), reclaimed water (RW) may contain more salts, which can modify the dielectric permittivity of the soil and, hence, alter the readings of SMSs when measuring the soil water content. The main objectives of this experiment were to evaluate the functionality of four SMS brands and to quantify potential irrigation savings. Secondary objectives were to analyze the behavior consistency of three units within a brand to control irrigation, and to compare the brands. The experiment was carried out in Gainesville, Florida, under turfgrass plots irrigated with PW in 2009 and RW with an average salinity of 0.75 dS/m during 2010. Four SMS brands (Acclima, AquaSpy, Baseline, and Dynamax) were selected and compared to a treatment without sensor feedback (WOS). Even though replicates of AquaSpy were statistically different under both PW and RW, all SMSs tested applied significantly less water than WOS. Water savings ranged 46\%- 78\% under PW, and 45\%- 68\% under RW. Therefore, SMSs can be a useful tool for conserving water on turfgrass irrigated with either PW or RW.},

	abstract = {Frequency Domain Analysis is a well established technique in soil moisture determination, using the change in electrical capacitance of probes inserted into the soil caused by the presence of water. However it is known that temperature affects the determination of this capacitance. Here two different techniques are used, the first passing a fixed frequency through the soil via insulated probes, then measuring the amplitude of the resultant signal. The second uses the soil capacitance as the controlling component in a variable frequency oscillator, measuring the resultant times to charge and discharge. The measured capacitance is seen to be affected both by the temperature of the soil and, due to the sensitive nature of the monitoring electronics, also the temperature of critical components in the measurement circuits. Results from these experiments show that these two effects are complementary, soil temperature adding to the measured capacitance, whilst electronics temperature effectively decreases the measured capacitance. The daily profiles of the soil and electronics temperatures, whilst both rising during the day, and falling at night, show significant phase difference and therefore do not simply cancel out. Further, the strength of temperature compensation required is shown to vary with technique and moisture level. This paper explores these phenomena using results from a recently developed, four probe Frequency Domain capacitance based sensor costing around 12 Euros. These measurements are compared to those achieved by a commercial soil moisture system costing over 250 times this price. Preliminary results are presented from temperature compensation algorithms intended to minimize these effects. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CANS), which estimates field scale soil water content, bridges the gap between point measurement and remote sensing. The accuracy of CRNS measurements, however, is affected by additional hydrogen pools (e.g., vegetation, snow, and rainfall interception). The objectives of this study are to: (i) evaluate the accuracy of CRNS estimates in a farmland system using depth and horizontal weighted point measurements, (ii) introduce a novel method for estimating the amounts of hydrogen from biomass and snow cover in CRNS data, and (iii) propose a simple approach for correcting the influences of aboveground hydrogen pool (expressed as aboveground water equivalent, AWE) on CRNS measurements. A field experiment was conducted in northeast China to compare soil water content results from CANS to in-situ data with time domain reflectometry (TDR) and neutron probe (NP) in the 0-40 cm soil layers. The biomass water equivalent (BWE) and snow water equivalent (SWE) were observed to have separate linear relationships with the thermal fast neutron ratio, and the dynamics of BWE and SWE were estimated correctly in the crop seasons and snow-covered seasons, respectively. A simple approach, which considered the AWE, AWE at calibration, and the effective measurement depth of CRNS, was introduced to correct the errors caused by BWE and SWE. After correction, the correlation coefficients between soil water contents determined by CRNS and TDR were 0.79 and 0.77 during the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons, respectively, and CRNS measurements had RMSEs of 0.028, 0.030, and 0.039 m(3) m(-3) in the 2014 and 2015 crop seasons and the snow-covered seasons, respectively. The experimental results also indicated that the accuracies of CRNS estimated BWE and SWE were affected by the distributions of aboveground hydrogen pools, which were related to the height of the CRNS device above ground surface.

To predict Db as functions of the measurements of CI and theta, a variety of semi-empirical CI-models have been established historically, however a study for validating these models has not been found. In this study four CI-models, one considered the penetration depth as variable but others did not, were evaluated under laboratory condition. The methodology was to use our own developed dual-sensor vertical penetrometer (DSVP) to simultaneously measure Cl and volumetric soil water content (9,), and then to compare the bulk density (Db) core-measured to that model-predicted by the DSVP data. Two types of soil samples (silt-loam and clay) were tested. Because a previous study speculated that penetration depth could confound the CI measured, two depth-dependent factors were incorporated into each CI-model for validating this speculation. Our study found that two of the four models tested fit the experimental data with acceptable R-2 ({\textgreater} 0.70) and RMSE ({\textless} 0.093 g cm-(3)). In contrast, the experimental results confirmed that CI in Model-1 had a peak value adapting a wide range of a More ever, the results indicated that the DSVP combined with Model-1 or Model-2 can be used as a tool to predict Db when CI and 9 are simultaneously measured.

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture (SSM) content plays an important role in a number of physical processes involving the energy and mass exchanges between the land and atmosphere interactions. Determination of spatially complete SSM in regional scale has long been one of the most significant tasks in remote-sensing community. Although with limited penetrating ability comparing to microwave missions, optical/thermal infrared sensors can provide surface observations at finer spatial resolution. On the basis of a recently developed approach for deriving all-weather SSM content from satellite images, the present study investigates an optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system for mapping finer spatial resolution all-weather soil moisture content in China from the combined use of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) meteorological products. A preliminary evaluation of the all-weather SSM retrieval is implemented with field SSM measurements at 461 sites across China. Results show that the root mean square error (RMSE) varies from 0.053 to 0.070m(3) m(-3) with an average RMSE of 0.063m(3) m(-3) and an average bias of -0.018m(3) m(-3) obtained on the six selected days from April to September. These first results of all-weather SSM retrieval indicate that the optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system has a promising perspective for mapping SSM with currently available satellite and meteorological products in regional scale. Finally, two practical recommendations with respective to improve the system inputs for producing more reliable SSM products are summarized for further developments of the optical/thermal remote-sensing-based operational system.},

	abstract = {This study aims at stimulating the development of soil moisture data assimilation systems in a direction where they can provide both the necessary control of slow drift in operational NWP applications and support the physical insight in the performance of the land surface component. It addresses four topics concerning the systematic nature of soil moisture data assimilation experiments over Europe during the growing season of 2000 involving the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model infrastructure. In the first topic the effect of the (spinup related) bias in 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40) precipitation on the data assimilation is analyzed. From results averaged over 36 European locations, it appears that about half of the soil moisture increments in the 2000 growing season are attributable to the precipitation bias. A second topic considers a new soil moisture data assimilation system, demonstrated in a coupled single-column model (SCM) setup, where precipitation and radiation are derived from observations instead of from atmospheric model fields. For many of the considered locations in this new system, the accumulated soil moisture increments still exceed the interannual variability estimated from a multiyear offline land surface model run. A third topic examines the soil water budget in response to these svstematic increments. For a number of Mediterranean locations the increments successfully increase the surface evaporation, as is expected from the fact that atmospheric moisture deficit information is the key driver of soil moisture adjustment. In many other locations, however, evaporation is constrained by the experimental SCM setup and is hardly affected by the data assimilation. Instead, a major portion of the increments eventually leave the soil as runoff. In the fourth topic observed evaporation is used to evaluate the impact of the data assimilation on the forecast quality. In most cases, the difference between the control and data assimilation runs is considerably smaller than the (positive) difference between any of the simulations and the observations.},

In this study, an adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) method is used to simulate SWC in the extreme arid area. In-situ SWC datasets for soil layers, with depths of 40 cm (layer 1), 60 cm (layer 2) below surface was taken for the present study. The models analyzed different combinations of antecedent SWC values and the appropriate input vector has been selected based on the analysis of residuals. The performance of the ANFIS models in training and validation sets are compared with the observed data. In layer 1, the model which consists of six antecedent values of SWC, has been selected as the best fit model for SWC modeling. On the other hand, which includes two antecedent values of SWC, has been selected as the best fit model for SWC modeling at layer 2. In order to assess the ability of ANFIS model relative to that of the ANN model, the best fit of ANFIS model of layer 1 and layer 2 structures are also tested by two artificial neural networks (ANN), namely, Levenberg-Marquardt feedforward neural network (ANN-1) and Bayesian regularization feedforward neural network (ANN-2). The comparison was made according to the various statistical measures. A detailed comparison of the overall performance indicated that the ANFIS model performed better than both the ANN-1 and ANN-2 in SWC modeling for the validation data sets in this study.

It is therefore necessary to verify any such data to have a better guide to their usage. In this study, we have compared satellite soil moisture retrievals of the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I), with ERA-Interim/Land and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS-1) soil moisture products over the Tibetan Plateau. They are found to be largely different from each other regarding the soil moisture magnitudes in spring, summer and autumn, with those of the ERA-Interim/Land particularly higher than the other datasets in the eastern plateau. The SSM/I and the ERA-Interim/Land data are in good agreement considering their seasonal dynamics, which are however considerably different from the GLDAS-1 models (CLM, Noah, Mosaic and VIC). For interannual variations, it is striking to find strong negative correlations (R {\textless} -0.6) between the SSM/I and the ERA-Interim/Land data in spring and autumn, especially over the central plateau. The SSM/I data is found to have also strong negative correlations (R {\textless} -0.4) with data of the four GLDAS-1 models in the eastern plateau in spring; and such negative correlations appear in central and western plateau in autumn. In summer, the SSM/I data appears to be positively correlated with the ERA-Interim/Land and all the GLDAS-1 data over the plateau. The negative correlations indicate these data have quite different temporal dynamics for their interannual variations, especially in spring and autumn. A look at the spatial variations revealed that the SSM/I data shows a north-south seesaw pattern in all seasons. The GLDAS-1 Mosaic, Noah and CLM data are able to represent this seesaw pattern principally, which however, can hardly be seen in the ERA-Interim/Land and the GLDAS-1 VIC data. Our results have indicated significant uncertainties in the soil moisture data from remote sensing and reanalysis sources; and we have to use such data with great care.},

Currently, there are three methods of estimating soil moisture: ground-based (in-situ) measurements; remote sensing based methods and land surface models. In recent years, the cosmic ray probe (CRP), which is an in-situ technique, has been implemented in several countries across the globe. The CRP provides area-averaged soil moisture at an intermediate scale and thus bridges the gap between in-situ point measurements and global satellite-based soil moisture estimates. The aim of this study was to test the suitability of the CRP to provide spatial estimates of soil moisture. The CRP was set up and calibrated in Cathedral Peak Catchment VI. An in-situ soil moisture network consisting of time-domain reflectometry and Echo probes was created in Catchment VI, and was used to validate the CRP soil moisture estimates. Once calibrated, the CRP was found to provide spatial estimates of soil moisture, which correlated well with the in-situ soil moisture network data set and yielded an R-2 value of 0.845. The use of the CRP for soil moisture monitoring provided reliable, accurate and continuous soil moisture estimates over the catchment area.

	abstract = {At global scale nutrient flows are unbalanced, resulting in huge surpluses in Western Europe versus negative balances in Africa. Existing policy and socio-economic environments in different parts of the world are the major cause of this situation. At lower spatial scales, a much more complex and diverse picture emerges. In Sub-Saharan Africa, different levels and causes of soil fertility decline are found among agro-ecological zones, soil types, farm systems, wealth groups, urban-rural households, cash and food crops, home fields and bush fields. Technology development has been the traditional response to address nutrient imbalances in general, and soil fertility decline in Africa in particular. Farm households have continued to develop and adapt existing technology to changing situations. National and international research institutions have followed a variety of changing approaches of which the recently developed participatory approaches have yielded some impressive results in isolated cases. These efforts have, however, not led to the necessary massive reversion of the trend in soil fertility decline. The Dutch policies on nutrient use and the Indonesian policy to adopt Integrated Pest Management are two examples, associated with such major trend reversions. This suggests that promoting and supporting participatory technologies have limited impact when no attention is paid to participatory policy development and implementation. In order to mobilise farm households in a trend reversion, a number of conditions should be met such as stable prices for agricultural outputs, better input/output prices ratios, influence of land users on the research agenda and private-public initiatives focused on smallholders. This observation calls for the establishment of interactive landusers-science-policy triangles at various scales (local, national and international) in which joint learning and mediating may lead to more informed decision making, more focused design of an agricultural sector policy, implementation of policies by effective institutions, and appropriate technology development and implementation. Interventions need to be reoriented: less technology development, more policy influence and institution building. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron probes are widely used to monitor environmental water content near the surface. The method averages over tens of hectares and is unrivaled in serving representative data for agriculture and hydrological models at the hectometer scale. Recent experiments, however, indicate that the sensor response to environmental heterogeneity is not fully understood. Knowledge of the support volume is a prerequisite for the proper interpretation and validation of hydrogeophysical data. In a previous study, several physical simplifications have been introduced into a neutron transport model in order to derive the characteristics of the cosmic-ray probe's footprint. We utilize a refined source and energy spectrum for cosmic-ray neutrons and simulate their response to a variety of environmental conditions. Results indicate that the method is particularly sensitive to soil moisture in the first tens of meters around the probe, whereas the radial weights are changing dynamically with ambient water. The footprint radius ranges from 130 to 240 m depending on air humidity, soil moisture, and vegetation. The moisture-dependent penetration depth of 15 to 83 cm decreases exponentially with distance to the sensor. However, the footprint circle remains almost isotropic in complex terrain with nearby rivers, roads or hill slopes. Our findings suggest that a dynamically weighted average of point measurements is essential for accurate calibration and validation. The new insights will have important impact on signal interpretation, sensor installation, data interpolation from mobile surveys, and the choice of appropriate resolutions for data assimilation into hydrological models.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays a fundamental role in the mass and energy balance between the land surface and the atmosphere, making its knowledge essential for several hydrological and climatic applications. The aim of this study is to extend the current knowledge of soil moisture spatial-temporal variability at the catchment scale (up to 500 km(2)). The main implication is to provide guidelines to obtain soil moisture values representative of the mean behaviour at the medium-sized river basin scale, which is useful for remote sensing validation analysis and rainfall-runoff modeling. To this end, 23 measurements campaigns were carried out during a time span of 14 months at 20 sites located within the Upper Chiascio River Basin, a catchment with a drainage area of about 460 km(2) in the Umbria Region (central Italy). The data set allowed the analysis of both soil moisture temporal stability and its dynamics. On the basis of statistical and temporal stability approaches, it was investigated how factors such as climatic regime and geomorphology influence soil moisture behaviour. For the investigated area, the spatial variability of soil moisture was higher in dry periods with respect to wet periods, mainly due to the rainfall pattern characteristics during different periods of the year. Soil moisture values recorded during wet periods showed a better correlation than those recorded during dry periods. The maximum number of required samples, to obtain the mean areal soil moisture with an absolute error of 3\% vol/vol, was found equal to 12. The temporal stability analysis showed that during wet periods just one “optimal” measurement point can provide values of soil moisture representative of the catchment-mean behaviour, while during dry periods the number of “optimal” measurement points became equal to two. Therefore, at the adopted spatial scale the use of a single measurement point can lead to significant errors. From the perspective of soil moisture dynamics, the decomposition of the spatial variance showed that the contribution of the time-invariant component (temporal mean of each site) was predominant on respect to the total spatial variance of absolute soil moisture data, for almost the whole observation period. Results provided guidance to optimize soil moisture sampling by performing targeted measurements at a few selected points representative of the catchment-mean behaviour.},

Remote sensing and modeling are expected to provide hydrometeorological data needed for these process studies, but in situ observations are required to support their calibration and validation. For this purpose, we have established a dense monitoring network on the central Tibetan Plateau to measure two state variables (soil moisture and temperature) at three spatial scales (1.0 degrees, 0.3 degrees, and 0.1 degrees) and four soil depths (0-5, 10, 20, and 40 cm). The experimental area is characterized by low biomass, high soil moisture dynamic range, and typical freeze-thaw cycle. The network consists of 56 stations with their elevation varying over 4470-4950 m. As auxiliary parameters of this network, soil texture and soil organic carbon content are measured at each station to support further studies. To guarantee continuous and high-quality data, tremendous efforts have been made to protect the data-logger from soil water intrusion, to calibrate soil moisture sensors, and to upscale the point measurements. As the highest soil moisture network above sea level in the world, our network meets the requirement for evaluating a variety of soil moisture products and for soil moisture scaling analyses. It also directly contributes to the soil-water-ice-air-ecosystem interaction studies on the third pole. The data will be publicized via the International Soil Moisture Network and the recent 2-yr data will become accessible soon.},

We use three main data sources: in situ observations, the remote-sensing-based data set of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative on the Essential Climate Variable soil moisture (ECV-SM), and land surface model estimates from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts's ERA-Land. The intercomparisons of the three soil moisture data sources are performed at the in situ locations as well as for the full-gridded products. The applied method allows us to quantify the spatial footprint of soil moisture. At the in situ locations it is shown that for absolute soil moisture the ECV-SM and ERA-Land products perform similarly, while for the temporal anomalies the ECV-SM product shows more similarity in spatial representativeness with the in situ data. When taking into account all grid cells of the ECV-SM and ERA-Land products to calculate spatial representativeness, we find the largest differences in spatial representativeness for the absolute values. The differences in spatial representativeness between the single products can be related to some of their intrinsic characteristics, i.e., for ECV-SM low similarities are found in topographically complex terrain and areas with dense vegetation, while for ERA-Land the smoothed model topography and surface properties affect soil moisture and its spatial representativeness. Additionally, we show that the applied method is robust and can be used to analyze existing networks to provide insight into the locations in which higher station density would be of most benefit.},

	abstract = {Scaling processes are increasingly understood to be the result of nonlinear dynamic mechanisms repeating scale after scale from large to small scales leading to nonclassical resolution dependencies. This means that the statistical properties systematically vary in strong, power-law ways with the resolution. When present in geophysical and remotely sensed fields, it implies that when classical (single-scale) remote sensing algorithms are used to determine surrogates of various geophysical fields, they can at most be correct at the unique (and subjective) calibration resolution. Scaling analysis and modeling techniques were applied to MODIS TERRA Bands I through 7 and to the standard derived vegetation and soil moisture indices in order to quantitatively characterize the wide range of scaling of these fields, The scaling exponents we found are not so large; however, they act across wide scale ranges and imply large effects. For example, for the statistics near the mean, the MODIS (500-m) resolution would be biased by a factor of similar to 1.52 when compared with similar results from an “ideal” sensor at 1-mm resolution. Applying the standard index algorithms on lower and lower resolution satellite data, we obtained indices with significantly different statistical properties than if the same algorithm was used at the finest resolution and then degraded to an intermediate value (a difference of a factor similar to 1.54). This shows that the algorithms can, at best, be accurate at the unique calibration scale and this points to the need to develop resolution-independent algorithms based on the scaling exponents.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key environmental variable, important to, e.g., farmers, meteorologists, and disaster management units. Here, we present a method to retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) from the Sentinel-1 (S-1) satellites, which carry C-hand Synthetic Aperture Radar (CSAR) sensors that provide the richest freely available SAR data source so far, unprecedented in accuracy and coverage. Our SSM retrieval method, adapting well-established change detection algorithms, builds the first globally deployable soil moisture observation data set with 1-km resolution. This paper provides an algorithm formulation to be operated in data cube architectures and high-performance computing environments. It includes the novel dynamic Gaussian upscaling method for spatial upscaling of SAR imagery, harnessing its field-scale information and successfully mitigating effects from the SAR's high signal complexity. Also, a new regression-based approach for estimating the radar slope is defined, coping with Sentinel-1's inhomogeneity in spatial coverage. We employ the S-1 SSM algorithm on a 3-year S-1 data cube over Italy, obtaining a consistent set of model parameters and product masks, unperturbed by coverage discontinuities. An evaluation of therefrom generated S-1 SSM data, involving a 1-km soil water balance model over Umbria, yields high agreement over plains and agricultural areas, with low agreement over forests and strong topography. While positive biases during the growing season are detected, the excellent capability to capture small-scale soil moisture changes as from rainfall or irrigation is evident. The S-1 SSM is currently in preparation toward operational product dissemination in the Copernicus Global Land Service.},

Like groundwater, soil moisture measurements may not always available in sufficient distributions for effective monitoring of agricultural operations. This paper presents a quasi-terrestrial water balance method, driven by common hydro-climatic data, to estimate soil moisture. The method is tested for the approximate to 152 000 km(2) floodplain region of Hai River Basin using 48 consecutive months (January 2003-December 2006) of data. Comparisons of the estimated and field-measured soil moisture storage and storage change show favorable agreements at monthly, seasonal yearly cycles. This suggests that the proposed method reliably detects soil moisture storage signal in the tested region. The analysis shows a narrowing soil moisture storage change in the study area. Further analysis indicates that the narrowing in soil moisture storage change is sustained by groundwater storage loss via irrigation. There is also storage loss to the atmosphere via irrigation-driven evapotranspiration. Apparently, storage gain occurs in summer while storage loss occurs in winter. However, an overall storage loss exists in the tested floodplain region of Hai River Basin. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

An EF model using the remotely sensed land surface temperature (Ts)/vegetation index concept was modified by incorporating North American Regional Reanalysis (NAAR) Ta data and used for SM estimation. Two different combinations of temperature and vegetation fraction using the difference between Ts from MODIS Aqua and Terra images and Ta from NARR data (Ts-Ta Aqua-day and Ts-Ta Terra-day, respectively) were proposed and the results were compared with those obtained from a previously improved model (Delta Ts Aqua-DayNight) as a reference. For the estimation of SM from EF, two empirical models were tested and discussed to find the most appropriate model for converting MODIS-derived EF data to SM values. Estimated SM values were then correlated with in situ SM measurements and their relationships were statistically analyzed. Results indicated statistically significant correlations between SM estimated from all three EF estimation approaches and field measured SM values (R-2 = 0.42-0.77, p values {\textless} 0.04) exhibiting the possibility to estimate SM from remotely sensed EF models. The proposed Ts-Ta MODIS Aqua-day and Terra-day approaches resulted in better estimations of SM (on average higher R-2 values and similar RMSEs) as compared with the Delta Ts reference approach indicating that the concept of incorporating NARR Ta data into Ts/Vegetation index model improved soil moisture estimation accuracy based on evaporative fraction. The accuracies of the predictions were found to be considerably better for intermediate SM values (from 12 to 22 vol/vol\%) with square errors averaging below 11 (vol/vol\%)(2). This indicates that the model needs further improvements to account for extreme soil moisture conditions. The findings of this research can be potentially used to downscale SM estimations obtained from passive microwave remote sensing techniques.

The SMI is a potentially useful index for calculating the water deficit in the Czech Republic and Central Europe.

There were frequent occurrences of flash drought, defined as a very rapid decline in soil moisture during a 3-week period. The CHMI can use SMI values below -3 in the Integrated Warning Service System. The routine calculation of SMI values can alert agricultural producers to the development of flash drought conditions and provide them with information regarding the effectiveness of recent rainfall events. An increase in soil moisture, in contrast, could serve as a warning sign for hydrology because it creates the preconditions for flooding.

The methodology was explored by means of several applications on soil moisture data coming from field measurement, remote sensing, and hydrological modelling over a wide range of spatial scales. From the relations between the occupation probability in soil moisture spatial patterns and the normalized size of the largest cluster at different scales, as well as the scaling behaviour, it is possible to argue that also for this physical system the critical point theory applies.

This study examines the characteristic length scale, or effective depth Delta z, of a simple active hydrological control volume. The volume is described only by precipitation inputs and soil water dynamics evident in surface-only soil moisture observations. To proceed, first an observation-based technique is presented to estimate the soil moisture loss function based on analysis of soil moisture dry-downs and its successive negative increments. Then, the length scale Delta z is obtained via an optimization process wherein the root-mean-squared (RMS) differences between surface soil moisture observations and its predictions based on water balance are minimized. The process is entirely observation-driven. The surface soil moisture estimates are obtained from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and precipitation from the gauge-corrected Climate Prediction Center daily global precipitation product. The length scale Delta z exhibits a clear east-west gradient across the contiguous United States (CONUS), such that large Delta z depths ({\textgreater}200 mm) are estimated in wetter regions with larger mean precipitation. The median Delta z across CONUS is 135 mm. The spatial variance of Delta z is predominantly explained and influenced by precipitation characteristics.

Filter increments (i.e., discrete additions or subtractions of water suggested by the filter) are then compared to antecedent precipitation errors determined using higher-quality rain gauge observations. A synthetic twin experiment demonstrates that the correlation coefficient between antecedent precipitation errors and filter increments provides an effective proxy for the accuracy of the soil moisture retrievals themselves. Given the inherent difficulty of directly validating remotely sensed soil moisture products using ground-based observations, this assimilation-based proxy provides a valuable tool for efforts to improve soil moisture retrieval strategies and quantify the novel information content of remotely sensed soil moisture retrievals for land surface modeling applications. Using real spaceborne data, the approach is demonstrated for four different remotely sensed soil moisture datasets along two separate transects in the southern United States. Results suggest that the relative superiority of various retrieval strategies varies geographically.},

Like the original method, there is sudden jump in Vo and therefore a quantum jump in computed runoff is possible. In the present study, an attempt is made to develop an expression for Vo to make the model a continuous watershed model. Then, the performance of the new model is compared with the model proposed by Michel et al. and the original SCS-CN model by applying them in a large number of small watersheds in the United States. The present model was found to perform significantly better than both the original SCS-CN model and the model proposed by Michel et al. Copyright (c) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {In a period of surging energy prices, resource depletion, and concerns over the use of nuclear power, energy savings are paramount and a major component of ongoing sustainable development. Geothermal energy is the energy stored in the form of heat beneath the surface of the Earth. Related to this, the thermal properties of soils are of great importance, particularly with regard to the modern trends of utilizing the subsurface for transmission of either heated fluids or high power currents. For example, in geothermal hydrology or geotechnical engineering applications, the thermal conductivity must be determined to assess the energy potential of the soil. The presence of water (groundwater, rainfall, natural moisture) improves both the thermal conductivity and thermal capacity fields. We present an original method-based on a thermal study and the use of non-integer order models-to determine the thermophysical parameters of different soils in near-surface layers, and link them to the water content variations of different soils. The results are compared with those obtained using a capacitive profile probe. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics. [http://dx.doi.org/10.1063/1.4737138]},

The authors present a case study of soil PSD and its relationship with soil-water content (SWC) in a gravel-mulched field in an arid area of northwestern China using a statistical regression model and Pearson correlation coefficients. The SWC was correlated with clay content, and both increased with soil depth, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.901 to 0.972. The regression analysis of clay content and SWC from various depths used the least-squares method, and the predictive accuracies of the regression models were evaluated with the data for measured clay content. Both the mean error and root mean square error were low and the prediction accuracy was high. The SWCs were significantly positively correlated between soil layers, with all correlation coefficients greater than 0.989, indicating that the SWC in a specific layer could be well estimated by the SWC in the adjacent subsoil. Clay content can thus be predicted from measured SWC, and can be further used to evaluate soil quality and productivity. This study also provides a theoretical reference for the prevention of salinization, the adjustment of land use and agricultural production, and the conservation of soil and water.

	abstract = {This research addressed the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture (SM) in a heterogeneous landscape. The research objective was to investigate soil moisture variation in eight homogeneous 30 by 30 m plots, similar to the pixel size of a Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) or Enhanced Thematic Mapper plus (ETM+) image. The plots were adjacent to eight stations of an in situ soil moisture network operated by the United States Department of Agriculture-Agriculture Research Service USDA-ARS in Tifton, GA. We also studied five adjacent agricultural fields to examine the effect of different landuses/land covers (LULC) (grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil) on the temporal and spatial variation of soil moisture. Soil moisture field data were collected on eight occasions throughout 2005 and January 2006 to establish comparisons within and among eight homogeneous plots. Consistently throughout time, analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed high variation in the soil moisture behavior among the plots and high homogeneity in the soil moisture behavior within them. A precipitation analysis for the eight sampling dates throughout the year 2005 showed similar rainfall conditions for the eight study plots. Therefore, soil moisture variation among locations was explained by in situ local conditions. Temporal stability geostatistical analysis showed that soil moisture has high temporal stability within the small plots and that a single point reading can be used to monitor soil moisture status for the plot within a maximum 3\% volume/volume (v/v) soil moisture variation. Similarly, t-statistic analysis showed that soil moisture status in the upper soil layer changes within 24 h. We found statistical differences in the soil moisture between the different LULC in the agricultural fields as well as statistical differences between these fields and the adjacent 30 by 30 m plots. From this analysis, it was demonstrated that spatial proximity is not enough to produce similar soil moisture, since t-test's among adjacent plots with different LULCs showed significant differences. These results confirm that a remote sensing approach that considers homogeneous LULC landscape fragments can be used to identify landscape units of similar soil moisture behavior under heterogeneous landscapes. In addition, the in situ USDA-ARS network wilt serve better in remote sensing studies in which sensors with fine spatial resolution are evaluated. This study is a first step towards identifying landscape units that can be monitored using the single point reading of the USDA-ARS stations network. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Spatial moisture distribution in natural soil or other material is a valuably information for many applications. Standard measurement techniques give only mean or punctual results. Therefore a new inversion algorithm has been developed to derive moisture profiles along single TDR sensor-probes. The algorithm uses the full information content of TDR reflection data measured from one or both sides of an embedded probe. The system consisting of sensor probe and surrounded soil can be interpreted as a nonuniform transmission-line. The algorithm is based on the telegraph equations for nonuniform transmission-lines and an optimization approach to reconstruct the distribution of the capacitance and effective conductance along the transmission-line with high spatial resolution. The capacitance distribution can be converted into permittivity and water content by means of a capacitance model and dielectric mixing rules. Numerical investigations have been carried out to verify the accuracy of the inversion algorithm. Single- and double-sided time-domain reflection data were used to determine the capacitance and effective conductance profiles of lossless and lossy materials. The results show that single-sided reflection data are sufficient for lossless (or low-loss) cases. In case of lossy material two independent reflection measurements are required to reconstruct a reliable capacitance profile. The inclusion of an additional effective conductivity profile leads to an improved capacitance profile. The algorithm converges very fast and yields a capacitance profile within a sufficiently short time. The additional transformation to the water content requires no significant calculation time.},

Such techniques allow fast soil water content measurements helpful in both agricultural and environmental fields. These techniques, based on the theory of heat dissipation, were tested by directly measuring temperature dynamic variation of samples after heating. For the assessment of temperature dynamic variations data were collected during three intervals (3, 6 and 10 s). To account for the presence of specific heats differences between water and soil, the analyses were regulated using slopes to linearly describe their trends. For all analyses, the best model was achieved for a 10 s slope. Three different approaches were considered, two in the laboratory and one in the field. The first laboratory-based one was centred on active infrared thermography, considered measurement of temperature variation as independent variable and reported r = 0.74. The second laboratory-based one was focused on active infrared thermometry, added irradiation as independent variable and reported r = 0.76. The in-field experiment was performed by active infrared thermometry, heating bare soil by solar irradiance after exposure due to primary tillage. Some meteorological parameters were inserted as independent variables in the prediction model, which presented r = 0.61. In order to obtain more general and wide estimations in-field a Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis on three classes of percentage of soil water content was performed obtaining a high correct classification in the test (88.89\%). The prediction error values were lower in the field with respect to laboratory analyses. Both techniques could be used in conjunction with a Geographic Information System for obtaining detailed information on soil heterogeneity.},

Currently, the method is limited to soil samples of 20 g or larger. However, test equipment for much smaller sample sizes does exist, and there is a need for quantifying the reliability of SWC measurements of small samples. The research involved a total of 232 tests carried out on 22 different soil types containing particles no larger than No. 4 sieve size. The water content of soil specimens with varying wetness was measured using both conventional oven-drying and CCGP methods. The error distribution analysis indicated that the CCGP method, as used in this study, estimates the SWC for all soil types with a mean absolute discrepancy of around 0.3\% and 0.2\%, with general and soil specific calibrations, respectively. It was found that the CCGP method is reliable for SWC determination of small specimens up to 20\% of SWC if the manufacturer's instructions are followed. (C) 2014 Sharif University of Technology.

Urban areas are the most vulnerable, and specifically, the road infrastructure. The accumulation of large volumes of water and sediments on road-stream intersections gets severe consequences for the road drainage structures. This study integrates the spatial and temporal soil moisture properties into the research about flood prediction methods by a case study of two areas in Sweden, Vastra Gotaland and Varmland, which was affected by severe flooding in August 2014. Soil moisture data are derived from remote-sensing techniques, with a focus on the soil moisture-specific satellites ASCAT and SMOS. Furthermore, several physical catchments descriptors (PCDs) are analyzed and the result shows that larger slopes and drainage density, in general, mean a higher risk of flooding. The precipitation is the same; however, it can be concluded that more precipitation in most cases gives higher soil moisture values. The lack, or the dimensioning, of road drainage structures seems to have a large impact on the flood risk as more sediment and water can be accumulated at the road-stream intersection. The results show that the method implementing soil moisture satellite data is promising for improving the reliability of flooding.},

The system is based on an open-source ARDUINO microcontroller-board, programmed in a simple integrated development environment (IDE). Low cost high-frequency dielectric probes were used in the platform and lab tested on three non-saline soils (ECe1: 2.5 {\textless} 0.1 mS/cm). Empirical calibration curves were subjected to cross-validation (leave-one-out method), and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) were respectively 0.09 for the overall model, 0.09 for the sandy soil, 0.07 for the clay loam and 0.08 for the sandy loam. The overall model (pooled soil data) fitted the data very well (R-2 = 0.89) showing a high stability, being able to generate very similar RMSEs during training and validation (RMSEtraining = 2.63; RMSEvalidation = 2.61). Data recorded on the card were automatically sent to a remote server allowing repeated field-data quality checks.

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture plays a key role in water and energy exchanges at the land-atmosphere interface. Previous research on the microwave remote sensing of soil moisture focused mostly on the forward modeling problem. This paper presents a unique inversion algorithm (Hong's algorithm) for soil moisture retrieval with reduced degrees of freedom of the Fresnel equation; the algorithm is based on the characteristics of the polarization ratio for rough surfaces around the Brewster angle and Hong's approximation, which is an approximate relationship between vertically and horizontally polarized reflectivities. Using the daily observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) taken at 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees pixel, the soil moisture is estimated globally over the land surface using a relation between the complex dielectric constant and the soil moisture after retrieving the surface roughness and complex dielectric constant. The surface soil moisture products obtained from Hong's algorithm are validated using in situ observations carried out in Oklahoma and Georgia in 2003. The official AMSR-E soil moisture products are compared to assess Hong's algorithm using identical brightness temperature data sets. The biases and the root mean squared error calculated in comparison with the ground observations are in the range of -0.059 m(3)/m(3) to 0.01 m(3)/m(3) and 0.023 m(3)/m(3) to 0.065 m(3)/m(3), respectively. Hong's algorithm estimates the soil moisture within the estimated accuracy of AMSR-E surface soil moisture, 0.06 m(3)/m(3), without requiring a priori information about the roughness and the dielectric constants of the surface. With a minimal use of forward models, this research could also be applied to global soil moisture retrieval in the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite mission and the Soil Moisture Active/Passive mission.

Global trends analysis for 1988-2010 suggests a decrease of surface soil moisture contents (72\% of significant trends are negative, i.e., drying) for ERA-Land and an increase in surface soil moisture (59\% of significant trends are positive, i.e., wetting) for MERRA-Land. As the spatial extent and fractions of significant trends in both products differ, the trend reflected in the majority of grid points within different climate classes was investigated and compared to that of SM-MW. The latter is dominated by negative significant trends (73.2\%) and is more in line with ERA-Land.

Soil moisture skill (defined as the anomaly time series correlation coefficient R) is assessed using in situ observations in the continental United States at 37 single-profile sites within the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) for which skillful AMSR-E retrievals are available and at 4 USDA Agricultural Research Service (”Cal Val”) watersheds with high-quality distributed sensor networks that measure soil moisture at the scale of land model and satellite estimates.

The skill of MERRA surface and root-zone soil moisture is R = 0.43 and R = 0.47, respectively, versus SCAN measurements. MERRA surface moisture skill is R = 0.56 versus CalVal measurements. Adding information from precipitation observations increases (surface and root zone) soil moisture skills by Delta R similar to 0.06. Assimilating AMSR-E retrievals increases soil moisture skills by Delta R similar to 0.08.

A valuable technique to investigate this link is the prescription of soil moisture in land surface models, which leads to a decoupling of the atmosphere and land processes. Diverse approaches to prescribe soil moisture, as well as different prescribed soil moisture conditions have been used in previous studies. Here, we compare and assess four methodologies to prescribe soil moisture and investigate the impact of two different estimates of the climatological seasonal cycle used to prescribe soil moisture. Our analysis shows that, though in appearance similar, the different approaches require substantially different long-term moisture inputs and lead to different temperature signals. The smallest influence on temperature and the water balance is found when prescribing the median seasonal cycle of deep soil liquid water, whereas the strongest signal is found when prescribing soil liquid and soil ice using the mean seasonal cycle. These results indicate that induced net water-balance perturbations in experiments investigating soil moisture-climate coupling are important contributors to the climate response, in addition to the intended impact of the decoupling. These results help to guide the set-up of future experiments prescribing soil moisture, as for instance planned within the Land Surface, Snow and Soil Moisture Model Intercomparison Project (LS3MIP).},

About 70\% of the Iowa samples were selected for the calibration set, and the rest of the Iowa samples and all of the Minnesota samples were assigned to validation set I and validation set II, respectively. Calibrations were based on partial least-squares regression (PLSR), using the first differentials of log (1/R) for the 1100 to 2500-nm spectral range. The results for the calibration set and validation set I indicated that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict many soil properties (total C, organic C, inorganic C, total N, CEC, \% clay, and moisture) with reasonable accuracy for both the air-dried (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.76) and moist (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.74) soils. The results for validation set II showed that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict some properties of soils (total C, organic C, total N, and moisture content) from a different geographic region, but other soil properties in validation set II were not accurately predicted. Although NIRS-PLSR predictions are slightly more accurate for air-dried soils than for moist soils, the results indicate that the NIRS-PLSR technique can be used for analysis of field moist samples with acceptable accuracy as long as diverse soil samples from the same region are included in the calibration database.},

	abstract = {Dual probe heat pulse (DPHP) sensors are economical solutions for soil moisture measurements. However, in agriculture fields the temperature significantly changes from time to time during 24 h, which affects response of the soil moisture sensor. This paper, analyzes and models the error produced in the response of the DPHP sensors due to variation of the soil temperature. For this purpose, first effect of the soil temperature on the response of the sensor is studied using eight different soil samples. Accordingly, the existing soil moisture model, used for DPHP devices, is modified and used for the temperature compensation. A low power DPHP sensor comprising one heater probe and one temperature sensor probe, placed 0.003 m apart, is fabricated. A low power, automated system, dissipating average power of 30 mW, is also developed for the field measurements to validate the proposed model. The developed system is deployed in the field and soil moisture is measured for 38 h at every 1 h interval. Field measurements indicates that volumetric moisture content measured without temperature compensation leads to error of about 3\% and with temperature compensation the error is reduced to 0.5\%.

	abstract = {The conventional methods frequently used in Cuba to determine some fertility parameters important for sugarcane production, such as organic matter (OM), available phosphorus (P) and potassium (K2O), are difficult, costly, and time-consuming procedures. This study was undertaken to build and validate Visible/Near Infrared Reflectance (Vis/NIR) calibration models of these parameters at landscape level and within a field, by taking into consideration their correlation coefficients with the OM. The parameters P and K2O, which are not spectrally active in the Vis/NIR range should be better predicted when are highly correlated with OM. Also, the wavelength intervals to simplify this methodology were selected. Samples were air-dried before scanning using a diode array spectrophotometer covering the wavelength range from 399 to 1697 nm. The regression models were built by using the linear multivariate regression method Partial Least Squares (PLS), and the nonlinear multivariate regression methods Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Locally Weighted Regression (LWR). At landscape level the best correlations between soil spectra and OM (0.90 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.93; 0.12 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 0.14) were obtained with LWR, followed by K2O with LWR (0.77 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.79; 3.47 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 3.62), Olsen P (0.69 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.81; 0.27 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 0.35) and Oniani P (0.64 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.65; 3.31 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 3.61) both with SVM. Also the nonlinear regression models gave the best results within a field. The higher values for OM (R-2 = 0.92; RMSEP = 0.14) and Olsen P (0.68 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.83; 0.27 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 0.34) were observed with SVM, while for K2O (0.16 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.63; 5.13 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 5.88), and Oniani P (0.70 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.72; 2.32 {\textless}= RMSEP {\textless}= 2.52) were obtained with LWR.

The results will help to guide the design of an experimental apparatus which aims to study the coupled heat and moisture transfer in soils at high temperatures of higher than 40 degrees C with the highest possible spatial resolution. The interference effect between two adjacent time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes has been evaluated and analyzed experimentally. It was observed that the distance between the probes, soil texture, and the water content of the testing soil is the key parameters which affect the interference and TDR probe capability of measurement. In this study, three types of soils were examined, namely FSJ\#1 (silty clay), Matilda (loamy sand), and Ottawa sand C-190 (quartz sand). Three different volumetric water contents were evaluated for each soil. The interference effect was noticeable in all soil samples when the distances between the probes were 1 cm. For the samples with higher moisture content, the effect of interference on the TDRs' electromagnetic waveform signals is more prominent. Interference was found in Matilda samples with degrees of saturations of 0.5 and higher even though the distances between the probes were greater than 1 cm; nevertheless, the determination of volumetric water content was not affected by the interference, because the interference only caused the two TDRs' electromagnetic waveform signals to shift by the same length. No interference was observed in cases of FSJ\#1 and Ottawa sand when the distances between the probes were greater than 1 cm. From the results, it was found that the sensitivity zone of our TDR equipment is a radius of about 10 mm surrounding the central needle of the TDR probe. In case of FSJ\#1, when interference occurs, the measurement error of water content significantly increases from 9.3\% to 15.5\%, corresponding to the degree of saturation from 0.25 to 1.0.},

The 114 sites in this sparse network are well distributed across the conterminous United States in open, rural locations expected to remain unchanged in land use for many decades into the future. Soil probes are installed in triplicate redundancy, similar to the air temperature and precipitation measurements, at either five standard World Meteorological Organization (WMO) depths (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm) or only two depths (5 and 10 cm) depending on the nature of the underlying materials. Stations also measure air temperature, surface skin temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and 1.5-m wind speed. In addition to sensor failure, the triplicate design of USCRN soil probes have allowed for an initial characterization of variability of soil moisture measurements. Nationwide analysis of soil moisture during early-to-mid growing season in 2011 and 2012 was performed to examine the differences in response to the widespread drought of 2012. The redundancy of the network helps retain the continuity of the record over time, and also provides key insights into the variations of measurements at a single location that are related to a combination of installation effects and the impacts of soil differences at the local level. This article highlights the usefulness of deploying triplicate configurations of soil probes for detecting faulty sensors and for better understanding the nature of soil moisture measurement variability.},

	abstract = {Though researchers have employed various techniques (gravimetric, electromagnetic, neutron scattering, heat pulse, microwave, and optical remote sensing techniques) for soil moisture measurement, dielectric-based techniques (Time Domain Reflectometry [TDR] and capacitance technique [CT]) have gained much more popularity, mainly due to revolutionary developments in the fields of electronics and data communication systems. However, the suitability and relative performance of these techniques for moisture measurement of soils is a point of debate. Hence, in order to address this issue, extensive studies were conducted on soils of entirely different characteristics, compacted at various compaction states (dry densities and water contents) by employing TDR and capacitance probes. Subsequently, the dielectric constant of the soil and its bulk electrical conductivity were obtained using these probes and compared against each other and those computed from Topp's equation, which is a well-established relationship between the dielectric constant of the soil and its volumetric moisture content. An attempt was also made to correlate Ka values obtained from the dielectric techniques and Topp's equation with those of the Time Propagation (TP) Mixing model, which incorporates the properties of the soil matrix as well. It has been observed that the Ka-TDR matches well with the Ka-Topp and Ka-TP, while the best match has been observed between Ka-TDR and Ka-Topp as compared to the Ka-CT. As such, the study demonstrates clearly that Topp's equation, which ignores the soil-specific parameters, is capable of determining the soil moisture content appropriately. This study proposes an empirical equation that relates dielectric constants obtained from Topp's equation to those obtained from TDR, CT, and the TP Mixing model. Such a relationship can be further utilized for estimating the volumetric soil moisture content.},

The algorithm-the multivariate, non-parametric regression-tree estimator Random Forest-was used to predict soil-water storage based on a combination of attributes at each instrument cluster (soil texture, topographic wetness index, elevation, northness, and canopy cover). Out-of-bag R-2 (similar to cross-validation for Random Forest) was used to quantify the accuracy of the estimator for unobserved data. Accuracy was consistently high during the wet-up, snow-cover, and early recession periods of average and wet years. The accuracy declined at the end of a 3-yr dry period, and the relative rank of the independent variables in the model shifted. Soil texture was the highest-ranked independent variable across all years, followed by elevation and northness. Topographic wetness increased in importance during dry periods. Northness exhibited high importance during the wet-up and early recession periods of most water years. During dry years, the importance of elevation declined. In dry years, notable differences in soil-water storage at each depth include lower-than-average storage in the deeper regolith at the beginning of the water year and lower storage in near-surface layers during the winter resulting from transient snow cover.},

	abstract = {Global monitoring of soil moisture and snow is now available through various satellite observations from optical, microwave, and gravitational sensors. However, very few modeling frameworks exist that conjointly use the above sensors to produce mutually and physically consistent earth system records. To this goal, a prototype of multi-sensor land data assimilation system is developed by linking the Community Land Model version 4 (CLM4) and a series of forward models with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic Ensemble Adjustment Kalman Filter (EAKF) within the DART is utilized to estimate global soil moisture and snow by assimilating brightness temperature, snow cover fraction, and daily total water storage observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), respectively. A 40-member of Community Atmosphere Model version 4 (CAM4) reanalysis is adopted to introduce ensemble spread in CLM4 land states and some methods are used to reduce the computational load. Data assimilation with different combinations of sensors is implemented for 2003-2009 to investigate individual contributions from different satellite observations. Evaluation results and cross-comparison of open-loop and data assimilation cases suggest that 1) assimilation of MODIS snow cover fraction slightly improves snow estimation in mid and high latitudes; 2) lower and higher frequencies of AMSR-E brightness temperature play complementary roles in improving global soil moisture and snow estimation; 3) assimilation of GRACE tends to degrade soil moisture estimation but poses potential in improving snow depth estimation in most high-latitude regions. Generally, the combination of MODIS, GRACE, and AMSR-E observations with regard to spatial locations holds promise to provide a robust global soil moisture and snow estimation through the multi-sensor land data assimilation system.},

At least two techniques can be used, the first using the soil capacitance as part of a low pass filter, measuring the attenuation of a fixed frequency signal, the second using the soil capacitance as the controlling component in a variable frequency oscillator. Whilst the two techniques demonstrate differing sensitivities to different conditions, they demonstrate an acceptably stable reciprocal relationship to each other over a wide range of soil moisture conditions. With insulated probes, it is possible under field conditions for these probes to be damaged or for moisture to creep into the electronics housing. Either of these conditions make the soil capacitor appear to `leak' by providing a lower electrically resistive path in parallel with the soil capacitance. This resistance affects the measurements of the two techniques described above in different ways and thus readings from the sensors diverge from their normal relationships. These variations are measureable and thus the fault condition can be automatically detected. This can be used to flag potential problems in the soil moisture measurements raising an alarm condition, or stopping unnecessary irrigation based on erroneous results from a damaged sensor.

This region is flat with sparse vegetation cover consisting of only grass, thereby minimizing the effects of terrain and vegetation. Considering the two possibilities of the measurement support volume of the CRS, the results of four weighting methods are compared with the SWC monitored by FDR within an appropriate measurement support volume. The weighted average calculated using the neutron intensity-based weighting method (Ni weighting method) best fits the regionally averaged SWC measured by the CRS. Therefore, we conclude that the gyroscopic support volume and the weights determined by the Ni weighting method are the closest to the actual spatial features of the CRS when measuring the SWC. Based on these findings, a scale transformation model of the SWC from the point scale to the scale of the CRS measurement support volume is established. In addition, the spatial features simulated using the Ni weighting method are visualized by developing a software system.},

	abstract = {Treated urban wastewater has been increasingly used for irrigation to increase crop production, but inadequate management of this marginal quality saline water cannot only reduce crop yield but also degrade soil. To increase sustainability, a sound irrigation policy based on real-time soil states is needed to avoid the adverse effects from excess salinity in soils. In real applications, uncertain model inputs and soil heterogeneity are expected when a modeling approach is used. In addition, sensor measurement information is generally insufficient to characterize the state of the soil profile in detail. To overcome these limitations, a monitoring and modeling system assimilating embedded sensor datastreams into a hydrologic model to improve real-time soil state estimates over the whole profile of interest is examined with a wastewater reuse system in Palmdale, CA. Experimental results show that under an unknown heterogeneous soil, the filtering scheme is able to describe the spatial variability of moisture and soil solution electrical conductivity in soils due to direct state estimation by assimilating moisture and electrical conductivity measurements and also due to improved soil hydraulic parameter estimates through the data assimilation framework. Two data withholding validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the added value of assimilating measurements. The spatial data withholding experiment demonstrates that state predictions at unobserved areas can be improved via the assimilation if the soil system is relatively homogeneous and effects from erroneous irrigation forcing are reduced. The temporal data withholding experiment indicates that a high update frequency can maintain the reliability of state estimation. Overall, this system can provide a more accurate soil characterization that could be used to optimize irrigation management to reduce adverse effects from wastewater reuse.},

The Fundamental Climate Data Record (FCDR) of F08, F11 and F13 SSM/I satellites by the Precipitation Research Group of Colorado State University is used for this study. A soil moisture retrieval algorithm is developed based on a radiative transfer model that simulates top-of-atmosphere T-B's whereby effects of atmosphere are calculated from near-surface forcings obtained from a bias-corrected dataset. Validation of SSM/I retrievals against in situ measurements for a two-and-half year period (225 matchups) gives a Root Mean Squared Error of 0.046m(3) m(-3). The agreement between retrievals and Noah simulations from the Global Land Data Assimilation System is investigated to further provide confidence in the reliability of SSM/I retrievals at the Plateau-scale. Normalised soil moisture anomalies (N) are computed on a warm seasonal (May-October) and on a monthly basis to analyse the trends present within the products available from July 1987 to December 2008. The slope of linear regression functions between N and time is used to quantify the trends. Both the warm season and monthly N indicate severe wettings of 0.8 to almost 1.6 decade(-1) in the centre of the Plateau. Correlations are found by the trend with elevation for the warm season as a whole and the individual months May, September and October.

Ion-selective electrodes are promising candidates because they have rapid response, directly measure the analyte, and are small and portable. Our goal was to investigate the ability of three different phosphate ion-selective electrodes (two fabricated with organotin compound-based PVC membranes, and one fabricated from a cobalt rod) used in conjunction with Kelowna soil extractant to determine phosphorus over the typical range of soil concentrations. Electrodes using organotin compound-based PVC membranes containing bis(p-chlorobenzyl)tin dichloride as an ionophore exhibited sensitive responses to HPO42- over a range of 10(-4) to 10(-1) mol/L in Tris buffer at pH 7. They were nearly insensitive to phosphate when using Kelowna soil extractant as the base solution, perhaps because of the high concentration of fluoride (0.015 mol/L) in the Kelowna solution. In addition, the life of the membranes was less than 14 days. Electrodes using another tin-compound-based PVC membrane containing tributyltin chloride as an ionophore also provided unsatisfactory results, showing much less sensitivity to H2PO4- than previously reported. The cobalt rod-based electrodes exhibited sensitive responses to H2PO4- over a range from 10(-5) to 10(-1) mol/L total phosphate concentration with a detection limit of 10(-5) mol/L in the Kelowna solution. This detection range would encompass the typical range of soil phosphorus concentrations measured in agricultural fields. The selectivity of the cobalt electrodes was satisfactory for measuring phosphates in the presence of each of six interfering ions, i.e., HCO3-, Cl-, Br-, NO3-, Ac-, and F-, with the electrodes being 47 to 1072 times more responsive to phosphate than to the tested interfering ions.},

	abstract = {Microdialysis is a technique that can be used to sample fluxes of nitrogen (N) in soils with minimal disturbance. To advance our understanding of the technique and improve N recovery, we compared a common membrane type (10 x 0:5 mm probe length and width, 20 kDa molecular weight cut-off; MWCO) with alternative length and MWCO configurations (30 mm; and 100 kDa MWCO). We hypothesised that the alternative membranes would improve recovery of low molecular weight N via increased surface area and membrane pore size. The test environments, sampled at fixed pump flow rates, were: (i) stirred 100 mu M N standard solution containing organic (amino acid) and inorganic (ammonium, nitrate) N; (ii) soil spiked with 100 mu M standard N solution; and (iii) in situ boreal forest soil. In general, long membranes recovered more N, but the magnitude of improved recovery varied with test environment. Long membranes recovered more inorganic N regardless of flow rate, except ammonium in stirred solution, where length had no effect at slow flow rates. Long membranes also recovered more organic N from stirred solution regardless of flow rate, and recovered most N at slow flow rates in spiked soil. Longer membranes recovered more amino acids in situ in forest soil, with improved resolution of individual amino acids, but were biased towards soluble, mobile forms. MWCO did not affect N recoveries, indicating that in the test conditions, membrane length had greater control than pore size. We discuss the bottlenecks of microdialysis application in soil research and conclude that optimised membrane configurations will advance its use as a tool for quantifying nutrient fluxes in soils.

	abstract = {This study evaluated the family of ECH2O sensors (EC-5 and ECH2O-TE) for measurement of soil moisture content (theta), bulk electrical conductivity (ECb) and temperature for a range of soils, across a range of measurement frequencies between 5 and 150 MHz. Measurement frequency is one of the primary factors affecting the sensitivity of capacitance sensor measurements to soil variables such as soil texture, electrical conductivity, and temperature. Measurements in both soil and solution demonstrated that the ECH2O EC and TE measurements were accurate. Using a measurement frequency of 70 MHz, a single calibration curve was determined for a range of mineral soils, independent of soil salinity, suggesting there might be no need for a soil specific calibration. When combining all data for each soil type, the R-2 values remained high (R-2 = 0.98) with little probe to probe variability. After laboratory calibration, the error for theta was about 2\%, independent of soil ECb, up to a soil solution EC of about 12 dS/m. Our results showed that a single calibration curve could be used for all tested mineral soils, independent of soil salinity. The bulk soil ECb - water content data were excellently described by a polynomial expression. Measurements of temperature sensitivity to soil water content and ECb were sufficiently small. For example, for a temperature change of 10 degrees C, measurements of theta and ECb were affected by about 0.02 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.02 dS/m, respectively. Limited sensor calibration requirements are important, when large networks of soil moisture sensors are being deployed. It is concluded that an accurate, cost-effective soil moisture sensor is available that operates at a measurement frequency of 70 MHz, with a low sensitivity to confounding soil environmental factors.

	abstract = {More attention has been paid to estimating soil nutrient status, along with a sharp decrease in total farmland acreage, especially in Beijing Municipality. However, traditional site-specific investigation makes it impossible to apply it to large scale monitoring. The objective of this study was to evaluate and classify soil nutrient status using advanced 3S (global positioning system, GPS; remote sensing, RS; and geographic information system, GIS) technology. Firstly, multi-temporal Landsat TM 5 images with 30 m spatial resolution were utilized to identify the field-scale farmlands. The overall classification accuracy reached 86.96\%, with a kappa coefficient of 0.743. Additionally, the correlation coefficient (r) reached 0.942 by comparing the remote sensing-based farmland area with the statistical data. Subsequently, organic matter, total nitrogen, available phosphorus and available potassium from 7,435 field sample points positioned by GPS receiver, were used to generate a comprehensive soil nutrient index in GIS software, according to the classification criteria of Beijing Soil and Fertilizer Workshop. Finally, a classification map of field-scale soil nutrient levels (very high, high, moderate, low \& very low) was created using the farmlands as mask layers. The analysis results showed that the soils at moderate and low levels dominated the Beijing's farmlands, which accounted for 46.1\% and 39.1\%, respectively; high and very low level soils were the second place whose ratios were 10.4\% and 4.3\%, respectively; and very high level soils could be rarely found. Yanqing County, Tongzhou District and Changping District have better soil nutrient status as a whole. (C) 2012 Friends Science Publishers},

At the first depth, soil potassium (K) was significantly greater with 75 percent NPK (246mgkg(-1)) than other treatments. In cocoa, soil pH varied significantly due to fertigation at both depths. The SOC was reduced due to 75 percent NPK at the first depth. In cocoa, the P availability increased significantly with application of VCE at 20 percent N. Fertigation of 75 percent NPK maintained significantly greater soil K and soil Mg than other treatments.

	abstract = {On-line measurement of soil compaction is needed for site specific tillage management. The soil bulk density (rho) indicating soil compaction was measured on-line by means of a developed compaction sensor system that comprised several sensors for on-line measurement of the draught (D) of a soil cutting tool (subsoiler), the soil cutting depth (d) and the soil moisture content (w). The subsoiler D was measured with a single shear beam load cell, whereas d was measured with a wheel gauge that consisted of a swinging arm metal wheel and a linear variable differential transducer (LVDT). The soil w was measured with a near infrared fibre-type spectrophotometer sensor. These on-line three measured parameters were used to calculate p, by utilising a hybrid numerical-statistical mathematical model developed in a previous study. Punctual kriging was performed using the variogram estimation and spatial prediction with error (VESPER) 1.6 software to develop the field maps of rho, soil w, subsoiler d and D, based on 10 m x 10 m grid. To verify the on-line measured rho map, this map was compared with the map measured by the conventional core sampling method. The spherical semivariogram models, providing the best fit for all properties was used for kriging of different maps. Maps developed showed that no clear correlation could be detected between different parameters measured and subsoiler D. However, the D value was smaller at shallow penetration d, whereas large D coincided with large rho values at few positions in the field. Maps of rho measured with the core sampling and on-line methods were similar, with correlation coefficient (r) and the standard error values of 0.75 and 0.054 Mg m(-3), respectively. On-line measured rho exhibited larger errors at very dry zones. The normal distribution of the rho error between the two different measurement methods showed that about 72\% of the errors were less than 0.05 Mg m(-3) in absolute values. However, the overall mean error of on-line measured rho was of a small value of 2.3\%, which ensures the method accuracy for on-line measurement of p. Measurement under very dry conditions should be minimised, because it can lead to a relatively large error, and hence, compacted zones at dry zones cannot be detected correctly.

Experiments were arranged in split-split plot arrangements with three replications. Main plots consisted of (G(1)): establishing a mixed vegetation of vetch and barley, (G(2)): without green manure. Also, five strategies for obtaining the base fertilizer requirement including (N-1): farm manure; (N-2): compost; (N-3): triple super phosphate; (N-4): farm manure + compost and (N-5): farm manure + compost + triple super phosphate. Four levels of biofertilizers consisted of (B-1): Phosphate solubilizing bacteria; (B-2): Trichoderma harzianum; (B-3): Phosphate solubilizing bacteria + T. harzianum; and (B-4): without biofertilizers were arranged in sub-sub plots. Results showed that green manure increased pod number and number of fertile pods per plant. Integrating biofertilizers (B-3) and green manure (G(1)) produced the highest pod number per plant and grain yield. The highest amounts of yield and yield components were obtained in G(1)N(5) treatment. Comparison of 3-way interactions showed that G(1)N(5)B(3) was the best treatment. Significant increase of N, P, K, Fe and Mg content in leaves and grains emphasized on superiority of mentioned treatment because each one of these nutrients has an approved role in chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis ability of the crop. The N-5 treatment in addition to having the highest yield had the best grain quality due to high protein, starch and total sugar contents, low crude fiber and reduced cooking time.},

The study was conducted in a silvopastoral system in Sao Carlos, Brazil (22 degrees 01' South and 47 degrees 53' West). The silvopastoral system consisted of grass pastures [Urochloa (sin. Brachiaria) decumbens cv. Basilik] lined with strips of native trees spaced at 17 m. Continuous microclimate measurements (air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and incident photosynthetically active radiation) were carried out from September 2010 to September 2012 at two positions of the silvopastoral system (2.0 and 8.5 m from the rows of trees) and at a pasture under full sunlight, located in an adjacent area. The soil moisture was monitored weekly from 24 March 2010 to 1 April 2012 at distances of 0.0, 2.0, 4.75, and 8.5 m from the rows of trees. The rows of native trees reduced wind speeds (46\% reduction) and changed the photosynthetically active radiation incidence pattern on the pasture (up to 40\% reduction of incidence at the point nearest to the trees). The combined action of these factors promoted thermal and air humidity changes on the pasture at the different points measured. With respect to soil moisture, there was greater soil moisture removal at the sampling points near the rows of native trees under the silvopastoral system, mainly due to enhanced exploration by tree roots at greater depths in dry spells or early dry periods, when compared with the midpoints between the rows.},

This mosaic complex of vegetation types comprises restinga forest in advanced (high restinga) and medium regeneration stages (low restinga), each with particular differentiating vegetation characteristics. The climate along the coast is tropical (Koppen). Of all ecosystems of the Atlantic Forest, Restinga is the most fragile and susceptible to anthropic disturbances. Plants respond to soil characteristics with physiological and morphological modifications, resulting in changes in the architecture (spatial configuration) of the root system. The purpose of this study was to characterize the soil fertility of high and low restinga forests, by chemical and physical parameters, and its relation to the root system distribution in the soil profile. Four locations were studied: (1) Ilha Anchieta State Park, Ubatuba; (2) two Ecological Stations of Jureia-Itatins and of Chauas, in the municipality of Iguape; (3) Vila de Pedrinhas in the municipality of llha Comprida; and (4) Ilha do Cardoso State Park, Cananeia. The soil fertility (chemical and physical properties) was analyzed in the layers 0-5, 0-10, 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm. In addition, the distribution of the root system in the soil profile was evaluated, using digital images and the Spring program. It was concluded that the root system of all vegetation types studied is restricted to the surface layers, 0-10 and 10-20 cm, but occupies mainly the 0-10 cm layer (70 \%); that soil fertility is low in all environments studied, with base saturation values below 16 \%, since most exchange sites are occupied by aluminum; and that restinga vegetation is edaphic.},

	abstract = {A confluence of scientific and technological developments in geospatial data have made it possible to para-meterise the components of the soil water balance equation in space and time at spatial and temporal resolutions useful for agriculture. In this work, we present results on the development of an approach that takes advantage of this opportunity to predict soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 90 m on a daily time step at multiple depths in the profile. Three types of water balance model were examined: (i) single layer model with saturated flow (ii) multi-layer model with saturated flow and (iii) multi-layer model with unsaturated flow. Five layers were considered: 0-5, 5-15, 15-30, 30-60, and 60-100 cm, which coincide with the layers of the Soil Landscape Grid of Australia which is available at similar to 90 m spatial resolution. Pedotransfer functions were used to predict the bucket size for each soil layer. Precipitation and evapotranspiration are estimated by gridded SILO precipitation data (5 km, 1 day) and the MODIS 16 ET product (1 km, 8 day), respectively. Soil moisture predictions were tested against four publicly and privately owned soil moisture networks. The multi-layer model incorporating unsaturated flow performed the best in terms of predicting soil moisture for the whole profile (0-1 m) with a median correlation coefficient (r) of just over 0.7 across all sites. When classifying the sites according to the land use; cropping sites showed better median correlation (similar to 0.8) than grazing sites (similar to 0.7). However, grazing sites seem to have more consistent results for all the layers. To understand the relative importance of the water balance model predictions as compared to other environmental properties, a Random Forest model was fitted to a suite of variables e.g. soil order, month, temperature and etc., that vary in space, time or both space and time. For the analysis, only calibrated soil moisture network sites (OzNet) were considered. Soil moisture which was derived from unsaturated soil water balance model was the 9th most important variable. To assess the quality of the predictive model, leave-one-out-site cross validation (LOOSCV) was performed and across all sites the prediction quality was reasonable (Concordance = 0.66, Accuracy = 0.06 cm 3 cm(-3)). These results highlight the potential of this approach and since it is based on readily available data it is scalable to large spatial domains.},

The data from 15 moisture sensors placed in the area covered by the system were collected by a central unit using radio transmission. The soil moisture was estimated via an artificial neural network with the data obtained for micro-regions. Next, the locations of the moisture sensors in the area were optimized using a genetic algorithm to provide the optimum energy and water consumption in the system. Subsequently, the drip irrigation was controlled using moisture data from only five sensors located at the best points, as determined by the genetic algorithm. The obtained experimental results indicated that the moisture rate at the end of the period of irrigation using the system developed was more homogeneous than that of traditional irrigation systems for each micro-region using only five soil moisture sensors in a non-homogeneous area. Thus, daily energy and water consumption were decreased by 32 \%, while the moisture rate in the soil was maintained within the desired range.},

Similar to the classical EBCM, we expand the fields in terms of Floquet modes and match the extended boundary conditions at test surfaces away from the actual rough surface to retrieve the surface currents and therefore the scattered fields. However, to solve long-standing stability problems of the classical EBCM, we introduce a z-coordinate transformation to restrict and control the test surface locations explicitly. We also introduce the concepts of moderated test surface locations and balanced k-charts for further stabilization and optimization of the solutions. The computational efficiency is optimized by judicious submatrix decomposition. The resulting bistatic scattering cross sections are validated by comparing with analytical and numerical solutions. Specifically, the solutions are compared with those from the small perturbation method and small-slope approximation within their validity region, and with those from the method of moments outside the validity domains of analytical solutions. It is shown that SEBCM gives accurate, numerically efficient, full-wave solutions over a large range of surface roughnesses and medium losses, which are far beyond the validity range of analytical methods. These properties are expected to make SEBCM a competitive forward solver for soil moisture retrieval from radar measurements.},

The aim of this study was to assess water deficits using Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT). ERT offers several advantages: (i) it is not intrusive, (ii) it exhibits spatial patterns at a decametric or hectometric scale, and (iii) it provides information on both water content and soil depth. The study was conducted on a Mediterranean shaley sandy soil, in the Cevennes (South of France), First, the factors (nature of the pores and organization of the material, water content, soil solution and temperature) on which electrical resistivities depend were analyzed in the laboratory. Soil samples were used to derive the W and W parameters of Archie's relation, changes in the soil solution over time, and the effect of temperature on resistivities. These results were then used to interpret ERT in situ at different times of the year. The water content and water deficit obtained from ERT were then compared with local measurements made using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and the comparison was satisfactory. The results of this study show the potential of measuring soil water content and water deficit using electrical resistivities, and describe how uncertainties in temperature, porosity, and fluid conductivity impact ERT-obtained estimates of soil water content and deficit.

Visualization of the data as 2D sections, 3D tomograms and time series plots for different zones of the embankment enabled the development of seasonal wetting fronts within the embankment to be monitored at a high-spatial resolution and the respective distributions of moisture in the flanks, crest and toes of the embankment to be assessed. Although the embankment considered here is at no immediate risk of failure, the approach developed for this study is equally applicable to other more high-risk earthworks and natural slopes.},

	abstract = {Spaceborne radiometers operating near 1.4 GHz are the primary instrument for recent efforts to remotely sense near-surface soil moisture around the globe. Generally, these instruments must contend with the effects of vegetation growing in the soil. However, an important first step is to model the measurements made by a radiometer that is viewing bare (vegetation-free) soil. The proposed model uses a matching layer and a random depolarizer to describe bare soil surface roughness and some aspects of antenna beamwidth. The model suggests that the effects of near-surface soil moisture and roughness upon the radiometer measurement are more distinct than is currently thought. Furthermore, it appears that both moisture and roughness can be retrieved from a single set of radiometer measurements made at orthogonal linear polarizations. This retrieval precision is predicted to be poor at soil observation angles near nadir but improves for larger angles. At observation angles near 50 degrees, the vertically polarized radiometer measurements are predicted to be nearly insensitive to roughness. A convenient parameterization of the model is provided and permits quick implementation.},

	abstract = {A study was carried out to investigate the utility of L-band SAR data for estimating aboveground biomass in sites with low levels of vegetation regrowth. Data to estimate biomass were collected from 59 sites located in fire-disturbed black spruce forests in interior Alaska. PALSAR L-band data (HH and HV polarizations) collected on two dates in the summer/fall of 2007 and one date in the summer of 2009 were used. Significant linear correlations were found between the log of aboveground biomass (range of 0.02 to 22.2 t ha(-1)) and sigma degrees (L-HH) and sigma degrees (L-HV) for the data collected on each of the three dates, with the highest correlation found using the L-HV data collected when soil moisture was highest. Soil moisture, however, did change the correlations between L-band sigma degrees and aboveground biomass, and the analyses suggest that the influence of soil moisture is biomass dependent. The results indicate that to use L-band SAR data for mapping aboveground biomass and monitoring forest regrowth will require development of approaches to account for the influence that variations in soil moisture have on L-band microwave backscatter, which can be particularly strong when low levels of aboveground biomass occur.

In this paper, we use the concept of time stability in soil water content to exami-ne whether using a short term monitoring period is sufficient to identify a representative site of soil water content and, therefore, irrigation scheduling. Surface moisture-density gauge was used as a means for measuring soil water content. Variations of soil water content in space and time were studied using geostatistical tools. Measuring soil water content was made at 30 locations as nodes of a 6x8 m grid, six times during the growing season. A representative location for average soil water content estimation was allocated at the beginning of a season, and thereafter it was validated. Results indicated that the spatial pattern of soil water content was strongly temporally stable, explained by the relationship between soil water content and fine soil texture. Two field surveys of soil water content, conducted before and after the 1st irrigation, could be sufficient to allocate a representative location of soil water content, and for adequate irrigation scheduling of the whole field. Surface moisture-density gauge was found to be efficient for characterising time stability of soil water content under irrigated field conditions.},

	abstract = {Due to their shallow penetration of the soil column, remote-sensing (RS) soil moisture retrievals are often considered ill-suited for measuring the strength of soil moisture-air temperature coupling. Consequently, soil moisture proxies derived from antecedent rainfall considerations are commonly applied in their place. However, the suitably of satellite RS products has not yet been examined for newer soil moisture products derived from L-band microwave radiometry. This study globally compares correlations between monthly soil moisture and the monthly number of summertime hot days (NHD) for the case of three separate RS-based soil moisture products and a fourth soil moisture proxy derived from the standard precipitation index (SPI). Compared with SPI-based estimates, C- and X-band RS soil moisture products demonstrate a significantly (at p = 0.05 [-] confidence) weaker correlation with NHD. However, 2010-2018 L-band Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) based soil moisture-NHD correlation is generally comparable to the SPI case. Furthermore, utilizing higher-precision 2015-2018 soil moisture products from the L-band Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) mission further strengthens soil moisture-NHD correlation and leads to stronger sampled correlations than SPI over global hot spot regions (significant at p = 0.05 [-] confidence). Combined with the general equivalence of monthly surface and root zone soil moisture anomalies, these results suggest that the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR, i.e. the relative size of soil moisture signal and random observation error variances) of RS-based surface soil moisture product, instead of their vertical measurement depth, is the key limiting factor determining their ability to quantify land atmosphere coupling strengths. Based on this, we argue that L-band soil moisture products have reached a sufficient level of SNR to be of value for the study of land-atmosphere coupling.},

(2) The seasonal difference was found for the temporal dynamics of SSM: it increased in summer and decreased in spring and autumn. (3) For all four regions studied, the temporal dynamics of SSM were similar to those of the whole of NEC, but with different rates of SSM change. Moreover, SSM in regions B and D had a lower spatial variance than the other two regions because of the stable spatial pattern of cropland. (4) The change rates for SSM were consistent with that observed for the warming rates, which indicated that SSM levels derived from remote sensing data will correlate with climate change.

Low frequency electromagnetic induction (EMI) systems have proven to be useful tools in mapping soil apparent electrical conductivity (sa) and soil moisture. However, obtaining depth profile water content is an area that has not been fully explored using EMI. To examine this, we performed time-lapse EMI measurements using a CMD mini-Explorer sensor along a 10m transect of a maize field over a 6 day period. Reference data were measured at the end of the profile via an excavated pit using 5TE capacitance sensors. In order to derive a time-lapse, depth-specific subsurface image of electrical conductivity (sigma), we applied a probabilistic sampling approach, DREAM((ZS)), on the measured EMI data. The inversely estimated sigma values were subsequently converted to theta using the Rhoades et al. (1976) petrophysical relationship. The uncertainties in measured sigma(a), as well as inaccuracies in the inverted data, introduced some discrepancies between estimated s and reference values in time and space. Moreover, the disparity between the measurement footprints of the 5TE and CMD Mini-Explorer sensors also led to differences. The obtained theta permitted an accurate monitoring of the spatiotemporal distribution and variation of soil water content due to root water uptake and evaporation. The proposed EMI measurement and modeling technique also allowed for detecting temporal root zone soil moisture variations. The time-lapse theta monitoring approach developed using DREAM( ZS) thus appears to be a useful technique to understand spatiotemporal patterns of soil water content and provide insights into linked soil moisture vegetation processes and the dynamics of soil moisture/infiltration processes.},

We have investigated a novel monitoring method using ultrasonic waves. The detector is composed of an ultrasonic transducer and a brass pipe whose lower end is inserted vertically into the ground. Ultrasonic waves generated by the transducer at the upper end of the pipe travel through it underground, and are reflected from the soil's surface at the bottom of the pipe. The soil's moisture is monitored by the intensity of the reflected ultrasonic waves and the groundwater level is monitored by the propagation time of the same waves. Indoor experiments were carried out using an artificial rainfall simulator and a soil tank. Shigaraki soil and Toyoura sand were used as soil samples in the experiments. The intensity of the reflected waves increased with the soil's water content and changed dramatically depending on whether the soil was fully dry, wet, or fully saturated. The propagation time decreased as the groundwater level rose. This method has advantages in that the detector can easily be installed on the ground surface and can simultaneously monitor both the soil moisture and groundwater level.

In this study, a PulseEkko 1000 GPR system with 450 MHz antennas was used at a sandy loam soil site. Water contents measured with time domain reflectometry (TDR) were used to determine the sampling depth of GPR based water content estimates. Cumulative irrigation and drainage calculated with GPR were found to be more closely related with cumulative irrigation and drainage measured with shorter TDR probes, suggesting that the ground wave sampling depth was in the 0.2-0.5 m range. During the infiltration phase the depth of the ground wave penetration was found to be in the 0-0.56 m range, assuming a sharp boundary between wet and dry sand.

	abstract = {In arid prairie, soil moisture has a substantial impact on the prairie resource management. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR) based soil moisture retrieval is often hampered by vegetation effects on the backscattering coefficient. A new method has been proposed to retrieve soil moisture using TerraSAR-X data. The developed method included bare soil backscattering sigma(o)(ppsoil) simulation, vegetation effect correction, and the relationship between sigma(o)(ppsoil) and soil moisture establishment. The bare soil surface was described using the forward advanced integral equation model. The vegetation influence was eliminated through an empirical ratio method. Soil moisture was retrieved from the estimated sigma(o)(ppsoil). The collected datasets in Wutumeiren prairie were used to verify the developed method. Four different vegetation variables were incorporated to separate the influence of vegetation, including leaf area index (LAI), normalized difference vegetation index, enhanced vegetation index, and vegetation water content, respectively. The lowest soil moisture inversion error was found when LAI was applied to decouple the effect of vegetation, which led the root mean square error to reach up to 5.02 vol.\%. From the perspective of experiment results, LAI was recommended to characterize the scattering mechanism of vegetation. These results indicated that TerraSAR-X data have an operational potential for soil moisture retrieval in arid prairie. (C) 2015 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) and the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) are continuous models developed for evaluating the environmental effects of agricultural management. Traditionally, these models have simulated soil water percolation processes using a tipping-bucket approach, with the rate of flow limited by the saturated hydraulic conductivity. This simple approach often leads to inaccuracy in simulating elevated soil water conditions where soil water content (SWC) levels may remain above field capacity under prolonged wet weather periods or limited drainage. To overcome this deficiency, a new sub-model, the variable saturation hydraulic conductivity (VSHC) method, was developed for simulating soil water percolation processes using a nonlinear equation to estimate the effective hydraulic conductivity as a function of the SWC and soil properties. The VSHC method was evaluated at three sites in the United States and two sites in Europe. In addition, a numerical solution of the Richards equation was used as a benchmark for SWC comparison. Results show that the VSHC method substantially improves the accuracy of the SWC simulation in long-term simulations, particularly during wet periods. At the watershed scale, results on the Riesel Y2 watershed indicate that the VSHC method enhances model performance in the high-flow regime of channel peak flows because of the improved estimation of SWC, which implies that the improved SWC simulation at the field scale is beneficial to hydrologic modeling at the watershed scale.},

SMOS was launched in 2009 by the European Space Agency (ESA). The aims of this study are to present the AQUI network and to evaluate the SMOS SM product (in the new SMOS-IC version) along with other microwave SM products such as the active ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer) and the ESA combined (passive and active) CCI (Climate Change Initiative) SM retrievals. A first comparison, using Pearson correlation, Bias, RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), and Un biased RMSE (ubRMSE) scores, between the 0-5 cm AQUI network and ASCAT, CCI, and SMOS SM products was conducted. In general all the three products were able to reproduce the annual cycle of the AQUI in situ observations. CCI and ASCAT had best and similar correlations (R similar to 0.72) over the Bouron and Bilos sites. All had comparable correlations over the Hermitage sites with overall average values of 0.74, 0.68, and 0.69 for CCI, SMOS-IC, and ASCAT, respectively. Considering anomalies, correlation values decreased for all products with best ability to capture day to day variations obtained by ASCAT. CCI (followed by SMOS-IC) had the best ubRMSE values (mostly {\textless} 0.04 m(3)/m(3)) over most of the stations. Although the region is highly impacted by radio frequency interferences, SMOS-IC followed correctly the in situ SM dynamics. All the three remotely-sensed SM products (except SMOS-IC over some stations) overestimated the AQUI in situ SM observations. These results demonstrate that the AQUI network is likely to be well-suited for satellite microwave remote sensing evaluations/validations.},

The present paper investigates the temporal variability of soil moisture in three different forest ecosystems (LTER - long term ecological research site) with the same soil type (Eutric Cambisol). Soil moisture was measured daily from 2011 to 2016 by using three sensors at three different depths (20, 40, 70 cm). We identified the interactions between soil properties, vegetation type, local climatic conditions and soil moisture. In order to establish the temporal variability of the soil moisture content, we have applied two procedures, namely the Fourier series and the neural network fitting. A high variability in time and depth for soil volumetric water content was identified. The highest soil moisture levels were recorded at higher depths (70 cm) for almost all surfaces, with the exception of the Fundata surface because of the occurrence of limestone. In the mountainous areas, with higher precipitation (Fundata and Predeal sites), volumetric soil water content was mainly influenced by soil physical characteristics. Soil moisture levels below the drought level were only recorded for the Stalpeni site from September to October 2012. There was a delay between the precipitation event and soil humidification of 0.4-0.8 time units (days). We also found a significant correlation between soil moisture and soil texture and a weak correlation with vegetation type. Temperature influenced soil moisture levels at almost all depths, while precipitation only had an impact when there was a delay of 1 or 2 days. Our results can serve as a scientific base in the monitoring and analysing of soil moisture against the background of a changing climate.},

	abstract = {Contour hedgerow intercropping systems have been proposed as an alternative to traditional agricultural practice with a single crop, as they are effective in reducing run-off and soil erosion. However, competition for water and nutrients between crops and associated hedgerows may reduce the overall performance of these systems. To get a more detailed understanding of the competition for water, spatially resolved monitoring of soil water contents in the soil-plant-atmosphere system is necessary. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is potentially a valuable technique to monitor changes in soil moisture in space andtime. In this study, the performance of different ERT electrode arrays to detect the soil moisture dynamics in a mono-and an intercropping system was tested. Their performance was analyzed based on a synthetic study using geophysical measures, such as data recovery and resolution, and using spatial statistics of retrieved water content, such as an adjusted coefficient of variation and semivariances. The synthetic ERT measurements detected differences between the cropping systems and retrieved spatial structure of the soil moisture distribution, but the variance and semivariance were underestimated. Sharp water content contrasts between horizons or in the neighborhood of a root water uptake bulb were smoothened. The addition of electrodes deeper in the soil improved the performance, but sometimes only marginally. ERT is therefore a valuable tool for soil moisture monitoring in the field under different cropping systems if an electrode array is used which can resolve the patterns expected to be present in the medium. The use of spatial statistics allowed to not only identify the overall model recovery, but also to quantify the recovery of spatial structures.},

Spatially distributed models represent one of the main options, alongside satellite remote sensing, to successfully monitor this quantity over large areas in a cost effective way. This work has the double aim of: (i) intercomparing three soil moisture outputs obtained by different land-surface models (LISFOOD, CLM and TESSEL) through long (at least 6 years of data between 2001 and 2011) in-situ measured datastreams, and (ii) quantifying the added value of combining the estimates of these three models by means of a simple ensemble approach. Generally, the three models return similar soil moisture anomalies over most of Europe, with few notable exceptions during summer in Mediterranean regions. The comparison with in-situ data suggests no substantial differences among the models, with LISFLOOD slightly outperforming the other two in terms of correlation as also supported by a pairwise comparison. The combined soil moisture anomalies obtained via the ensemble-mean approach are characterized by an increase of both the correlation and the accuracy in retrieving extreme events compared to the single models; however, the number of observed extreme events actually captured by the ensemble model does not increase significantly if compared to the single models. Overall, the ensemble model results are skillful, with an all site average skill score of about 0.4. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Richards' equation (RE) is the most common mathematical expression for soil water movement in a porous medium. Despite advancements in numerical schemes and high-performance computing, the requirements of iterative computations and fine grids hinder further extension of the RE to multi-dimensional and large-scale applications. Averaging methods of hydraulic conductivity have been known to be one of the significant factors affecting the accuracy of numerical solutions of the RE, especially when coarse grids are used. In this study, we developed a high-order averaging method of hydraulic conductivity for accurate numerical modeling of the RE, which has a straightforward formula regardless of the soil conditions and produces high simulation accuracy when used on coarse grids. The developed method is based on the high-order upwind scheme, which is widely used for hyperbolic partial differential equations within a finite volume framework in order to prevent numerical oscillations near a discontinuity while preserving high-order accuracy. Numerical simulations of several one- and two-dimensional cases performed in the study indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing simple averaging methods and is also superior, or at least equivalent, to complex averaging methods over a wide range of soil textures, especially on coarse grids. In addition, the proposed method is straightforwardly extended to nonorthogonal grids by being combined with the coordinate transformation method and the extension is verified through multi-dimensional test cases as well as tests on a heterogeneous soil domain.

In this study, we construct a novel method based on Bayesian data fusion to up scale in situ SM observations to the coarse scale of microwave remote sensing. In the framework of Bayesian theory, the valuable auxiliary information obtained in Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) apparent thermal inertia (ATI) is integrated into the upscaling process. The method is validated using SM wireless sensor network data in the Tibetan plateau, which covers an area of approximately 30 x 30 km(2) with 20 in situ stations. Results confirm that the upscaled SM using the method with randomly selected three stations from the 20 stations is extremely close to the mean of the 20 SMs. The mean root mean square error (RMSE) between the upscaled SM and the mean of the 20 in situ SMs was 0.02 m(3) m(-3), and the max RMSE was less than 0.05 m(3) m(-3). Furthermore, the sensitivity of the upscaling accuracy to the number of in situ observations is discussed. When the number of in situ observations is greater than nine, the increasing accuracy of the Bayesian method is limited by the uncertainty in the ATI of the remote sensing.},

Early assessment of soil moisture reserves, and monitoring of changes in available soil moisture, could assist in risk reduction strategies for the agriculture sector and effective delivery of government programs. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada has been acquiring RADARSAT-2 data since 2008 to evaluate the accuracy with which this sensor can provide soil moisture to assist with implementing risk reduction strategies for the Canadian agriculture sector. The calibrated Integral Equation Model (IEM) was used to estimate soil moisture for 15 RADARSAT-2 data sets acquired over an eastern and western Canadian test site. Using this approach, field level soil moisture was estimated to a mean average error of 7.95\%, although considerable scatter in the results was observed. Removing fields which had significant residue cover improved site specific soil moisture errors, but only for the fall campaign prior to spring tillage and seed bed preparation. Higher errors were also observed for data sets where angles between the RADARSAT-2 look direction and field tillage structures were largest. When soil moisture estimates were evaluated at a regional scale, mean errors fell to 3.14\%. The IEM was also able to detect increases and decreases in soil moisture which followed periods of rainfall and drying.},

This research aimed to overcome the failure of radar sensor in SMAP satellite as well as the failure to generate the radar/radiometer combined SMC product at a spatial resolution of 9 km x 9 km. A disaggregation technique, based on the Smoothing Filter based Intensity Modulation (SFIM), enabled us to obtain co-located SMAP and AMSR2 brightness measurements at L, C, X, Ku and Ka bands at approximately 10 km x 10 km on the selected test area, which corresponds to the entire Italian territory. These disaggregated microwave data were used as inputs of the “HydroAlgo” retrieval algorithm based on Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), which were able to exploit the synergy between radiometric acquisitions from these two sensors. The algorithm was defined, implemented and tested using all the overlapping orbits of SMAP and AMSR2 over Italy throughout the 9\_month period between April and December 2015. Distributed SMC reference values for implementing and validating the algorithm were obtained from the Soil Water Balance hydrological model, SWBM. Through HydroAlgo, an SMC product at a resolution of approximately 10 km x 10 km was obtained. This result is close to the original Radar/Radiometer SMC product from SMAP, with an average correlation coefficient R {\textgreater} 0.75 and RMSE congruent to 0.03 m(3)/m(3), in both ascending and descending orbits.},

	abstract = {Understanding soil moisture spatial variability (SMSV) at regional scales is of great value for various purposes; however, relevant studies are still limited and have yielded inconsistent findings about the primary controls on regional SMSV. To further address this issue, long-term soil moisture data were retrieved from two large scale monitoring networks located in the continental United States, including the Michigan Automated Weather Network and the Oklahoma Mesonet. To evaluate different controls on SMSV, supporting datasets, which contained data on climate, soil, topography, and vegetation, were also compiled from various sources. Based on temporal stability analysis, the results showed that the mean relative difference (MRD) of soil moisture was more correlated with soil texture (e.g., negative correlations between MRD and sand fraction, and positive ones between LAIRD and silt and clay fractions) than with meteorological forcings in both regions, which differed from the traditional notion that meteorological forcings were the dominant controls on regional SMSV. Moreover, the results revealed that contrary to the previous conjecture, the use of soil moisture temporal anomaly did not reduce the impacts of static properties (e.g., soil properties) on soil moisture temporal dynamics. Instead, it was found that the magnitude of soil moisture temporal anomaly was mainly negatively correlated with sand fraction and positively with silt and clay fractions in both regions. Finally, the relationship between the spatial average and standard deviation of soil moisture as well as soil moisture temporal anomaly was investigated using the data from both networks. The field data showed that the relationship for both soil moisture and soil moisture temporal anomaly was more affected by soil texture than by climatic conditions (e.g., precipitation). The results of this study provided strong field evidence that local factors (e.g., soil properties) might outweigh regional factors (e.g., meteorological forcings) in controlling regional SMSV.

To develop an accurate interpolation of the in situ readings that can be used to produce distributed representations of soil moisture (SM) and energy balances at the landscape scale for remote sensing studies, we studied (1) the temporal and spatial variations of ground temperature (GT) and infra red temperature (IRT) within 30 by 30 m plots around selected network stations; (2) the relationship between the readings from the eight 30 by 30 m plots and the point reading of the network stations for the variables SM, GT and IRT; and (3) the spatial and temporal variation of GT and IRT within agriculture landuses: grass, orchard, peanuts, cotton and bare soil in the surrounding landscape. The results showed high correlations between the station readings and the adjacent 30 by 30 m plot average value for SM; high seasonal independent variation in the GT and IRT behavior among the eight 30 by 30 m plots; and site specific, in-field homogeneity in each 30 by 30 m plot. We found statistical differences in the GT and IRT between the different landuses as well as high correlations between GT and IRT regardless of the landuse. Greater standard deviations for IRT than for GT (in the range of 2-4) were found within the 30 by 30 m, suggesting that when a single point reading for this variable is selected for the validation of either remote sensing data or water-energy models, errors may occur. The results confirmed that in this landscape homogeneous 30 by 30 m plots can be used as landscape spatial units for soil moisture and ground temperature studies. Under this landscape conditions small plots can account for local expressions of environmental processes, decreasing the errors and uncertainties in remote sensing estimates caused by landscape heterogeneity.

	abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) is an important factor that affects agricultural development in arid regions. Compared with the space-borne remote sensing system, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely used because of its stronger controllability and higher resolution. It also provides a more convenient method for monitoring SMC than normal measurement methods that includes field sampling and oven-drying techniques. However, research based on UAV hyperspectral data has not yet formed a standard procedure in arid regions. Therefore, a universal processing scheme is required. We hypothesized that combining pretreatments of UAV hyperspectral imagery under optimal indices and a set of field observations within a machine learning framework will yield a highly accurate estimate of SMC. Optimal 2D spectral indices act as indispensable variables and allow us to characterize a model's SMC performance and spatial distribution. For this purpose, we used hyperspectral imagery and a total of 70 topsoil samples (0-10 cm) from the farmland (2.5 x 10(4) m(2)) of Fukang City, Xinjiang Uygur AutonomousRegion, China. The random forest (RF) method and extreme learning machine (ELM) were used to estimate the SMC using six methods of pretreatments combined with four optimal spectral indices. The validation accuracy of the estimated method clearly increased compared with that of linear models. The combination of pretreatments and indices by our assessment effectively eliminated the interference and the noises. Comparing two machine learning algorithms showed that the RF models were superior to the ELM models, and the best model was PIR (R-val(2)= 0.907, RMSEP = 1.477, and RPD = 3.396). The SMC map predicted via the best scheme was highly similar to the SMC map measured. We conclude that combining preprocessed spectral indices and machine learning algorithms allows estimation of SMC with high accuracy (R-val(2) = 0.907) via UAV hyperspectral imagery on a regional scale. Ultimately, our program might improve management and conservation strategies for agroecosystem systems in arid regions.},

The modeled soil moisture drought indices were verified against the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), which served as a reference drought indicator over northern China (NC), northwestern China (NWC), and southwestern China (SWC) from 1961 to 2010. The results show that the precipitation forcing data that drive both LSMs have high accuracy when compared with local observational data. GLDASv2/Noah outperforms CABLE in capturing soil moisture anomalies and variability, especially in SWC, but both show good correlations with the 3-month SPEI (SPEI3) in NC, NWC, and SWC. The autumn drought of 2002 and spring drought of 2010 were selected for the comparison of the modeled drought categories with the SPEI3 drought category, where GLDASv2/Noah performed slightly better than CABLE. This work demonstrates that the choice of LSM is crucial for monitoring soil moisture drought and that the GLDASv2/Noah LSM can be a good candidate for the development of a new operational drought-monitoring system in China.},

Currently, even with improved spatial and temporal resolutions of numerical model, verification methods for soil moisture data still rely on the traditional intensity verification parameters, such as mean error (ME) and root-mean-squared error (RMSE). Those methods provide only incomplete and sometimes inaccurate messages and thus hinder a proper evaluation of a forecast model. The SAL method is an object-based regional verification method with respect to precipitation forecasts. Based on the SAL method, a novel object-based method (SAL-DN) is proposed here, which can be used to test regional soil moisture. Both the ideal experiment and real experiment show that the SAL-DN method can reveal the differences between the observed and forecast soil moisture in three aspects: structure, amplitude, and location, and the results can reflect the actual situation. Furthermore, compared with the SAL method, the SAL-DN method is also capable of verifying physical quantities with high-value and low-value centers like temperature. Therefore, the SAL-DN method enhances verification accuracy and can be applied widely.},

SMOS soil moisture products obtained from two versions (ascending and descending) were included. The evaluations were carried out at both network and site scales. According to the validation results, the ECV products outperformed the SMOS products at both scales. Comparing the two versions of the SMOS products, the SMOS ascending product generally performed better than the SMOS descending product and obtained comparable accuracy to the ECV product at Kyeamba and Yanco sites. However, the SMOS ascending performed poorly at the Adelong sites. Moreover, the ECV product has less data gaps than the SMOS products, because the ECV products were developed by combining passive and active microwave products. Consequently, the results in this study show that the combined ECV product is recommended, as both accuracy and integrity of the soil moisture product are important. The SMOS ascending product is recommended between the two overpass versions of SMOS products.},

Currently, the USDA IPAD estimates surface and root-zone soil moisture using a two-layer modified Palmer soil moisture model forced by global precipitation and temperature measurements. However, this approach suffers from well-known errors arising from uncertainty in model forcing data and highly simplified model physics. Here, we attempt to correct for these errors by designing and applying an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation system to integrate surface soil moisture retrievals from the NASA Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) into the USDA modified Palmer soil moisture model. An assessment of soil moisture analysis products produced from this assimilation has been completed for a five-year (2002 to 2007) period over the North American continent between 23 degrees N-50 degrees N and 128 degrees W-65 degrees W. In particular, a data denial experimental approach is utilized to isolate the added utility of integrating remotely sensed soil moisture by comparing EnKF soil moisture results obtained using (relatively) low-quality precipitation products obtained from real-time satellite imagery to baseline Palmer model runs forced with higher quality rainfall. An analysis of root-zone anomalies for each model simulation suggests that the assimilation of AMSR-E surface soil moisture retrievals can add significant value to USDA root-zone predictions derived from real-time satellite precipitation products.},

	abstract = {Estimation of root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) at regional scales is a critical issue in surface hydrology that could be a great help for estimating evapotranspiration, erosion, runoff, and irrigation requirements, etc. A significant number of satellites [soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS), special sensor microwave imager (SSM/ I), advanced microwave scanning radiometer-EOS (AMSR-E), tropical rainfall measuring mission/ microwave imager (TRMM/ TMI), etc.] retrieve surface soil moisture (SSM) using passive microwave remote sensing. This information can be used to derive RZSM using a new mathematical filter. In particular, the recently developed soil moisture analytical relationship (SMAR) can relate the surface soil moisture to the moisture of deeper layer using a relationship derived from a soil water balance equation where infiltration is estimated based on the relative fluctuations of soil moisture in the surface soil layer. In the present paper, the SMAR model is tested on two research databases in Africa and North America [African monsoon multidisciplinary analysis (AMMA) and soil climate analysis network (SCAN), respectively], where field measurements at different depths are available. Furthermore, the TRMM/ TMI Satellite is selected to retrieve the satellite SSM data of the studied regions using the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). Both remotely sensed SSM and field measurements are used within the SMAR model to explore their ability in reproducing the RZSM and also to explore the existing difference in model parameterization moving from one dataset to the other. The SMAR model is applied using three different schemes: (1) with parameters calibrated using surface field measurements, (2) with parameters calibrated using remotely sensed SSM as input, and finally (3) using the remotely sensed SSM with the same parameters calibrated in Scheme 1. In all cases, SMAR parameters have been calibrated using a genetic algorithm optimizing the root-mean square error (RMSE) between SMAR prediction and measured RZSM. The results show that remotely sensed data may be coupled with the SMAR model to provide a good description of RZSM dynamics, but it requires a specific parameterization respect to Scheme 1. Nevertheless, it is surprising to observe that two of the four parameters of the model related to the soil texture are relatively stable moving from remote-sensed to field data.

The 5-day soil moisture observed at 167 stations and daily temperature recorded at 33 stations during the period of 2010-2014 were used in the current work. Model performance was tested with accuracy indicators of determination coefficient (R-2), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE), relative root mean square error (RRMSE), and modeling efficiency (ME). The results indicated that inverse distance weighting had the best performance with R2, MAPE, RMSE, RRMSE, and ME of 0.32, 14.37, 13.02\%, 0.16, and 0.30, respectively. Based on the best method, a spatial database of soil moisture was developed and used to investigate drought condition over the study area. The results showed that the distribution of drought was characterized by evidently regional difference. Besides, drought mainly occurred in August and September in the 5 years and was prone to happening in the western and central parts rather than in the northeastern and southeastern areas.},

Considering locations that have significant correlations for each 3-year sub periods within 1980-2010, averaged soil moisture correlations of SM-MW with ERA-Land (at 95\% Confidence Interval) are increasing steadily from 1986 to 2010 (from 0.52 +/- 0.10, to 0.66 +/- 0.04). The lower correlations mirror the periods where only passive microwave from the Special Sensor Microwave/Image (SSM/I Ku band at 19.3 GHz) sensor was used, highlighting the importance of multi-sensor capabilities. Overall SM-MW is relatively stable over time with respect to ERA-Land. Good agreement is obtained in semi-arid areas, whilst the tropics and high latitudes (and altitudes) present lower correlations values. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Detailed information on the temporal and spatial evolution of soil moisture patterns is of fundamental importance to improve runoff prediction, optimize irrigation management and to enhance crop forecasting. However, obtaining representative soil moisture measurements at the catchment scale is challenging because of the dynamic spatial and temporal behavior of soil moisture. High-resolution remote sensing data provide detailed spatial information about catchment characteristics (e. g., terrain and land use) that can be used as proxies to estimate soil moisture. We assessed the potential use of combined multitemporal multispectral remote sensing (RS) and terrain data for estimating spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale. The fuzzy c-means sampling and estimation approach (FCM SEA) was applied to conduct a sensor (proxy) directed (guided) sampling and to reconstruct multitemporal soil moisture patterns based on time domain reflectometry measurements. A comprehensive soil moisture database for the Schafertal catchment, located in central Germany, was used to test, validate, and compare the FCM SEA performances of the combined remote sensing data with those of a benchmark approach driven solely by terrain data. Results from the study show that a FCM SEA model that integrates bi-temporal RS imagery and terrain data was more effective in estimating spatial soil moisture patterns relative to the benchmark model. It outperformed the benchmark model in 58\% of the cases and was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed variance for a range of different catchment moisture conditions. This was achieved with only a small sample size (n = 30). The results of this study are promising because they highlight the importance of considering multitemporal RS and terrain data and demonstrate how in situ sensors can be optimally placed to enable cost-efficient monitoring and prediction of spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale.},

The approach is based on semi-empirical relationships between soil moisture and the polarized reflectivity including the effect of the vegetation optical depth which is parameterized as a function of the normalized vegetation difference index (NDVI). The method was tested against in situ measurements collected over a grass site from 2004 to 2007 (SMOSREX experiment). Two polarizations (horizontal/vertical) and five incidence angles (20 degrees, 30 degrees, 40 degrees, 50 degrees, and 60 degrees) were considered in the analysis. The best w(S) estimations were obtained when using both polarizations at an angle of 40 degrees. The average accuracy in the soil moisture retrievals was found to be approximately 0.06 m3/m3, improving the estimations by 0.02 m3/m3 with respect to the case in which the vegetation effect is not considered. The results indicate that information on vegetation (through a vegetation index such as NDVI) is useful for the estimation of soil moisture through the semi-empirical regressions.},

Furthermore, surface soil conductive heat transfer equation of two-layer model is used to solve the soil thermal inertia so that the remote sensing thermal inertia method can be applied to regions with better-covered vegetation, but usually only for the bare areas or worse vegetation covered areas.

The 4-yr operational period of SMOS was wetter than the 30-yr climate normal in many locations, particularly in the late summer for most regions and in the spring for the province of Manitoba. This leads to a somewhat unrepresentative baseline that skews anomaly measures at different parts of the growing season. SMOS soil moisture does, however, show a clear trend where extremes are present, with drier-than-average conditions during periods that drought and dry soil risks were identified and wetter-than-average conditions when flooding and excess moisture were present. Areas where extreme weather events caused crop losses were identifiable using SMOS soil moisture, both at the provincial and regional scales. The variability in soil moisture between at-risk areas and normal areas is very small but consistent, both geographically and over time, making SMOS a good real-time indicator for risk assessment.},

The method merges the five parts into a cost function, i.e., the differences of wind, potential temperature, and specific humidity gradient between observations and those computed by the profile method, the difference of latent heat fluxes calculated using the ECMWF land surface evaporation scheme and the profile method, and a weak constraint for surface energy balance. By using an optimal algorithm, the best solutions are found. The method is tested with the data collected at Feixi Station (31.41 degrees N, 117.08 degrees E) supported by the China Heavy Rain Experiment and Study (HeRES) during 7-30 June 2001. The results show that estimated near-surface soil moistures can quickly respond to rainfall, and their temporal variation is consistent with that of measurements of average soil moisture over 15-cm top depth with a maximum error less than 0.03 m(3) m(-3). The surface heat fluxes calculated by this method are consistent with those by the Bowen ratio method, but at the same time it can overcome the instability problem occurring in the Bowen ratio method when the latter is about -1. Meanwhile, the variational method is more accurate than the profile method in terms of satisfying the surface energy balance. The sensitivity tests also show that the variational method is the most stable one among the three methods.},

By applying Fourier analysis to the time-series observations from the space-borne passive microwave sensors, this paper proposes a method to extract the high-frequency part of the satellite observed signals that reflect the soil moisture changes and help to generate the historical soil moisture datasets with an improved accuracy. The method is applied to the observations from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). Validations using field sampled soil moisture from two watersheds in the U.S. indicate that the method can effectively improve the sensitivity of current National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) soil moisture products to the temporal changes of the surface soil moisture, with the correlation coefficients of the retrievals and measurements increased from 0.462 to 0.595 and 0.403 to 0.613 for the two watersheds, respectively.

	abstract = {Although many methods of soil moisture measurement exist, there remains a lack of soil moisture sensor with small volume, high precision, excellent real-time performance and distributed monitoring capability. In this paper, a fiber Bragg grating (FBG)-based carbon fiber heated sensor (CFHS) that can overcome the deficiencies in soil moisture movement is proposed. The CFHS consists of a carbon fiber rod with a diameter of 5 mm, quas-distributed FBG sensors on an optical fiber, a coating, two binding posts, and two electric cables. Laboratory calibration tests have been conducted to establish an empirical piece-wise relationship between the temperature characteristic value and soil moisture for sand, silt and clay. A laboratory validation test under normal gravity and a centrifuge test under overweight conditions, have been performed to verify the feasibility of this technique for soil moisture monitoring. The test results show that the CFHS can (i) accurately record soil moisture under normal gravitational and overweight conditions and (ii) track the evolution of capillary zones, and the generation and migration of moisture transition zones under centrifuge acceleration. During a response period of 5 min, the accuracy is 0.033m(3)/m(3) under 1 g condition, and 0.047m(3)/m(3) under overweight condition. With the advantages of small sensor size, low disturbance of soil mass and wide adaptability in physical model tests, the proposed method can achieve distributed soil moisture measurement at different scales and with high efficiency.},

In this study we aimed to find a more accurate and cost effective method for measuring moisture content than manual field sampling. Locations of 25 sampling points were chosen from our research field as a reference. We assumed that soil moisture content could be calculated by measuring apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) using the Veris-3100 on-the-go soil mapping tool. Statistical analysis was carried out on the 10.791 ECa raw data in order to filter the outliers. The applied statistical method was +/- 1.5 interquartile (IRQ) distance approach. The visualization of soil moisture distribution within the experimental field was carried out by means of ArcGIS/ArcMAP using the inverse distance weighting interpolation method. In the investigated 25 sampling points, coefficient of determination between calculated volumetric moisture content data and measured ECa was R-2 = 0.87. According to our results, volumetric moisture content can be mapped by applying ECa measurements in these particular soil types.},

The sensor is manufactured using a conventional printed circuit board and includes a porous ceramic. To read the sensor, we use a circuit that includes a 10 kHz triangle wave generator, an AC amplifier, a precision rectifier and a microcontroller. In terms of performance, the sensor's capacitance ( measured in a laboratory prototype) increases up to 5\% when the volumetric water content of the porous ceramic changed from 3\% to 36\%, resulting in a sensitivity of S = 15.5 pF per unity change. Repeatability tests for capacitance measurement showed that the theta(v) sensor's root mean square error is 0.13\%. The average current consumption of the system ( sensor and signal conditioning circuit) is less than 1.5 mu A, which demonstrates its suitability for being powered by energy harvesting systems. We developed a complete irrigation control system that integrates the sensor, an energy harvesting module composed of a microgenerator installed on the top of a micro sprinkler spinner, and a DC/ DC converter circuit that charges a 1 F supercapacitor. The energy harvesting module operates only when the micro sprinkler spinner is irrigating the soil, and the supercapacitor is fully charged to 5 V in about 3 h during the first irrigation. After the first irrigation, with the supercap fully charged, the system can operate powered only by the supercapacitor for approximately 23 days, without any energy being harvested.},

The microsensors are exposed to different levels of relative humidity (\% RH) ranging from 40 to 90\% and various moisture contents of bentonite and redsoils. It is observed that the microsensors resistance decreases with increase in humidity (\% RH) and gravimetric soil moisture contents (red and bentonite), respectively. The sensor exhibited a sensitivityof 4.6 K Omega / 0.1\% change in RH. Further, sensitivities of 7.5 and 12.2 Omega/ 0.1\% change in gravimetric water content when exposed to bentonite and red soil samples respectively were achieved. The low cost, goodre producibility, repeatability and good stability with time indicated that PVA modified ZnO NW hetero structure microsensors platform is potentially useful for measurement of humidity and soil moisture contents in agriculture applications.

Today, there is a need also to confirm the theoretical approaches of the kinematic wave approximation with the real field measurements. Within a research project dedicated to the model-based description of runoff formation processes, field measurements of soil moisture dynamics and numerical simulation, using one simply formulated kinematic wave model, are combined. It is shown that the measurement of the soil moisture movement downwards within a hillslope can be interpreted by the kinematic wave model and vice versa how the model can be validated in its physical explanations by the field measurements. It is revealed that the soil moisture fluxes can be described by kinematic waves crossing the soil mantle of the hillslope. Based on these analyses it is shown that the two topographic characteristics plane and profile curvatures of the hillslope control the subsurface and saturation flow.

There are two patterns of water extraction distribution during the development of banana and the point of installation of sensors for irrigation management inside the zone of highest root activity is not constant along the crop development.},

	abstract = {Limited water supplies in arid regions put constraints on agriculture. In arid New Mexico, greenhouse chile pepper production has the potential for water and nutrient savings. The objectives of this study were to (1) compare two capacitance sensors - (Hydra probes and 5TM) and one TDR CS616 sensor, (2) compute actual evapotranspiration (ETa) for drip-irrigated chile peppers for three water treatments, and (3) develop new crop coefficients (K-c) for the three growing seasons in a greenhouse study. Three water treatments were (1) control where water was applied near the surface using two drip emitters, (2) partial root zone drying vertical (PRDv) where subsurface irrigation was applied at 20 cm depth from soil surface, and (3) partial root zone drying compartment (PRDc) where roots were divided into two compartments and irrigation were switched between compartments after 15 days. Sensor-generated volumetric water contents (theta) were correlated with the gravimetrically determined theta, and the new calibration coefficients improved the precision of theta estimates. From 2011 onward, irrigation amounts were adjusted to minimize deep percolation, and about 30\% less water was applied in 2014 as compared to the 2011 growing season but no significant differences were observed in transpiration rate and leaf temperature. The ratio of intercellular to ambient CO2 concentrations (Ci/Ca) was significantly correlated to transpiration rate and vapor pressure deficit in 2014 (P {\textless} 0.05). ETa obtained from water balance and reference ET (ETr) from Penman-Monteith developed the K-c for drip-irrigated greenhouse chile peppers for three growing seasons. The maximum values of K-c were about 1.4 during 2013 and 1.2 during 2014. The 2011 growing season was shorter and the maximum K-c were closer to one. Crop coefficients for greenhouse grown chile peppers varied with growing seasons and irrigation treatment. Irrigation scheduling can be done based on the soil moisture or K-c for the known growing season. This study demonstrated the water saving potential of PRD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The modified calibration significantly improves model estimation of soil moisture. Specifically, we find an 18\% reduction in unbiased root-mean-squared differences in the north of Ghana and a 21\% reduction in the south of Ghana for a 5-year hindcast after assimilating a single year of soil moisture observations to update model parameters. The use of an improved remotely sensed rainfall dataset contributes to 6\% of this reduction in deviation for northern Ghana and 10\% for southern Ghana. Improved rainfall data have the greatest impact on model estimates during the seasonal wetting-up of soil, with the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture having greatest impact during dryingdown. In the north of Ghana we are able to recover improved estimates of soil texture after data assimilation. However, we are unable to do so for the south. The significant reduction in unbiased root-mean-squared difference we find after assimilating a single year of observations bodes well for the production of improved land surface model soil moisture estimates over sub-Saharan Africa.},

	abstract = {Many studies have shown the deficiencies of the extended Kalman filter (EKF), even though it has become a standard technique used in nonlinear estimation. In the EKF method, the state distribution is propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system, which can introduce large errors in variable estimation and may lead to suboptimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) addresses these problems using a deterministic sampling approach to capture the posterior mean and covariance accurate to the third order for any nonlinearity, while the dual-UKF method uses two UKF filters (one for state variables and one for parameters, in contrast to only one filter in the usual UKF) to simultaneously optimize the model states and parameters using observational data. In this paper, we employ the dual-UKF method to account for the effects of land surface subgrid-scale heterogeneity and soil water thawing and freezing and implement it into the NCAR Community Land Model version 2.0 to build a data assimilation system for assimilating satellite observations of soil moisture. Experiments for two sites in north and south China show that this dual-UKF-based assimilation system outperforms the usual UKF- and EKF-based methods in reproducing the temporal evolution of daily soil moisture, especially under freezing conditions. Furthermore, the improvement also propagates, albeit to a lesser extent, to lower layers where observations are unavailable.},

The initial goal of the experiments cited was to find out if SMSs could reduce irrigation water application as compared to typical residential irrigation systems without sensor feedback. The effect of different threshold settings and irrigation frequencies on water application and turf quality was also evaluated Other research goals included evaluating the consistency of different SMS units and their precision in measuring soil water content (theta). Results on turfgrass plots showed that a 7 days per week (d week(-1)) irrigation frequency significantly reduced the water applied compared to 1 and 2 d week(-1) scheduled frequencies. During rainy periods, the SMSs tested reduced irrigation by 42\% to 72\% on average, depending on specific testing conditions, while maintaining good turf quality. During dry periods, the average savings decreased to -1\% to 64\%, and the resultant turf quality was sometimes below the minimum acceptable level. Therefore, under sustained thy weather conditions or in dry climates, the run times, irrigation frequency, and/or low threshold settings should be carefully considered. Results showed that SMSs from Acclima and Rain Bird were more consistent and precise in measuring soil water content and saved more water than Water Watcher and Irrometer units. Under residential conditions, SMSs decreased the water application by 65\% compared to homes with automated irrigation systems without sensor feedback. Overall research results clearly demonstrate that the use of SMSs in Florida, when properly installed, set, and maintained, could lead to significant irrigation water savings while maintaining turf quality at or above the minimum acceptable rating.},

The spectrophotometer optical unit was attached to the subsoiler chisel backside to perform the light reflectance measurement from the soil surface on the bottom of the trench opened by the proceeded chisel. The spectrophotometer-optical unit system was calibrated for to under stationary laboratory conditions on samples collected from an Arenic Cambisol field with different soil textures. A partial least square analysis was carried out in order to establish a statistical model relating soil light spectra with the gravimetric W of the 0.005-0.26 kg kg(-1) range. This model was validated with the full cross validation method resulting in a small root mean square error of cross validation (RMSECV) of 0.0175 kg kg(-1) and a high validation correlation of 0.978. Further validation of the model developed in the laboratory under stationary state showed also a small root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) of 0.0165 kg kg(-1) and a prediction correlation of 0.982. When the NIR sensor-model system was used to determine w. based on on-line field measurement, a relatively larger RMSEP of 0.025 kg kg(-1) and lower prediction correlation of 0.75 were found. However, a reasonably similar spatial distribution of W was found between the on-line NIR measurement and oven drying methods. Therefore. the on-line NIR to sensor developed is recommended to provide valuable information towards the site-specific applications in soils. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The prediction of the spatial and temporal variability of land surface states and fluxes with land surface models at high spatial resolution is still a challenge. This study compares simulation results using TerrSysMP including a 3D variably saturated groundwater flow model (ParFlow) coupled to the Community Land Model (CLM) of a 38 ha managed grassland head-water catchment in the Eifel (Germany), with soil water content (SWC) measurements from a wireless sensor network, actual evapotranspiration recorded by lysimeters and eddy covariance stations and discharge observations. TerrSysMP was discretized with a 10 x 10 m lateral resolution, variable vertical resolution (0.025-0.575 m), and the following parameterization strategies of the subsurface soil hydraulic parameters: (i) completely homogeneous, (ii) homogeneous parameters for different soil horizons, (iii) different parameters for each soil unit and soil horizon and (iv) heterogeneous stochastic realizations. Hydraulic conductivity and Mualem-Van Genuchten parameters in these simulations were sampled from probability density functions, constructed from either (i) soil texture measurements and Rosetta pedotransfer functions (ROS), or (ii) estimated soil hydraulic parameters by 1D inverse modelling using shuffle complex evolution (SCE). The results indicate that the spatial variability of SWC at the scale of a small headwater catchment is dominated by topography and spatially heterogeneous soil hydraulic parameters. The spatial variability of the soil water content thereby increases as a function of heterogeneity of soil hydraulic parameters. For lower levels of complexity, spatial variability of the SWC was underrepresented in particular for the ROS-simulations. Whereas all model simulations were able to reproduce the seasonal evapotranspiration variability, the poor discharge simulations with high model bias are likely related to short-term ET dynamics and the lack of information about bedrock characteristics and an on-site drainage system in the uncalibrated model. In general, simulation performance was better for the SCE setups. The SCE simulations had a higher inverse air entry parameter resulting in SWC dynamics in better correspondence with data than the ROS simulations during dry periods. This illustrates that small scale measurements of soil hydraulic parameters cannot be transferred to the larger scale and that interpolated 1D inverse parameter estimates result in an acceptable performance for the catchment.

The probe directly measures the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum and for this purpose requires three calibration media: air, water, and ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to study the influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as a verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soilssandy loam and two silt loamswith six water contents from air-dry to saturation. The conversion from {\textless}mml:semantics{\textgreater}S11{\textless}/mml:semantics{\textgreater} parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid procedure. The simulation and measurement results for the real part of the isopropanol dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers with different diameters were in good agreement with literature data up to 200 MHz. The real part of the dielectric permittivity was extracted and related to the moisture of the tested soil samples. Relations between the volumetric water content and the real part of the dielectric permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by TDR) were compared with Topp's equation. It was concluded that the best fit to Topp's equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data calculated according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and Roth gave results closer to Topp's calibration. The obtained results indicated that the seven-rod probe can be used to accurately measure of the dielectric permittivity spectrum in a well-defined sample volume of about 8 cm(3) in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 200 MHz.},

The objective of this study is to develop a low-cost soil moisture sensor using capacitors on a film substrate and a capacitive touch integrated circuit. The performance of the sensor was evaluated in two field experiments: a grape field and a mizuna greenhouse field. The developed sensor captured dynamic changes in soil moisture at 10, 20, and 30 cm depth, with a period of 10-14 days required after sensor installation for the contact between capacitors and soil to settle down. The measured soil moisture showed the influence of individual sensor differences, and the influence masked minor differences of less than 0.05 m(3).m(-3) in the soil moisture at different locations. However, the developed sensor could detect large differences of more than 0.05 m(3).m(-3), as well as the different magnitude of changes, in soil moisture. The price of the developed sensor was reduced to 300 U.S. dollars and can be reduced even more by further improvements suggested in this study and by mass production. Therefore, the developed sensor will be made more affordable to farmers as it requires low financial investment, and it can be utilized for decision-making in irrigation.},

	abstract = {Mining affects the environment in different ways depending on the physical context in which the mining occurs. In mining areas with an arid environment, mining affects plants' growth by changing the amount of available water. This paper discusses the effects of mining on two important determinants of plant growth-soil moisture and groundwater table (GWT)-which were investigated using an integrated approach involving a field sampling investigation with remote sensing (RS) and ground-penetrating radar (GPR). To calculate and map the distribution of soil moisture for a target area, we initially analyzed four models for regression analysis between soil moisture and apparent thermal inertia and finally selected a linear model for modeling the soil moisture at a depth 10 cm; the relative error of the modeled soil moisture was about 6.3\% and correlation coefficient 0.7794. A comparison of mined and unmined areas based on the results of limited field sampling tests or RS monitoring of Landsat 5-thermatic mapping (TM) data indicated that soil moisture did not undergo remarkable changes following mining. This result indicates that mining does not have an effect on soil moisture in the Shendong coal mining area. The coverage of vegetation in 2005 was compared with that in 1995 by means of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) deduced from TM data, and the results showed that the coverage of vegetation in Shendong coal mining area has improved greatly since 1995 because of policy input RMBAyen0.4 per ton coal production by Shendong Coal Mining Company. The factor most affected by coal mining was GWT, which dropped from a depth of 35.41 m before mining to a depth of 43.38 m after mining at the Bulianta Coal Mine based on water well measurements. Ground-penetrating radar at frequencies of 25 and 50 MHz revealed that the deepest GWT was at about 43.4 m. There was a weak water linkage between the unsaturated zone and groundwater, and the decline of water table primarily resulted from the well pumping for mining safety rather than the movement of cracking strata. This result is in agreement with the measurements of the water wells. The roots of nine typical plants in the study area were investigated. Populus was found to have the deepest root system with a depth of about 26 m. Based on an assessment of plant growth demands and the effect of mining on environmental factors, we concluded that mining will have less of an effect on plant growth at those sites where the primary GWT depth before mining was deep enough to be unavailable to plants. If the primary GWT was available for plant growth before mining, especially to those plants with deeper roots, mining will have a significant effect on the growth of plants and the mechanism of this effect will include the loss of water to roots and damage to the root system.},

We used both laboratory and field experiment to describe the electrical signal with a focus on soil water content. Our objective was to determine in which hydric state of the soil, and related electrical properties, roots could be accurately discriminated. We hypothesized that preferential water zone absorption near the roots could, in some conditions, contribute to locate them. During the laboratory experiments, we compared the response of containers filled with the same homogeneous silty clay bare material, and without (A) or with freshly cut root (B) at different levels of soil water content. Resistivity and phase variations with soil water content indicated that it was preferable to work in dry conditions since the contrast was higher. Interactions and overlapping between polarization effects of both root and soil made it difficult to interpret first chargeability maps. This led us to study temporal-spatial variations by considering the dynamics of water absorption during a field experiment. High resolution time lapses images showed a correlation between root location and complex resistivity anomalies. Although these first results have to be confirmed by further measurements, induced polarization seems to add useful information to interpret anomalies produced by woody roots. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Responses were measured in three zones based on distance from shade and water (Zone 1, 0-8 m; Zone 2, 8-16 m; Zone 3, {\textgreater}16 m). Indices were calculated to weight number of dung and urine events and time spent by cattle in a zone by the proportion of the total pasture and paddock area represented by that zone. Indices were most uniform (similar to 1) across zones for rotational stocking with short grazing periods and generally increased linearly in Zones 1 and 2 with increasing grazing period. Except for N, soil nutrient concentration was not affected by stocking method. In zones closest to shade and water, soil nutrients accumulated for all methods in the surface 8 cm but not in the 8- to 23-cm layer. Air temperature, wind speed, and temperature-humidity index explained 49\% of the variation in time cattle spent under shade, confirming the importance of the environment in animal behavior.

To evaluate the application and accuracy of the method for SWC observation in an alpine meadow ecosystem (AME), we installed the CRNS in a flat meadow near the Naqu prefecture on the northern Tibetan Plateau. We collecting soil samples and applying the system by the oven-drying method. A weather station was also installed near the CRNS for monitoring basic meteorological variables and the soil temperature and water content at various depths. Three Em-50 instruments for monitoring SWC and soil temperature were buried in three sub-quadrats northwest, northeast and southeast of the CRNS at distances of 460, 370 and 373 m, respectively, to observe the variation of SWC at the various depths. The footprint of the CRNS for SWC observation in the meadow was about 580 m, and the mean measuring depth was about 31 cm according to the general calculation equations. The reference neutron flux for dry soil (N-0) had a mean and coefficient of variation of 8686 and 3\%, respectively, and remained substantially invariant throughout the measuring period. The five SWCs from the independent field samples almost passed through the SWC trend of the CRNS, the root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.011 m(3) m(-3) for the CRNS and oven-drying method. The time series of SWC measured by the CRNS agreed well with the mean SWC series to a depth of 20 cm measured by the weather station. The trend of SWC measured by the Em-50s generally agreed with the trend of SWC measured by the CRNS, but some values and variations of SWC differed between the Em-50s and CRNS data. Because of the good agreement between the CRNS and independent field samples, we suspect that this disagreement is due to an insufficient representativeness of point observations and the distances of the points from the CRNS. The diurnal variation of hourly SWC from the, CRNS was sinusoidal during a dry period, peaking at 11:00 and was minimum at 18:00 (Beijing time), with a range of 1\%. Overall, the CRNS measured SWC in the AME with an acceptable accuracy, providing a scientific basis for the promotion and application of the CRNS in high, cold ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The monsoon climate here is characterized by large interannual and seasonal variability of rainfall causing periods of high and low SWC. Model validation was conducted by comparing simulated SWC with measurements by a gravimetric method in the years 2005 and 2006 at nine agro-meteorological stations. The model-to-measurement R-2 values ranged from 0.40 to 0.82. Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency values were in the range from 0.10 to 0.80. Root mean square error (RMSE) values ranged from 0.028 to 0.056 m(3) m(-3). Simulated evapotranspiration (ET) was consistent with ET estimated from pan evaporation measurements. The BEPS model successfully tracked the dynamics and extent of the serious soil water deficit that occurred during September-November 2006. These results demonstrate the applicability of combining process-based models with remote sensing and GIS techniques in monitoring SWC of croplands and improving agricultural water management at regional scales in a monsoon climate.

	abstract = {A recently developed data assimilation technique offers the potential to greatly expand the geographic domain over which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals can be evaluated by effectively substituting (relatively plentiful) rain-gauge observations for (less commonly available) ground-based soil moisture measurements. The technique is based on calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient (R-value) between rainfall errors and Kalman filter analysis increments realized during the assimilation of a remotely sensed soil moisture product into the antecedent precipitation index (API). Here, the existing R-value approach is modified by reformulating it to run on an anomaly basis where long-term seasonal trends are explicitly removed and by calculating API analysis increments using a Rauch-Tung- Striebel smoother instead of a Kalman filter. This reformulated approach is then applied to a number of Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer soil moisture products acquired within three heavily instrumented watershed sites in the southern U.S. R-value-based evaluations of soil moisture products within these sites are verified based on comparisons with available ground-based soil moisture measurements. Results demonstrate that, without access to ground-based soil moisture measurements, the R-value methodology can accurately mimic anomaly correlation coefficients calculated between remotely sensed soil moisture products and soil moisture observations obtained from dense ground-based networks. Sensitivity results also indicate that the predictive skill of the R-value metric is enhanced by both proposed modifications to its methodology. Finally, R-value calculations are expanded to a quasi-global (50 degrees S-50 degrees N) domain using rainfall measurements derived from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Precipitation Analysis. Spatial patterns in calculated R-value fields are compared to regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling and used to refine expectations concerning the global distribution of land areas in which remotely sensed surface soil moisture retrievals will contribute to atmospheric forecasting applications.},

The experiment was carried out on a Rhodic Ferralsol (typic Haplorthox) in Campinas, SP, Brazil, in an area of 3.42 ha cultivated under the no tillage system, and the sampling was made in a grid of 102 points spaced 10 m x 20 m. Access tubes were inserted down to one meter at each evaluation point in order to measure soil moisture contents (cm(3)cm(-3)) at depths of 30, 60 and 90 cm with a neutron moisture gauge. Samplings were made between the months of August and September of 2003 and in January 2004. The soil moisture content for each sampling date was analyzed using classical statistics in order to appropriately describe the central tendency and dispersion on the data and then using geostatistics to describe the spatial variability. The comparison between the spatial variability for different samplings was made examining scaled semivariograms. Water content was mapped using interpolated values with punctual kriging. The semivariograms showed that, at the 60 ern depth, soil water content had moderate spatial dependence with ranges between 90 and 110 m. However, no spatial dependence was found for 30 and 90 cm depths in 2003. Sampling density was insufficient for an adequate characterization of the spatial variability of soil moisture contents at the 30 and 90 cm depths.},

The yield benefits of SRI compared to conventional systems can be substantial, and yet are regionally variable and have been the subject of considerable debate, due partly to a lack of mechanistic understanding. Here we show that soil properties may in part explain the variability in yield response to SRI. A meta-analysis of data from 72 field studies where SRI was compared with conventional systems indicates that yields increased significantly (P {\textless} 0.0001) when SRI was implemented on highly weathered infertile soils rich in iron and aluminum oxides (Acrisols and Ferralsols), but there was no difference in yield between SRI and conventional systems in more fertile favorable soils for rice production (Gleysols, Luvisols and Fluvisols). The yield difference between SRI and conventional rice production therefore appears to be related in part to soil properties linked to weathering. This should help resolve the debate about the value of SRI and allow research to be targeted toward understanding the biological and chemical processes in soils under SRI management.},

In the current study, a novel algorithm for merging soil moisture from active microwave (SAR) and passive microwave is presented. The MAPSM algorithmMerge Active and Passive microwave Soil Moistureuses a spatio-temporal approach based on the concept of the Water Change Capacity (WCC) which represents the amplitude and direction of change in the soil moisture at the fine spatial resolution. The algorithm is applied and validated during a period of 3 years spanning from 2010 to 2013 over the Berambadi watershed which is located in a semi-arid tropical region in the Karnataka state of south India. Passive microwave products are provided from ESA Level 2 soil moisture products derived from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite (3 days temporal resolution and 40 km nominal spatial resolution). Active microwave are based on soil moisture retrievals from 30 images of RADARSAT-2 data (24 days temporal resolution and 20 m spatial resolution). The results show that MAPSM is able to provide a good estimate of soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 500 m with an RMSE of 0.025 m when comparing it to soil moisture from RADARSAT-2 and in-situ measurements, respectively. The use of Sentinel-1 and RISAT products in MAPSM algorithm is envisioned over other areas where high number of revisits is available. This will need an update of the algorithm to take into account the angle sampling and resolution of Sentinel-1 and RISAT data.},

Failure to satisfy this essential requirement may occur at the scale of the REV or, particularly in numerical simulations, at the scale of the model discretization. The latter can be alleviated by allocation of more computational resources and by working on a finer-grained representation.

We hypothesized that early-time analysis could be used to monitor changes in SWC in clay-rich soil where ground wave and reflection-based GPR methods traditionally fail. An overnight irrigation experiment was performed in a 20-by 14-m section of natural grassland at the Samford Ecological Research Facility in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Both GPR reflection surveys and ground wave velocity analysis were ineffective at the site due to the signal attenuation associated with the clay-rich soil. We collected daily GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data sets during a 5-d period in August 2014, with soil samples collected for gravimetric analysis at the conclusion of data collection. The GPR data display a clear response of the early-time signal amplitude to changes in SWC. The GPR data sets exhibit a strong correlation with SWC, as measured by TDR and gravimetric analysis of soil cores, which is consistent with the dependence of GPR early-time amplitude on relative permittivity. The results suggest that the early-time method can be used to obtain spatially distributed information on subsurface moisture content in clay-rich soils.},

Specifically, two error sources are compared: rainfall forcing due to estimation error by remote sensing techniques and the representation of land-atmospheric processes due to LSM uncertainty [ the Community Land Model, version 3.5 (CLM3.5), was used in this particular study]. CLM3.5 is forced by three remotely sensed precipitation products, namely, two satellite-based estimates-NASA's Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) multisatellite precipitation analysis and NOAA's Climate Prediction Center morphing technique (CMORPH)-and a rain gauge-adjusted radar-rainfall product from the Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) network. The error analysis is performed for the warm seasons of 2004 and 2006 and is facilitated through the use of in situ measurements of soil moisture, rainfall, and other meteorological variables from a network of stations capturing the state of Oklahoma (Oklahoma Mesonet). The study also presents a rigorous benchmarking of the Mesonet network as to its accuracy in deriving area rainfall estimates at the resolution of satellite products (0.25 degrees and 3 h) through comparisons against the most definitive measurements of a smaller-yet-denser network of rain gauges in southwestern Oklahoma (Micronet). The study compares error statistics between modeling and precipitation error sources and between the various remote sensing techniques. Results are contrasted between the relatively moist summer period of 2004 to the drier summer period of 2006, indicating model and error propagation dependencies. An intercomparison between rainfall and modeling error shows that the two error sources are of similar magnitudes in the case of high modeling accuracy (i.e., 2004), whereas the contribution of rainfall forcing error to the uncertainty of soil moisture prediction can be lower when the model's efficiency skill is relatively low (i.e., 2006).},

An experiment was carried out to determine the influence of three drip irrigation regimes on pattern of moisture distribution within the soil profile of Amaranthus cruentus field. Irrigations were carried out at 50 KPa ( Low stress), 60 KPa ( Medium stress) and 70 KPa ( Severe stress) levels. The pattern of soil water extraction differed significantly among treatments ( P{\textless}0.05). A. cruentus extracts water for its use depending on available moisture within depths of the root zone. The surface soil at 0.1 and 0.2 m depths, rapidly losses moisture at the peak of the dry season in treatment 70 KPa ( severely stressed level). Soil hydraulic charge was high (- 80.6 and - 70.9 KPa) at crop emergence in the root zone of A. cruentus during the dry season experiment of 2005 and 2006 respectively. It however reduced to as low as - 5.7 KPa at crop maturity ( 71 - 76 DOY) due to occasional rain showers experienced around the period of crop maturity. Relationship between soil hydraulic charge and soil moisture storage gave r(2) = 0.82 and standard deviation +/- 1.19 at P {\textless} 0.05. The findings from this research may be useful at determining the appropriate moisture stress level at which irrigation is best carried out in vegetable field for optimum yield.},

Simulated retrieved soil moisture products are created using three distinct retrieval algorithms based on the characteristics of passive microwave measurements expected from Hydros. The accuracy of retrieval products is evaluated through comparisons with benchmark soil moisture fields obtained from direct aggregation of the original simulated soil moisture fields. The analysis provides a quantitative description of how land surface heterogeneity, instrument error, and inversion parameter uncertainty impacts propagate through the measurement and retrieval process to degrade the accuracy of Hydros soil moisture products. Results demonstrate that the discrete set of error sources captured by the OSSE induce root mean squared errors of between 2.0\% and 4.5\% volumetric in soil moisture retrievals within the basin. Algorithm robustness is also evaluated for the case of artificially enhanced vegetation water content (W) values within the basin. For large W({\textgreater} 3 kg (.) m(-2)), a distinct positive bias, attributable to the impact of sub-footprint-scale landcover heterogeneity, is identified in soil moisture retrievals.

A total of 228 079 soil P-test values [Dyer method: 1:5 soil-citric acid solution (20 g/L) ratio] generated between 1980 and 2003 by certified commercial laboratories in Brittany (northwestern France) were integrated into a database. Changes in P were analysed by considering four 4-6 year periods between 1980 and 2003 using cumulative frequencies and summary statistics performed on raw soil test values. Then data were aggregated into discrete entities (canton: administrative entities) and summary statistics, linear regression and spatial distribution were carried out. P balances were measured for the same entities taken from the agricultural censuses of 1979, 1988 and 2000. Over the entire study period, a marked spatial variability was observed with higher P content in the western part of Brittany, as well as a systematic increase in median P content with lower amplitude over the past decade. The mean cantonal soil P surplus accumulated over 24 years amounted to 763 kg P/ha of usable agricultural land. Similar P balances sometimes gave rise to widely different increases in P. Cumulative balances were positively correlated with an increase in soil P (r(2) = 0.34).},

	abstract = {Operational land surface models (LSMs) compute hydrologic states such as soil moisture that are needed for a range of important applications (e. g., drought, flood, and weather prediction). The uncertainty in LSM parameters is sufficiently great that several researchers have proposed conducting parameter estimation using globally available remote sensing data to identify best fit local parameter sets. However, even with in situ data at fine modeling scales, there can be significant remaining uncertainty in LSM parameters and outputs. Here, using a new uncertainty estimation subsystem of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) (described herein), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is applied to conduct Bayesian analysis for the accounting of parameter uncertainties. The Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) MCMC algorithm was applied, for which a new parallel implementation was developed. A case study is examined that builds on previous work in which the Noah LSM was calibrated to passive (L-band) microwave remote sensing estimates of soil moisture for the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. In keeping with prior related studies, the parameters subjected to the analysis were restricted to the soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). The main goal is to estimate SHPs and soil moisture simulation uncertainty before and after consideration of the remote sensing data. The prior SHP uncertainty is based on the original source of the standard SHP lookup tables for the Noah LSM. Conclusions are drawn regarding the value and viability of Bayesian analysis over alternative approaches (e. g., parameter estimation, lookup tables) and further research needs are identified.},

	abstract = {ERT techniques are especially promising in (semi-arid) areas with shallow and rocky soils where other methods fail to produce soil moisture maps and to obtain soil profile information. Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) was performed in the Peyne catchment in southern France at four sites located on four different geological substrates. The main objective was to test the usefulness of such geoelectrical method for the assessment of spatial and temporal variability of soil water content and to demarcate subsurface horizontal zones: topsoil, active zone and bedrock. We used time lapse ERT to separate lithological variability from soil moisture content and to evaluate its potential to demarcate subsurface soil horizons. Three measurement campaigns were carried out and field data were collected using the Sting R1/IP advanced resistivity meter with one-channel receiver. We used an array of 28 electrodes with 1 m spacing, which provided reliable resistivity information to a depth of approximately 5.5 m. ERT were followed by soil sampling carried out with a hand auger, directly below the respective geoelectrical profiles. Empirical linear regression was used to determine the specific relationships between volumetric soil moisture of the field samples and electrical resistivity data obtained in situ. Our conclusions are that ERT is a useful technique for providing information on the spatial temporal variability of water content in semi-arid areas and for reaching depths otherwise inaccessible. In this study we proposed a method to delineate three important different soil zones: topsoil, active zone, bedrock, based on resistivity data. These three layers are essential information in understanding and modelling the interaction between subsurface and vegetation water uptake, particularly in semi-arid regions.},

	abstract = {Preferential flow in agricultural soils has been demonstrated to result in agrochemical mobilisation to shallow ground water. Land managers and environmental regulators need simple cost effective techniques for identifying soil - land use combinations in which preferential flow occurs. Existing techniques for identifying preferential flow have a range of limitations including; often being destructive, non in situ, small sampling volumes, or are subject to artificial boundary conditions. This study demonstrated that high frequency soil moisture monitoring using a multi-sensory capacitance probe mounted within a vertically rammed access tube, was able to determine the occurrence, depth, and wetting front velocity of preferential flow events following rainfall. Occurrence of preferential flow was not related to either rainfall intensity or rainfall amount, rather preferential flow occurred when antecedent soil moisture content was below 226 mm soil moisture storage (0-70 cm). Results indicate that high temporal frequency soil moisture monitoring may be used to identify soil type - land use combinations in which the presence of preferential flow increases the risk of shallow groundwater contamination by rapid transport of agrochemicals through the soil profile. However use of high frequency based soil moisture monitoring to determine agrochemical mobilisation risk may be limited by, inability to determine the volume of preferential flow, difficulty observing macropore flow at high antecedent soil moisture content, and creation of artificial voids during installation of access tubes in stony soils.

	abstract = {Microwave remote sensing offers emerging capabilities to monitor global hydrological processes. Instruments like the two dedicated soil moisture missions SMOS and HYDROS or the Advanced Scatterometer on-board METOP will provide a flow of coarse resolution microwave data, suited for macro-scale applications. Only recently, the scatterometer onboard of the European Remote Sensing Satellite, which is the precursor instrument of the Advanced Scatterometer, has been used successfully to derive soil moisture information at global scale with a spatial resolution of 50 km. Concepts of how to integrate macroscale soil moisture data in hydrologic models are however still vague. In fact, the coarse resolution of the data provided by microwave radiometers and scatterometers is often considered to impede hydrological applications. Nevertheless, even if most hydrologic models are run at much finer scales, radiometers and scatterometers allow monitoring of atmosphere-induced changes in regional soil moisture patterns. This may prove to be valuable information for modelling hydrological processes in large river basins ({\textgreater} 10 000 km(2)). In this paper, ERS scatterometer derived soil moisture products are compared to measured runoff of the Zambezi River in south-eastern Africa for several years (1992-2000). This comparison serves as one of the first demonstrations that there is hydrologic relevant information in coarse resolution satellite data. The observed high correlations between basin-averaged soil moisture and runoff time series (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.85) demonstrate that the seasonal change from low runoff during the dry season to high runoff during the wet season is well captured by the ERS scatterometer. It can be expected that the high correlations are to a certain degree predetermined by the pronounced inter-annual cycle observed in the discharge behaviour of the Zambezi. To quantify this effect, time series of anomalies have been compared. This analysis showed that differences in runoff from year to year could, to some extent, be explained by soil moisture anomalies.},

First, we evaluated the forward microwave emission model and soil moisture retrieval algorithm accuracy through the observation of field experiments.

Finally, we conducted a controlled heterogeneity effect experiment measurements using a Truck-mounted Multi-frequency Radiometer (TMMR) to validate our simulation results. This work has proved that the soil moisture retrieval algorithm had a high accuracy (RMSE=0.049 cm(3) cm(-3)) and can satisfy the need of this research. The simulation brightness temperatures match well with observations, with RMSE=9.89 K. At passive microwave remote sensing pixel scale, soil parameters with different spatial distribution patterns could have different levels of error on soil moisture estimation. Overall, we found that soil moisture with a random distribution in a satellite pixel scale can cause the largest error, with a normal distribution being the second, and a uniform distribution the least due to the smallest heterogeneity.},

Soil surface sealing is a frequent phenomenon in dry environments. It modulates soil moisture close to the soil surface and, thus, has the potential to affect the retrieval of soil moisture from microwave remote sensing and the validation of these data based on ground observations. We addressed this issue using a physically-based modeling approach that accounts explicitly for surface sealing at the hillslope scale. Simulated mean soil moisture at the respective layers corresponding to both the ground validation probe and the radar beam's typical effective penetration depth were considered. A cyclic pattern was found in which, as compared to an unsealed profile, the seal layer intensifies the bias in validation during rainfall events and substantially reduces it during subsequent drying periods. The analysis of this cyclic pattern showed that, accounting for soil moisture dynamics at the soil surface, the optimal time for soil sampling following a rainfall event is a few hours in the case of an unsealed system and a few days in the case of a sealed one. Surface sealing was found to increase the temporal stability of soil moisture. In both sealed and unsealed systems, the greatest temporal stability was observed at positions with moderate slope inclination. Soil porosity was the best predictor of soil moisture temporal stability, indicating that prior knowledge regarding the soil texture distribution is crucial for the application of remote sensing validation schemes.},

Satellite precipitation data are used to force VIC for a near-real-time estimate of land surface hydrologic conditions. Initialized with satellite-aided monitoring (MONIT), the climate model (CFSv2)-based forecast (MONIT+CFSv2) and ensemble streamflow prediction (ESP)-based forecast (MONIT+ESP) are both performed. One dry season drought and one wet season drought are employed to test the ability of this framework in terms of real-time tracking and predicting the evolution of soil moisture (SM) drought, respectively. The results show that the skillful CFSv2 climate forecasts (CFs) are only found at the first month. The satellite-aided monitoring is able to provide a reasonable estimate of forecast initial conditions (ICs) in real-time mode. In the presented cases, MONIT+CFSv2 forecast exhibits comparable performance against the observation-based estimates for the first month, whereas the predictive skill largely drops beyond 1 month. Compared to MONIT+ESP, MONIT+CFSv2 ensembles give more skillful SM drought forecast during the dry season, as indicated by a smaller ensemble range, while the added value of MONIT+CFSv2 is marginal during the wet season. A quantitative attribution analysis of SM forecast uncertainty demonstrates that SM forecast skill is mostly controlled by ICs at the first month and that uncertainties in CFs have the largest contribution to SM forecast errors at longer lead times. This study highlights a value of this framework in generating near-real-time ICs and providing a reliable SM drought prediction with 1 month ahead, which may greatly benefit drought diagnosis, assessment, and early warning.},

Results showed significant correlations between soil moisture content (m(v)) and horizontally polarized sigma(o), with coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.64. The root mean square error for the SAR volumetric soil moisture content was 0.09 and 0.06 m(3)/m(3) for the empirical and semiempirical regression models, respectively. Both models had different clustering patterns in the soil moisture maps in the study area. The spatial agreement between maps of soil moisture was in the range of 55 to 65 \% when the maps were reclassified based on intervals of 5 \% mv for both models. In terms of soil moisture interval, both models showed that most of soil moisture changes between the two images (dates) were in the range of +/- 5 \%. Some high differences in.mv were observed between the two models. These were mainly attributed to the non-inverted pixels in the soil moisture maps produced by the semiempirical model. Therefore, this model may be applied for a limited range of soil moisture prediction. The use of regression model could predict a wider range for soil moisture when compared with the semiempirical model. However, more work might be needed to improve the empirical model before scaling it up to the whole study area.},

Innovative and effective approaches for accurate soil moisture simulation are needed. Pedological properties, including soil structure, particle size distribution, porosity, horizon, redox feature, and organic matter content, have been accepted as important factors controlling soil moisture and can be potentially used in soil moisture prediction. However, pedological properties mostly lack quantification (e. g. redox feature, horizon, soil structure), and soil sampling and analysis are time-consuming and costly, especially at large spatial scale. These limitations have restricted the utilisation of pedological information to predict soil moisture spatial-temporal variations at different spatial scales. To overcome these difficulties, new tools including geophysical tools and computed tomography, and new methods including mining soil survey information and integrating pedological information with landscape features and modelling, are proposed in this paper.},

In addition, the proposed method is compared to other existing precision agriculture infrastructures. In this comparison, the proposed infrastructure performs soil moisture mapping in Hubei Province in 1.4 min and near real-time in situ soil moisture interpolation in an efficient manner.

	abstract = {Soil moisture measurements are needed in a large number of applications such as hydro-climate approaches, watershed water balance management and irrigation scheduling. Nowadays, different kinds of methodologies exist for measuring soil moisture. Direct methods based on gravimetric sampling or time domain reflectometry (TDR) techniques measure soil moisture in a small volume of soil at few particular locations. This typically gives a poor description of the spatial distribution of soil moisture in relatively large agriculture fields. Remote sensing of soil moisture provides widespread coverage and can overcome this problem but suffers from other problems stemming from its low spatial resolution. In this context, the DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange (DISPATCH) algorithm has been proposed in the literature to downscale soil moisture satellite data from 40 to 1 km resolution by combining the low-resolution Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite soil moisture data with the high-resolution Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and land surface temperature (LST) datasets obtained from a Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensor. In this work, DISPATCH estimations are compared with soil moisture sensors and gravimetric measurements to validate the DISPATCH algorithm in an agricultural field during two different hydrologic scenarios: wet conditions driven by rainfall events and wet conditions driven by local sprinkler irrigation. Results show that the DISPATCH algorithm provides appropriate soil moisture estimates during general rainfall events but not when sprinkler irrigation generates occasional heterogeneity. In order to explain these differences, we have examined the spatial variability scales of NDVI and LST data, which are the input variables involved in the downscaling process. Sample variograms show that the spatial scales associated with the NDVI and LST properties are too large to represent the variations of the average soil moisture at the site, and this could be a reason why the DISPATCH algorithm does not work properly in this field site.},

Merging multi-resource observations is one of the ways to improve the accuracy of high spatial resolution SM data in the heterogeneous cropland. In this paper, the Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) methodology is implemented to merge the following four types of observed data to obtain the spatial distribution of SM at 100 m scale: soil moisture observed by wireless sensor network (WSN), Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER)-derived soil evaporative efficiency (SEE), irrigation statistics, and Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer (PLMR)-derived SM products (similar to 700 m). From the poor BME predictions obtained by merging only WSN and SEE data, we observed that the SM heterogeneity caused by irrigation and the attenuating sensitivity of the SEE data to SM caused by the canopies result in BME prediction errors. By adding irrigation statistics to the merged datasets, the overall RMSD of the BME predictions during the low-vegetated periods can be successively reduced from 0.052 m(3).m(-3) to 0.033 m(3).m(-3). The coefficient of determination (R-2) and slope between the predicted and in situ measured SM data increased from 0.32 to 0.64 and from 0.38 to 0.82, respectively, but large estimation errors occurred during the moderately vegetated periods (RMSD = 0.041 m(3.)m(-3), R = 0.43 and the slope = 0.41). Further adding the downscaled SM information from PLMR SM products to the merged datasets, the predictions were satisfactorily accurate with an RMSD of 0.034 m(3).m(-3), R-2 of 0.4 and a slope of 0.69 during moderately vegetated periods. Overall, the results demonstrated that merging multi-resource observations into SM estimations can yield improved accuracy in heterogeneous cropland.},

Within the context of the preparation of SMOS activities over land, a field campaign, SMOSREX (Surface Monitoring Of the Soil Reservoir EXperiment), has been in operation since January 2001 in Mauzac, near Toulouse in France. Continuous ground measurements of meteorological variables, soil moisture and temperature profiles have been taken over bare soil and a grass plot left fallow. Since January 2003, SMOSREX has been providing accurate field measurements of dual polarized L-band brightness temperature up-welling from both bare soil and fallow plots, together with multi-spectral (from visible to infrared frequencies) remote sensing surface data. The scientific objectives are presented in this paper and the corresponding experimental design is described. The experimental concept is totally new since (i) SMOSREX combines land-surface-atmosphere observations, passive microwave measurements and VIS to NIR remote sensing, (ii) SMOSREX is based on highly accurate L-band measurements carried out by a radiometer specifically designed for the experiment, and (iii) SMOSREX provides a unique continuous data set of L-band measurements over several years. The characteristics of the L-band emission are presented at diurnal, seasonal and annual temporal scales, and the emissions are compared over bare soil and natural grass. The surface emissions over bare soil and fallow area are shown to be counter-phased at the diurnal scale due to small variations in vegetation water content and bare soil surface moisture. Innovative long term results using L-band measurements for both bare soil and natural grass are presented in this paper, and the relationship between the surface emission at L-band and surface bare soil moisture is shown to be suitable for a long term period (19 months). Soil freezing is shown to be drastically different for bare soil and vegetation covered plots, with a large threshold effect on microwave surface emission. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {Technological advances in satellite remote sensing have offered a variety of techniques for estimating surface soil water content as a key variable in numerous environmental studies. Optical methods are particularly valuable for remote sensing of soil moisture since reflected solar radiation is the strongest passive signal available to satellites and thus observations at optical wavelengths are capable of providing high spatial resolution data. Since remote sensors do not measure soil water content directly, mathematical algorithms that describe the connection between the measured signal and surface water content must be derived. Here, we present a physically-based soil moisture retrieval model in the solar domain (350-2500 nm) that is based on the Kubelka-Munk two-flux radiative transfer theory. The model is designed to describe diffuse reflectance from a uniform, optically thick, absorbing and scattering medium. The theory suggests a linear relationship between a transformed reflectance and soil water content in the short wave infrared bands (e.g. band 7 of Landsat and MODIS satellites) providing an easy-to-use algorithm in these bands. Accuracy of this model was tested and preliminarily verified using laboratory-measured spectral reflectance data of different soils. Further studies on potentials and challenges of this model for large-scale application using optical satellites data remain a topic of ongoing research. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Spatial information on biotopes would be an asset for boreal peatland inventories. It may be helpful for protection and monitoring changes in species diversity caused by artificial regulation of hydrology, atmospheric deposition, and global change. We took a data-driven approach to explore the potential of airborne hyperspectral data in determining plant associations of treeless northern boreal peatlands in Finland (65 degrees 57'N, 24 degrees 29'E). The objective was to produce an ecological peatland classification on a class hierarchical level which would be as detailed as possible, and could be accurately mapped with remotely sensed hyperspectal data. The proper hierarchical class level was decided based on statistical approaches including canonical correspondence analysis, unsupervised classification, and multivariate analysis of variance. Subsequently, fuzzy classification with support vector machines was applied to map the classes in the spatial domain from airborne geo- and atmospherically corrected hyperspectal HyMap data. We conducted detailed in situ sampling for surface plant inventory, soil root zone bulk dielectric permittivity (epsilon), electrical conductivity (sigma), and pH. Constrained canonical correspondence ordination revealed that epsilon, sigma (p{\textless}0.01), and pH (p{\textless}0.001) were significantly correlated with the ordination and were thus important drivers for vegetation composition. Four biotopes were distinguishable by their spectra: Sphagnum fuscum-Emperum nigrum-Rubus chamaemorus-S. angustifolium-bog, Eriophorum vaginatum-S. lindenbergii-sedge fen, eutrophic Carex lasiocarpa-Trichophorum cespitosum-fen, and Comarum palustre-S. majus-Carex rostrata-swamp. The highest overall efficiencies of prediction (overall accuracy 87.8\%, kappa 0.781) were calculated using only 10\% of the original training data indicating that low numbers of properly selected training sites from class boundaries could be appropriate for the support vector machines. The class specific assessment of accuracy with receiver operating characteristics curves also confirmed moderate-to-good successes of the approach with area under the curve values: 0.946 for bog, 0.951 for sedge fen, and 0.999 for eutrophic fen. Clusters of spectrally separable cohesive communities existed but they gradually changed from one plant association to another. Thus fuzzy mapping from hyperspectral and possible complementary data with well performing support vector machines could be justified in spatially continuous inventory and monitoring of boreal peatlands at regional, landscape or national scales.

Acacia saligna was used as the woody perennial component. Treatments, including Acacia saligna (A, AR, W and WR) increased SOM and NT stocks over time compared with the control, probably due to higher SOM and N inputs from the litter and root turnover. The treatments with water harvesting (AR and WR) showed the highest SOM and NT contents by 2008, suggesting that this practice had positive effects on water infiltration rates and soil water content in the soil, important parameters in the process of root turnover. However, there were no significant differences in other soil parameters, such as pH, PT and KT, perhaps due to the short study time, and soil spatial and temporal variability between treatments.},

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture is a key variable for describing water and energy exchanges at the surface/atmosphere interface. The triangle or trapezoid method is appropriate for monitoring the regional surface soil moisture status. In this study, an advanced temperature vegetation dryness index (ATVDI) is used to monitor soil moisture status using an improved surface temperature and a vegetation index space that is formed by the theoretical dry edge determined by the surface energy balance principle and the wet edge extracted from water surface temperature. The ATVDI was validated by in situ soil moisture measurements from the Southern Great Plains (SGP) and is compared with a simple temperature vegetation dryness index (STVDI) estimated from the observed dry edge. The results indicate that the theoretical dry edge forms a trapezoid shape during the period of data coverage whereas the observed dry edge does not. Across all points, the R-2 of the ATVDI (0.35) is greater than that for the STVDI (0.28). For almost all of the sites, the R-2 between the ATVDI and soil moisture apparently improved. We also examined the spatial variation, and the value range of the ATVDI is closer than the STVDI to the real soil moisture conditions. The temporal variation of the ATVDI is closer to soil moisture than that of the STVDI, and the ATVDI is more sensitive to rainfall. This study demonstrates that a theoretical dry edge, determined by the energy balance principle, sets a standard for different days and that the ATVDI could monitor soil moisture conditions better than the STVDI could.

	abstract = {FengYun-3B (FY-3B) soil moisture product, retrieved from passive microwave brightness temperature data based on the Qp model, has rarely been applied at the catchment and region scale. One of the reasons for this is its coarse spatial resolution (25-km). The study in this paper presented a new method to obtain a high spatial resolution soil moisture product by downscaling FY-3B soil moisture product from 25-km to 1-km spatial resolution using the theory of Apparent Thermal Inertia (ATI) under bare surface or sparse vegetation covered land surface. The relationship between soil moisture and ATI was first constructed, and the coefficients were obtained directly from 25-km FY-3B soil moisture product and ATI derived from MODIS data, which is different from previous studies often assuming the same set of coefficients applicable at different spatial resolutions. The method was applied to Naqu area on the Tibetan Plateau to obtain the downscaled 1-km resolution soil moisture product, the latter was validated using ground measurements collected from Soil Moisture/Temperature Monitoring Network on the central Tibetan Plateau (TP-STMNS) in 2012. The downscaled soil moisture showed promising results with a coefficient of determination R-2 higher than 0.45 and a root mean-square error (RMSE) less than 0.11 m(3)/m(3) when comparing with the ground measurements at 5 sites out of the 9 selected sites. It was found that the accuracy of downscaled soil moisture was largely influenced by the accuracy of the FY-3B soil moisture product. The proposed method could be applied for both bare soil surface and sparsely vegetated surface.},

In this study, 9 pairs of moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (MODO9A1 and MOD11A2), covering 5 provinces in Southwest China, were chosen to construct the LST-VI space, and then the spatial distribution of soil moisture in 5 provinces of Southwest China was monitored by the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). Three LST-VI spaces were constructed by normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), and modified soil-adjusted vegetation index (MSAVI), respectively. The correlations between the soil moisture data from 98 sites and the 3 TVDIs calculated by LST-NDVI, LST-EVI and LST-MSAVI, respectively, were analyzed. The results showed that TVDI was a useful parameter for soil surface moisture conditions. The TVDI calculated from the LST-EVI space (TVDIE) revealed a better correlation with soil moisture than those calculated from the LST-NDVI and LST-MSAVI spaces. From the different stages of the TVDIE space, it is concluded that TVDIE can effectively show the temporal and spatial differences of soil moisture, and is an effective approach to monitor soil moisture condition.},

An approach for deriving volumetric soil moisture using satellite passive microwave radiometry from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) was developed in this study. Unlike the major AMSR-E retrieval algorithms that assume fixed scattering albedo values over the globe, the proposed algorithm adopts a weighted averaging strategy for soil moisture estimation based on a dynamic selection of albedo values that are empirically determined. The resulting soil moisture retrievals demonstrate more realistic global patterns and seasonal dynamics relative to the baseline University of Montana soil moisture product. Quantitative analysis of the new approach against in situ soil moisture measurements over four study regions also indicates improvements over the baseline algorithm, with coefficients of determination (R-2) between the retrievals and in situ measurements increasing by approximately 16.9\% and 41.5\% and bias-corrected root-mean-square errors decreasing by about 25.0\% and 38.2\% for ascending and descending orbital data records, respectively. The resulting algorithm is readily applied to similar microwave sensors, including the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, and its retrieval strategy is also applicable to other passive microwave sensors, including lower frequency (L-band) observations from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive mission.},

Results showed that DRP concentrations in leachate increased slowly for the low soil Olsen-P levels but rapidly for the high Olsen-P levels. According to these two-phase changes in the DRP versus soil Olsen-P contents, the thresholds of P leaching risk were estimated to be 41.1 and 62.3mgPkg(-1) (Olsen-P) for silt loam and loam, respectively. The P leaching intensity of soils increased by 3- to 540-fold if the soil Olsen-P contents accumulated from 6.6 to 155.5mgPkg(-1).

	abstract = {With the goal of an effective method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors that can be implemented rapidly, the applicability of a two-point alpha-mixing model was examined for a variety of sensor types. A large number of sensor outputs (X) were taken for four different types of ECH2O soil moisture sensors under varying volumetric water contents (theta) using four test sands with various grain sizes. The two-point alpha-mixing model was fitted to the X-theta data and a fitting parameter, alpha, was determined for each sensor type. Two other widely used sensors, the CS616 and the ThetaProbe ML2x, were also tested using the calibration functions and data provided by the manufacturers, including data for a soil with high electrical conductivity. For the sensors tested in this study, the effects of sensor characteristics were lumped into alpha. The value of alpha was 1.0 to 4.6, generally with high r(2) values. Some of these were as accurate as polynomial models that require a large number of X-theta data. After the alpha value is fitted for a specific sensor type, the two-point alpha-mixing model requires only the measurement of porosity and two extreme X values, i.e., sensor outputs in dry and saturated soils, and does not require soil samples with intermediate water content. Therefore, the two-point alpha-mixing model can be considered as an alternative method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors, especially when porosity is known with small uncertainty such as relatively homogeneous field or laboratory experiments.},

The methodologies have been applied to two sets of data to retrieve SM from bare soils and to verify their accuracy. One data set contains scatterometer and radiometer data acquired on a variety of agricultural fields in different polarizations, frequencies, and incidence angles. The other is made up of five experiments carried out with a C-band scatterometer on rough and smooth soils at different polarizations and incidence angles. There are significant similarities in the performance of each method; they both retrieve the same features and trends in the analyzed data sets. Algorithm performances change according to SM level and data configuration. The main difficulties are found in retrieving low SM values, and in this case, the error on estimates is reduced when the data with two polarizations or two incidence angles are inserted in the inversion procedure. One major difference between the methodologies is that the NN performance improves, with respect to the Bayesian method, when more inputs are presented as two polarizations or two incidence angles in the training phase.},

We explored the ecohydrological characteristics of a two-needle pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.)-Utah juniper [Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little] woodland on the Colorado Plateau in Utah. We have discovered that a high level of natural soil water repellency or hydrophobicity exists under the canopies of both pinyon and juniper species. We found, following summer precipitation events, that soil water repellency tinder trees concentrated the soil water below the surface through finger flow or bypass infiltration, contrasting with piston flow and much more uniform soil wetting in intercanopy locations. We propose that the trees “engineer” their environment, creating water repellency as a way of providing an ecohydrological advantage and reducing potential water uptake by shallow-rooted herbaceous species. In addition, we speculate that soil water repellency may be a major contributing factor to the “nutrient islands” observed to persist under juniper canopies even after the trees have been cut down and removed.},

The feasible parameter space for the inverse modeling was derived using the Rosetta pedotransfer functions from information on sand, silt, and clay contents and bulk density from 273 soil samples taken in the catchment. Our inverse modeling results were able to reproduce the observed time series of soil water content with a root mean square error {\textless} 0.08 cm3 cm- 3 and R2 {\textgreater} 0.75. We found that the MRDs of soil water content were positively correlated with the saturated water content ( qs) and shape- fitting n parameters and negatively correlated with the shape- fitting a and saturated hydraulic conductivity ( Ks) parameters of the VGM model. Moreover, the MRDs of the saturation degree were strongly correlated with the a and n parameters that determine the shape of the VGM model.},

To do this, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent “generalized fertility,” F-G, of a soil using four indicator variables: the relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of F-G in this study were the supply rates of NO3-, P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM fit the data well. The F-G values predicted 51\% of the variance in NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.},

	abstract = {Heat pulse probes (HPP) have been widely utilized to determine soil thermal properties and water content in unfrozen soils; however, their applications in frozen soils are largely restricted by phase change and the presence of unfrozen water. This study explores the possibility of using HPP to determine total water content of frozen soils by (1) establishing the optimum heat applications to limit melting, (2) improving the mathematical representations for frozen conditions, and (3) evaluating the applicability of HPP methods under various temperature and moisture conditions. A custom-built HPP was tested at total moisture levels that varied from full saturation to oven dry and initial soil temperatures from 20 degrees C to -11 degrees C. The applied heat pulse durations varied from 8 to 60 s, with total heat strength varying from 100 to 2000 J m(-1). Comparison of mathematical methods involved two analytical solutions and a one-dimensional finite difference numerical model. While both analytical methods assumed no phase change, the numerical model considered ice melting and unfrozen water. Conclusions include the following: (1) the numerical model with phase change is the only appropriate method to represent the temperature change curve once melting occurs; (2) below -4 degrees C, ice melting could be limited, and measurement errors of total moisture content were within +/-0.05 m(3) m(-3); (3) application of HPP between -2 degrees C and 0 degrees C is difficult because of the retarded response of probe temperature to changing moisture contents and heat applications; and (4) probe spacing is a sensitive parameter requiring calibration once reinstallation of the probe or the thawing and freezing process occurs.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays a critical role in improving the weather and climate forecast and understanding terrestrial ecosystem processes. It is a key hydrologic variable in agricultural drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and irrigation management as well. Satellite retrievals can provide unprecedented soil moisture information at the global scale; however, the products are generally provided at coarse resolutions (25-50km(2)). This often hampers their use in regional or local studies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched in January 2015 aiming to acquire soil moisture and freeze-thaw states over the globe with 2 to 3days revisit frequency. This work presents a new framework based on an ensemble learning method while using atmospheric and geophysical information derived from remote-sensing and ground-based observations to downscale the level 3 daily composite version (L3\_SM\_P) of SMAP radiometer soil moisture over the Continental United States at 1-km spatial resolution. In the proposed method, a suite of remotely sensed and in situ data sets are used, including soil texture and topography data among other information. The downscaled product was validated against in situ soil moisture measurements collected from two high density validation sites and 300 sparse soil moisture networks throughout the Continental United States. On average, the unbiased Root Mean Square Error between the downscaled SMAP soil moisture data and in-situ soil moisture observations adequately met the SMAP soil moisture retrieval accuracy requirement of 0.04m(3)/m(3). In addition, other statistical measures, that is, Pearson correlation coefficient and bias, showed satisfactory results.},

	abstract = {Error characterisation of satellite-retrieved soil moisture (SM) is crucial for maximizing their utility in research and applications in hydro-meteorology and climatology. It can provide insights for retrieval development and validation, and inform suitable strategies for data fusion and assimilation. Su et al. (2013a) proposed a potential Fourier method for quantifying the errors based on the difference between the empirical power spectra of these SM data and a water balance model via spectral fitting (SF), circumventing the need for any ancillary data This work first evaluates its utility by estimating the errors in two passive and active microwave satellite SM over Australia, and comparing the results against the triple collocation (TC) estimator. The SF estimator shows very good agreement with TC in terms of error standard deviation and signal-to-noise ratio, with strong linear correlations of 0.80-0.92 but with lower error estimates. As the two estimators are not strictly comparable, their strong agreement suggests a strong complementarity between time-domain and frequency-domain analyses of errors. A better understanding of the spectral characteristics of the error is still needed to understand their differences. Next, spatial analyses of the derived (SF and TC) error maps, in terms of error standard deviation and noise-to-signal ratio, for the two satellite data are performed with principal component analysis to identify influence of vegetation/leaf-area index (LAI), rainfall, soil wetness, and spatial heterogeneity in topography and soil type on retrieval errors. Lastly, seasonal analysis of the errors discovers systematic temporal variability in errors due to variability in rainfall amount, and less so with changing LAI. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {We present here a simple and robust framework for quantifying the effective sensor depth of cosmic ray soil moisture neutron probes such that reliable water fluxes may be computed from a time series of cosmic ray soil moisture. In particular, we describe how the neutron signal depends on three near-surface hydrogen sources: surface water, soil moisture, and lattice water (water in minerals present in soil solids) and also their vertical variations. Through a combined modeling study of one-dimensional water flow in soil and neutron transport in the atmosphere and subsurface, we compare average water content between the simulated soil moisture profiles and the universal calibration equation which is used to estimate water content from neutron counts. By using a linear sensitivity weighting function, we find that during evaporation and drainage periods the RMSE of the two average water contents is 0.0070 m(3) m(-3) with a maximum deviation of 0.010 m(3) m(-3) for a range of soil types. During infiltration, the RMSE is 0.011 m(3) m(-3) with a maximum deviation of 0.020 m(3) m(-3), where piston like flow conditions exists for the homogeneous isotropic media. Because piston flow is unlikely during natural conditions at the horizontal scale of hundreds of meters that is measured by the cosmic ray probe, this modeled deviation of 0.020 m(3) m(-3) represents the worst case scenario for cosmic ray sensing of soil moisture. Comparison of cosmic ray soil moisture data and a distributed sensor soil moisture network in Southern Arizona indicates an RMSE of 0.011 m(3) m(-3) over a 6 month study period.},

We previously proposed a monitoring technique using ultrasonic waveguides in which soil moisture and groundwater levels are monitored on the basis of the intensity and propagation time of ultrasonic waves reflected from the underground soil surface, respectively. In field monitoring, the reflective intensity depends on the depth of monitoring points and the inhomogeneity of grains, so it has been difficult to examine the reflective intensity change quantitatively. In the present work, we propose improvements that will allow us to measure the intensity change quantitatively. Specifically, we utilize an ultrasonic waveguide of a constant length by using casing pipes with different lengths depending on the monitoring depth and cover the surface of coarse-grained soil with a homogeneous fine soil to obtain repeatable data for wetting and drying cycles. The positive effects of these improvements were confirmed by a field monitoring test. (C) 2015 The Japan Society of Applied Physics},

	abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) is a new remote-sensing technique, and it can be used to estimate near-surface soil moisture from Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) data. Considering the effects of vegetation changes on GNSS-IR in some environments, a non-linear inversion method for soil moisture is proposed. Firstly, the SNR data and satellite elevation angles are solved using Translation, Editing, and Quality Checking. The direct and reflected signals are separated using a low-order polynomial; then, a sinusoidal fitting model of the reflection signal is established; it is used to obtain the amplitude and phase of the SNR interferogram. Finally, an estimation model of vegetation water content and prediction model of the vegetation phase changes are established to modify the original phase and weaken the influence on the vegetation changes. Based on the corrected phase, a Genetic Algorithm Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model is established for soil moisture inversion. According to the GPS monitoring data from the Plate Boundary Observatory H2O network, the experiment indicates that (1) The BPNN is introduced to inverse the soil moisture content, and the non-linear fitting ability of the model is well developed, and the fitting process is stable; (2) the modified phase effectively reduced the effects of vegetation changes on the soil moisture inversion. The correlation coefficient (r) between the inversion results and soil moisture value greatly improved, and the root mean square error and mean absolute error are less than 0.060 and 0.050, respectively. Therefore, the soil moisture problem can be treated as a non-linear event, and the algorithm is feasible and effective.},

	abstract = {Many contract swine producers are located in the southeastern U.S. In this region almost all of the swine effluent from swine production is applied to warm-season perennial species such as bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] which is widely grown for summer grazing and hay production. A 3-yr study was conducted to investigate the impact of forage double-cropping on nutrient accumulation and leaching in Mantachie fine loam soil fertilized with swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) lagoon effluent as the source of plant nutrients. Plots of previously established Tifton 44 bermudagrass were overseeded in the fall with one of four winter annuals: berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.); crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.); ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.); or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four plots of bermudagrass were not overseeded and considered as control. Plots were harvested in spring for cool-season annual hay and in summer for bermudagrass hay. Swine effluent was applied during spring and summer on a need base. Suction lysimeters were installed in selected plots at two depths to monitor nutrient leaching. Surface soil samples were taken to determine baseline nutrient contents, followed by three other sampling dates during the study. Bermudagrass dry matter production (3-yr average = 9.8 Mg ha(-1)) was not adversely affected by the overseeding treatments. Greatest dry matter production was achieved with bermudagrass overseeded with ryegrass (3-yr average = 11.3 Mg ha(-1)). Soil pH decreased by almost one unit by the end of the study. While total P (TP) did not change much, Mehlich-3 P (M3-P), K, Cu, and Zn increased significantly, Mg and Mn concentrations decreased by 2002 compared to the baseline levels. Soil P, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, and Zn accumulation were greater under bermudagrass/wheat combination. In general, the influence of double cropping on soil nutrient accumulation was not conclusive, however, this practice provides the year-round green forage for grazing and haying. Nutrient concentrations in soil and lysimeter leachate were directly related to the quantity of effluent applied. Results also demonstrated that effluent application must be coordinated with the nutrient requirements of the growing forages in order to minimize accumulation and leaching.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneity in soil resources is common in natural communities, in both space and time. In contrast to substantial research into plant responses to spatial nutrient heterogeneity, little is known about the factors that influence plants responses to temporally heterogeneous nutrient supplies. We examine (1) the effects of nutrient pulse length on plant biomass allocation patterns, (2) whether a plant's root system prior to a nutrient pulse influences the benefit a plant can gain from that pulse, and (3) how competition and nutrient pulses interact to influence plant biomass. To address these issues, we used a pot experiment with varying initial conditions (nutrient levels and competition) designed to produce a range of root system sizes in the grass Poa pratensis. We then subjected the plants to short-term (3 and 10 days long) nutrient pulses where the same total nutrients were delivered at varying rates per unit time (intensity). Plant biomass and tissue nitrogen concentration were lowest when pulses were short relative to either long pulses or continuous supply. Plants with larger root systems at the start of the nutrient pulse gained more benefit than smaller plants because final plant size relative to initial root system size decreased as pulse intensity (nutrients delivered per unit time) increased. This study has two important implications. First, since larger plants benefit disproportionately more from a nutrient pulse than smaller plants, pre-pulse conditions such as the competitive environment and resource supply are likely key determinants of a plant's ability to capture nutrients from a pulse. Second, the importance of pre-pulse size provides a belowground mechanism to enhance the size variability among plants in a community.},

A multilayer soil moisture model integrating water fluxes between vegetation, soil, and aquifer is used for simulating soil moisture dynamics and groundwater recharge and loss. The model is calibrated against observed soil moisture content from 1994 to 2000. Model validation is conducted by comparing model simulated groundwater recharge and loss with the corresponding lysimeter-measured values. Statistical results from lysimeter measurements reveal influences of vegetation, depth to groundwater, and soil moisture content on groundwater recharge and loss. Modeling results prove that the model is able to reliably simulate soil moisture content and water fluxes. Water budget analysis shows that the multiyear mean of groundwater recharge is approximately 25\% of the mean of potential evapotranspiration and the multiyear mean groundwater evapotranspiration loss is 22\% of the precipitation amount.},

	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed as part of a water balance instrument cluster across a forested 1 km(2) headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The network, which integrates readings from over 300 sensors, provides spatially representative measurements of snow depth, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. The ability of this densely instrumented watershed to capture catchment- scale snow depth and soil moisture distributions is investigated through comparison with three comprehensive gridded surveys and 1 day of detailed lidar snow data. Statistical analysis shows that the network effectively characterized catchment-wide distributions of snow depth, while offering a cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient means for collecting distributed data in real time. A temporal analysis of snow depth variability reveals that canopy cover is the major explanatory variable of snow depth and that under-canopy measurements persistently show higher variability compared to those in open terrain. An analysis of soil moisture shows lower variability at deeper soil depth and a correlation between mean soil moisture and variability for shallow soils. A three-phase design procedure was used to optimize the WSN deployment. First, as off-the-shelf performance of current WSN platforms for large-scale, long-term deployments cannot be guaranteed, statistics from a prototype deployment were analyzed. Two indicators of network performance, the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator, showed that for our site conditions, a conservative 50 m node-to-node spacing would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. Second, results from the prototype were used to refine hardware specifications and to guide the layout of the full 57-node wireless network. Of these nodes, 23 were used actively for sensing, while the remaining 34 nodes were used as signal repeaters to ensure proper spatial radio coverage and robust network operations. Further analysis of network statistics is conducted during the third, operational, phase to validate system performance.},

The objective of the technology, supported by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office Advanced Information Systems Technology program, is to enable a guided and adaptive sampling strategy for the in-situ sensor network to meet the measurement validation objectives of spaceborne soil moisture sensors. A potential application for this technology is the validation of products from the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP) mission. Spatially, the total variability in soil-moisture fields comes from variability in processes on various scales. Temporally, variability is caused by external forcings, landscape heterogeneity, and antecedent conditions. Installing a dense in-situ network to sample the field continuously in time for all ranges of variability is impractical. However, a sparser but smarter network with an optimized measurement schedule can provide the validation estimates by operating in a guided fashion with guidance from its own sparse measurements. The feedback and control take place in the context of a dynamic physics-based hydrologic and sensor modeling system. The overall design of the smart sensor web-including the control architecture, physics-based hydrologic and sensor models, and actuation and communication hardware-is presented in this paper. We also present results illustrating sensor scheduling and estimation strategies as well as initial numerical and field demonstrations of the sensor web concept. It is shown that the coordinated operation of sensors through the control policy results in substantial savings in resource usage.},

	abstract = {Impedance probes are popular electromagnetic soil moisture monitoring devices used for a variety of applications but require site-specific calibrations to provide accurate measurements. Several calibration techniques have been reported in the literature, although laboratory-based procedures involving wet-up (via upward or downward infiltration) and dry-down are commonly performed for permanently installed sensors. Wet-up calibrations can be completed substantially faster ({\textless}1 d) than dry-down calibrations (1-2 wk), but it is uncertain which technique is preferable to provide the most accurate calibration. The objective of this study was to compare the results obtained from laboratory-based infiltration wet-up and dry-down calibrations of the Stevens Hydra Probe soil moisture sensor. Soil samples for this study were obtained from agricultural sites in Saskatchewan, Canada, at depths of 5, 20, and 50 cm across a variety of textural compositions. Results demonstrate that utilizing either infiltration wet-up (according to the procedure in this study) or dry-down procedures provides accuracies of {\textless} 0.061 m(3) m(-3) root mean square error (RMSE), which was superior to manufacturer calibration accuracy across all samples. However, superior calibration accuracies (i.e., the lowest RMSE) were achieved using the dry-down procedure across all soil samples, resulting in a lower RMSE of 0.01 to 0.04 m(3) m(-3) (at 95\% confidence). A significant c orrelation (r value = 0.61, p {\textless} 0.05) exists between the differences in infiltration wet-up and dry-down calibration RMSEs and clay content. This suggests that the difference between the two procedures tested in this study is more significant in finer textured soils. The findings of this study indicate that the dry-down procedure produced the lowest RMSE and is therefore the preferred calibration procedure, particularly for finer textured soils.},

Measurements were carried out over an irrigated field. The results indicated that the best determination coefficient (r(2)=0.98) between the measured soil water content and all considered variables was estimated by the ANFIS, whereas weaker relationships were calculated between the same variables by MLR as r(2)=0.38 and ANN as r(2)=0.56.

	abstract = {Assessing crops water use is essential for agricultural water management and planning, particularly in water-limited regions. Here, we present a biophysical model to estimate crop actual evapotranspiration and root-zone soil water content using proximal sensing and meteorological data (Crop RS-Met). The model, which is based on the dual FAO56 formulation, uses a water deficit factor calculated from rainfall and atmospheric demand information to constrain actual evapotranspiration and soil water content in crops growing under dry conditions. We tested the Crop RS-Met model in a dryland experimental field comprising a variety of wheat (Tridcum aestivum L. and T. durum) cultivars with diverse phenology. Crop RS-Met was shown to accurately capture seasonal changes in wheat water use during the growing season. The average R-2 of modeled vs. observed soil water content for all cultivars (N = 11) was 0.92 0.02 with average relative RMSE and bias of 9.29 1.30\% and 0.13 0.03\%, respectively. We found that changing the integration time period of the water deficit factor in Crop RS-Met affects the accuracy of the model implying that this factor has a vital role in modeling crop water use under dry conditions. Currently, Crop RS-Met has a simple representation of surface runoff and does not take into consideration heterogeneity in the soil profile. Thus, efforts to combine numerical models that simulate soil water dynamics with a Crop RS-Met model driven by high-resolution remote sensing data may be needed for a spatially continuous assessment of crop water use in fields with more complex edaphic characteristics.},

Although widely implemented in southern Brazil as an annual beef/soybean rotation, tradeoffs such as competing soil water use between pasture and crop phases may result from seasonal grazing in this system. We compared soil water and plant physiological variables in the crop phase of an integrated annual beef-soybean system managed with no-till and best grazing practices with those of an ungrazed cover crop control as part of a long-term experiment in southern Brazil. A mixed black oat (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) pasture was either grazed by beef cattle to 20-cm sward height or left as an ungrazed cover crop in the winter, and direct-planted to soybean (Glycine max [L.] Merr.) in the summer. Although soybean yields did not differ between grazed and ungrazed treatments, soil matric potential was on average 25\% lower across depths and growth stages in plots that had been grazed during winter. Soybeans in grazed plots also exhibited up to 34\% lower light-use efficiency and a 2-week slower time to physiological maturation than soybeans in plots that had not been previously grazed. These results describe for the first time the differential crop growing conditions and crop physiological responses created after 16 years of integration with grazing animals. As integrated crop-livestock systems grow in importance in commercial production settings, this research can inform adaptive management practices to ensure the sustainability of these systems into the future and under a variety of environmental conditions.},

GPR and EMI sensors are valuable instruments as they can provide very informative covariates to be used for improving soil water content estimation. In the present work, it was explored the single (EMI or GPR) and the combined (EMI + GPR) contribution of these proximal data sources. Furthermore, geostatistical (Ordinary Kriging and Kriging with external drift) and linear mixed effects models were applied to compare their respective predictive capabilities. As a result, GPR demonstrated to be more effective in estimating topsoil water content with respect to EMI but, combining both the information, an improvement in the prediction accuracy was observed. Moreover, adding more covariates in the models (GPR outcomes or GPR + EMI outcomes) allowed filtering out the structured spatial component of soil water content. Finally, the statistical approaches proved to behave very similarly, with a slight better performance of Kriging with external drift.},

Intensive cropping without recycling crop residues or other organic inputs results in the loss of soil organic matter (SOM) and nutrients, and is assumed to be non-sustainable. We evaluated the effects of nine different treatments on yields, nitrogen use efficiency, P and K balances, and soil fertility in a wheat-maize rotation system (1991-2010) on silt clay loam in Shaanxi, China. The treatments involved the application of recommended dose of nitrogen (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), nitrogen and potassium (NK), phosphorus and potassium (PK), combined NPK, wheat or maize straw (S) with NPK (SNPK), or dairy manure (M) with NPK (M1NPK and M2NPK), along with an un-treated control treatment (CK). The mean yields of wheat and maize ranged from 992 and 2 235 kg ha(-1) under CK to 5 962 and 6 894 kg ha(-1) under M2NPK treatment, respectively. Treatments in which either N or P was omitted (N, NK and PK) gave significantly lower crop yields than those in which both were applied. The crop yields obtained under NP, NPK and SNPK treatments were statistically identical, as were those obtained under SNPK and MNPK. However, M2NPK gave a significant higher wheat yield than NP, and MNPK gave significant higher maize yield than both NP and NPK. Wheat yields increased significantly (by 86 to 155 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) in treatments where NP was applied, but maize yields did not. In general, the nitrogen use efficiency of wheat was the highest under the NP and NPK treatments; for maize, it was the highest under MNPK treatment. The P balance was highly positive under MNPK treatment, increasing by 136 to 213 kg ha(-1) annually. While the K balance was negative in most treatments, ranging from 31 to 217 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), levels of soil available K remained unchanged or increased over the 20 yr. SOM levels increased significantly in all treatments. Overall, the results indicated that combinations of organic manure and inorganic nitrogen, or returning straw with NP is likely to improve soil fertility, increasing the yields achievable with wheat-maize system in a way which is environmentally and agronomically beneficial on the tested soil.},

	abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture is often necessary in hydrological studies on various scales. One of the challenges is to determine the mean soil moisture of large areas with minimum tabour and costs. The aim of this study is to test temporal persistence of sample locations to decrease the number of samples required to make reliable estimates of mean moisture content in the top soil. Soil moisture data on four experimental sites were collected during the vegetation period in 2004-2006. The experimental sites are located in a steppe environment in northern China, and are characterised by different grazing management which causes differences in vegetation cover. A total of 100 sampling points per site were ranked with respect to their difference to field mean soil moisture using the time-stability concept. We tested whether: (a) representative sample locations exist that predict field mean soil moisture to an acceptable degree, and (b) these locations are time-stable beyond a single vegetation period. Time-stable locations with a low deviation from mean field soil moisture and tow standard deviation were identified for each site. Although the time-stability characteristics of some points varied between years, the selected points were appropriate to predict mean soil moisture of the sites for multiple years. On the field scale, time-stability and the persistence of patterns were analysed by the use of a Spearman rank correlation. The analysis showed that persistence depended on grazing management and the related plant cover. It is concluded that the time-stability concept provides useful information for the validation of hydrological or remote sensing models, or for the upscaling of soil moisture information to larger scales. A preliminary comparison of soil moisture measurements derived from ground-truth and remote sensing data showed that the data matched well in some cases, but that the considerable difference in spatial extent promotes differences in other cases.

However, crop diversity in NTCSW maintained STP and increased SOM 2 g kg(-1) over MTCS. Soil test P, pHs, and SOM were similar between CCRP and HAY, while STK in CCRP was greater at all LP. Lastly, deeper DTC caused greater P buffering and less K buffering than shallower DTC. These results indicate that eroded sideslopes with shallow DTC likely need more or more frequent P and less K than other LP.},

We argue that a nondiagonal R carries more observation information making assimilation results more accurate. A method, denoted TC\_Cov, was proposed for soil moisture data assimilation to estimate spatially correlated observation error covariance based on triple collocation (TC). Assimilation experiments were carried out to test the performance of TC\_Cov. AMSR-E soil moisture was assimilated with a diagonal R matrix computed using the TC and assimilated using a nondiagonal R matrix, as estimated by proposed TC\_Cov. The ensemble Kalman filter was considered as the assimilation method. Our assimilation results were validated against climate change initiative data and ground-based soil moisture measurements using the Pearson correlation coefficient and unbiased root mean square difference metrics. These experiments confirmed that deterioration of diagonal R assimilation results occurred when model simulation is more accurate than observation data. Furthermore, nondiagonal R achieved higher correlation coefficient and lower ubRMSD values over diagonal R in experiments and demonstrated the effectiveness of TC\_Cov to estimate richly structuralized R in data assimilation. In sum, compared with diagonal R, nondiagonal R may relieve the detrimental effects of assimilation when simulated model results outperform observation data.

	abstract = {The detection of critical source areas (CSAs) is a key step in managing soil phosphorus (P) loss and preventing the long-term eutrophication of water bodies at regional scale. Most related studies, however, focus on a local scale, which prevents a clear understanding of the spatial distribution of CSAs for soil P loss at regional scale. Moreover, the continual, long-term variation in CSAs was scarcely reported. It is impossible to identify the factors driving the variation in CSAs, or to collect land surface information essential for CSAs detection, by merely using the conventional methodologies at regional scale. This study proposes a new regional-scale approach, based on three satellite sensors (ASTER, TM/ETM and MODIS), that were implemented successfully to detect CSAs at regional scale over 15 years (2000-2014). The approach incorporated five factors (precipitation, slope, soil erosion, land use, soil total phosphorus) that drive soil P loss from CSAs. Results show that the average area of critical phosphorus source areas (CPSAs) was 15,056 km(2) over the 15-year period, and it occupied 13.8\% of the total area, with a range varying from 12\% to 23.0\%, in a representative, intensive agricultural area of China. In contrast to previous studies, we found that the locations of CSAs with P loss are spatially variable, and are more dispersed in their distribtition over the long term. We also found that precipitation acts as a key driving factor in the variation of CSAs at regional scale. The regional-scale method can provide scientific guidance for managing soil phosphorus loss and preventing the long-term eutrophication of water bodies at regional scale, and shows great potential for exploring factors that drive the variation in CSAs at global scale.

The algorithm uses in situ and remote sensing information and statistical tools to estimate soil moisture at 1 km spatial resolution and at 20 cm depth over Puerto Rico.

The temporal variability for a given area exhibits long- and short-term variations that can be expressed by two empirical models. The average monthly soil moisture exhibits the long- term variability and is modelled by an artificial neural network ( ANN), whereas the short-term variability is determined by hourly variation and is represented by a nonlinear stochastic transfer function model. Monthly vegetation index, land surface temperature, accumulated rainfall and soil texture are the major drivers of the ANN to estimate the monthly soil moisture. Radar, satellite and in situ observations are the major sources of information of the soil moisture empirical models. A self-organized ANN was also used to identify spatial variability to be able to determine a similar transfer function that best resembles the properties of a particular grid point and estimate the hourly soil moisture across the island. Validation techniques reveal an average absolute error of 3.34\% of volumetric water content and this result shows that the proposed algorithm is a potential tool for estimating soil moisture over vegetated areas.},

In this paper, a hybrid analytical/numerical solution to two-dimensional scattering from multilayer rough surfaces separated by arbitrary dielectric profiles based on the extended boundary condition method (EBCM) and scattering matrix technique is presented. The reflection and transmission matrices of rough interfaces are constructed using EBCM. The dielectric profiles are modeled as stacks of piecewise homogeneous dielectric thin layers, whose scattering matrices are computed by recursively cascading reflection and transmission matrices of individual dielectric interfaces. The interactions between the rough interfaces and stratified dielectric profiles are taken into account by applying the generalized scattering matrix technique. The scattering coefficients are obtained by combining the powers computed from the resulting Floquet modes of the overall system. The bistatic scattering coefficients are validated against existing analytical and numerical solutions. Field-collected soil moisture data are then used for numerical simulations to investigate the penetration capability at different frequencies and to address the potential of low-frequency radar systems in estimating deep soil moisture. In particular, soil moisture profiles during dry ground, wet ground, and wet subsurface layer conditions are examined. The results show that both backscattering coefficients and copolarized phase difference at low frequencies are sensitive to the roughness of subsurface interfaces and deep soil moisture. Also, much larger depth sensitivity can be achieved using copolarized phase difference than scattering coefficients.},

The implementation of the OSSE is based on the following: a 1-km land surface model over the Red-Arkansas River Basin, a forward microwave emission model to simulate the radiometer observations, a realistic orbital and sensor model to resample the measurements mimicking Aquarius operation, and an inverse soil moisture retrieval model. The simulation implements a zero-order radiative transfer model. Retrieval is performed by direct inversion of the forward model. The Aquarius OSSE attempts to capture the influence of various error sources, such as land surface heterogeneity, instrument noise, and retrieval ancillary parameter uncertainty, all on the accuracy of Aquarius surface soil moisture retrievals. In order to assess the impact of these error sources on the estimated volumetric soil moisture, a quantitative error analysis is performed by comparison of footprint-scale synthetic soil moisture with “true” soil moisture fields obtained from the direct aggregation of the original 1-km soil moisture field input to the forward model. Results show that, in heavily vegetated areas, soil moisture retrievals have a positive bias that can be suppressed with an alternative aggregation strategy for ancillary parameter vegetation water content (VWC). Retrieval accuracy was also evaluated when adding errors to 1-km VWC (which are intended to account for errors in VWC derived from remote sensing data). For soil moisture retrieval root-mean-square error on the order of 0.05 m(3)/m(3), the error in VWC should be less than 12\%.},

However, neglecting ecological knowledge about species, e.g. their seasonal movements, and ignoring the proper environmental factors that can explain key elements for species survival (shelter, food and water) increase model uncertainty. This study exemplifies how these ecological gaps in species distribution modeling can be addressed by modeling the distribution of the emu (Dromaius novaehollandiae) in Australia. Emus cover a large area during the austral winter. However, their habitat shrinks during the summer months. We show evidence of emu summer habitat shrinkage due to higher fire frequency, and low water and food availability in northern regions. Our findings indicate that emus prefer areas with higher vegetation productivity and low fire recurrence, while their distribution is linked to an optimal intermediate (similar to 0.12 m(3) m(-3)) soil moisture range. We propose that the application of three geospatial data products derived from satellite remote sensing, namely fire frequency, ecosystem productivity, and soil water content, provides an effective representation of emu general habitat requirements, and substantially improves species distribution modeling and representation of the species' ecological habitat niche across Australia.},

	abstract = {Soil water content has a significant effect on penetrometer resistance, so simultaneous on-the-go measurement of both these parameters can provide useful information on within-field spatial variations in soil compaction. In this study we improved and refined the electronic circuitry and mechanical construction of an existing sensor and evaluated it as a combined horizontal penetrometer in the field. This paper concentrates on its ability to determine soil water content (volumetric basis) in the field. Stationary calibration was first performed in the laboratory on remoulded loam soil (gleyic Cambisol) at gravimetric water content 0-0.28 g g(-1) and wet bulk density 1.4-1.8 g cm(-3). A quadratic relationship was found between sensor output and volumetric water content. Simulations of the sensor fringe field using a finite element model showed that at a dielectric constant of 5 (dry soil) the zone of influence of the sensor (i.e. the distance from the centre of the sensor) was approximately 70 mm, whilst at a dielectric constant of 30 (an estimate of wet soil) it was 40 mm. The dielectric sensor was then implemented together with a load cell on a tine for field measurement of water content and penetrometer resistance, and a series of transect measurements were conducted to assess its accuracy over a range of natural soil water contents in the field. Within the volumetric water content range 0.30-0.40 cm(3) cm(-3), a linear relationship fitted the sensor output versus water content data, which was in close agreement with the laboratory calibration. Additional studies on the effect of travelling speed on dielectric sensor performance showed no clear trends, but further investigations are needed. A significant negative correlation was observed between penetrometer resistance and water content. The developed combined horizontal penetrometer can be a promising useful instrument for future studies in soil compaction and precision agriculture. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The assessment and quantification of spatio-temporal soil characteristics and moisture patterns are important parameters in the monitoring and modeling of soil landscapes. Remote-sensing techniques can be applied to characterize and quantify soil moisture patterns, but only when dealing with bare soil. For soils with vegetation, it is only possible to quantify soil-moisture characteristics through indirect vegetation indicators, i.e. the “vitality” of plants. The “vitality” of vegetation is a sum of many indicators, whereby different stress factors can induce similar changes to the biochemical and physiological characteristics of plants. Analysis of the cause and effect of soil-moisture properties, patterns and stress factors can therefore only be carried out using an experimental approach that specifically separates the causes. The study describes an experimental approach and the results from using an imaging hyperspectral sensor AISA-EAGLE (400-970 nm) and a non-imaging spectral sensor ASD (400-2,500 nm) under controlled and comparable conditions in a laboratory to study the spectral response compared to biochemical and biophysical vegetation parameters (”vitality”) as a function of soil moisture characteristics over the entire blooming period of Ash trees. At the same time that measurements were taken from the hyperspectral sensors, the following vegetation variables were also recorded: leaf area index (LAI), chlorophyll meter value - SPAD-205, vegetation height, C/N content and leaf water content as indicators of the “vitality” and the state of the vegetation. The spectrum of each hyperspectral image was used to calculate a range of vegetation indices (VI's) with relationships for soil moisture characteristics and stress factors. The relationship between vegetation indices and plant “vitality” indicators was analysed using a Generalized Additive Model (GAM). The results show that leaf water content is the most appropriate vegetation indicator for assessing the “vitality” of vegetation. With the Water Index (WI) it was possible to differentiate between the moisture treatments of the control, moisture drought stress and the moisture flooding treatment over the entire growing season of the plants (R (2) = 0.94). There is a correlation between the “vitality” vegetation parameters (LAI, C/N content and vegetation height) and the indicators NDVI, WI, PRI and Vog2. In our study with Ash trees the vegetation parameter chlorophyll was found not to be a suitable indicator for detecting the “vitality” of plants using the spectral indicators. There is a possibility that the sensitivity of the indicators selected was too low compared to changes in the chlorophyll content of Ash trees. Adding the co-variable `time' strengthens the correlation, whereas incorporating time and moisture treatment only improves the model very slightly. This shows that changes to the biochemical and biophysical characteristics caused by phenology, overlay a differentiation of the moisture treatments.},

	abstract = {Ensemble Kalman filter is a new sequential data assimilation algorithm which was originally developed for atmospheric and oceanographic data assimilation. It can be applied to calculate error covariance matrix through Monte-Carlo simulation. This approach is able to resolve the nonlinearity and discontinuity existed within model operator and observation operator. When observation data are assimilated at each time step, error covariances are estimated from the phase-space distribution of an ensemble of model states. The error statistics is then used to calculate Kalman gain matrix and analysis increments. In this study, we develop a one-dimensional soil moisture data assimilation system based on ensemble Kalman filter, the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB2) and microwave radiation transfer model (AIEM, advanced integration equation model). We conduct numerical experiments to assimilate in situ soil surface moisture measurements and low-frequency passive microwave remote sensing data into a land surface model, respectively. The results indicate that data assimilation can significantly improve the soil surface moisture estimation. The improvement in root zone is related to the model bias errors at surface layer and root zone. The soil moisture does not vary significantly in deep layer. Additionally, the ensemble Kalman filter is predominant in dealing with the nonlinearity of model operator and observation operator. It is practical and effective for assimilating observations in situ and remotely sensed data into land surface models. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	doi = {10.1002/wrcr.20495},
	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at the local scale is required to account for small-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface because many hydrological processes manifest at scales ranging from cm to km. Although remote sensing (RS) platforms provide large-scale soil moisture dynamics, scale discrepancy between observation scale (e.g., approximately several kilometers) and modeling scale (e.g., few hundred meters) leads to uncertainties in the performance of land surface hydrologic models. To overcome this drawback, we developed a new deterministic downscaling algorithm (DDA) for estimating fine-scale soil moisture with pixel-based RS soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) products using a genetic algorithm. This approach was evaluated under various synthetic and field experiments (Little Washita-LW 13 and 21, Oklahoma) conditions including homogeneous and heterogeneous land surface conditions composed of different soil textures and vegetations. Our algorithm is based on determining effective soil hydraulic properties for different subpixels within a RS pixel and estimating the long-term soil moisture dynamics of individual subpixels using the hydrological model with the extracted soil hydraulic parameters. The soil moisture dynamics of subpixels from synthetic experiments matched well with the observations under heterogeneous land surface condition, although uncertainties (Mean Bias Error, MBE: -0.073 to -0.049) exist. Field experiments have typically more variations due to weather conditions, measurement errors, unknown bottom boundary conditions, and scale discrepancy between remote sensing pixel and model grid resolution. However, the soil moisture estimates of individual subpixels (from the airborne Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) footprints of 800 m x 800 m) downscaled by this approach matched well (R: 0.724 to -0.914, MBE: -0.203 to -0.169 for the LW 13; R: 0.343-0.865, MBE: -0.165 to -0.122 for the LW 21) with the in situ local scale soil moisture measurements during Southern Great Plains Experiment 1997 (SGP97). The good correspondence of observed soil water characteristics (h) functions (from the soil core samples) and genetic algorithm (GA) searched soil parameters at the LW 13 and 21 sites demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. Although the algorithm is tested under limited conditions at field scale, this approach improves the availability of remotely sensed soil moisture product at finer resolution for various land surface and hydrological model applications.},

The performance of the system is evaluated against the current operational Optimal Interpolation (OI) system. Both systems use proxy observations, i.e., 2 m air temperature and relative humidity. The spatial structure of the analysis increments obtained from both analyses are comparable. However, the EKF-based increments are generally higher for the top soil layers then for the bottom layer. This gradient better reflects the underlying hydrological processes in that the strongest interaction between soil moisture and bare soil evaporation and transpiration through vegetation should occur in top layers where most of the roots are located. The impact on the forecast skill, e. g., air temperature at 2 m and 500 hPa height, is neutral. The new EKF surface analysis system offers a range of further development options for the exploitation of satellite observations for the initialization of the land surface in Numerical Weather Prediction.

Variation in SWUE among biomes, climate conditions, and latitudes from 2000 to 2014 was comprehensively assessed. Average global SWUE over this 15-year period was approximately 3.47 gC/kgH(2)O. SWUE was relatively high for ecosystems near the equator and decreased gradually with increasing latitude. At the biome level, high SWUE was measured in evergreen broadleaf forests, and lower values were found in shrublands. Compared with two other commonly used indicators of water use efficiency, EWUE (ratio of gross primary production to evapotranspiration) and RUE (ratio of gross primary production to precipitation), average SWUE from 2000 to 2014 was significantly higher and had the largest range of values. In addition, spatial distributions of these three indicators varied greatly. The new indicator SWUE will help promote understanding of soil water use in various ecosystems. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The major findings were: (1) The ensemble data set was able to provide more realistic soil moisture information than individual remote sensing products; (2) during the study period, the soil moisture increased in semiarid regions and decreased in arid regions with anoverall drying trend for the whole country; (3) the soil moisture variation trends derived from the three retrieval products and the ensemble data differ from each other but all data sets show the dominant drying trend for the summer, and that most of the drying regions were in major agricultural areas; (4) compared with the precipitation trends derived from Global Precipitation Climatology Project data, it is speculated that climate change is a possible cause for the drying trend in semiarid regions and the wetting trend in arid regions; and (5) combining soil moisture trends with land surface temperature trends derived from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiomete, the study domain was divided into four categories. Regions with drying and warming trends cover 33.2\%, the regions with drying and cooling trends cover 27.4\%, the regions with wetting and warming trends cover 21.1\% and the regions with wetting and cooling trends cover 18.1\%.

	abstract = {The brightness temperature (BT) and backscattering coefficient (BSC) measured simultaneously by passive and active microwave sensors have great potential for the estimation of land surface soil moisture (SM). Several methods with combined passive and active microwave remote sensing observations for SM have been reported. Usually, the use of these methods, requires an accurate roughness condition, especially when dealing over the bare surface or surface with low vegetation. In this paper, two different retrieval methods for estimating SM using synthetic microwave remote sensing data were compared. The difference between the two methods is the way to estimate the roughness parameter. The three-parameter retrieval approach (THRA) takes the roughness parameter as a variable to be retrieved, and derives land surface parameters (e.g., SM, surface temperature (ST) and roughness) simultaneously from BT and BSC using nonlinear algorithms. The two-parameter retrieval approach (TWRA) retrieves roughness from BSC firstly, then takes the roughness as an input parameter to retrieve SM and ST from BT. The two retrieval methods were applied on AMSR-E (Advance Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS) and QuikSCAT/Seawinds (The Seawinds scatterometer on NASA's (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) Quick Scatterometer) observations which have been carried out for the SMEX03 (Soil Moisture Experiment 2003) region in ON, the north of Oklanoma. The comparison results shows TWRA has achieved a higher accuracy than THRA in dealing with the active and passive microwave observations at different overpass times. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Significant advances have been achieved in generating soil moisture (SM) products from satellite remote sensing and/or land surface modeling with reasonably good accuracy in recent years. However, the discrepancies among the different SM data products can be considerably large, which hampers their usage in various applications. The bias of one SM product from another is well recognized in the literature. Bias estimation and spatial correction methods have been documented for assimilating satellite SM product into land surface and hydrologic models. Nevertheless, understanding the characteristics of each of these SM data products is required for many applications where the most accurate data products are desirable. This study inter-compares five SM data products from three different sources with each other, and evaluates them against in situ SM measurements over 14-year period from 2000 to 2013. Specifically, three microwave (MW) satellite based data sets provided by ESA's Climate Change Initiative (CCI) (CCI-merged, -active and -passive products), one thermal infrared (TIR) satellite based product (ALEXI), and the Noah land surface model (LSM) simulations. The in-situ SM measurements are collected from the North American Soil Moisture Database (NASMD), which involves more than 600 ground sites from a variety of networks. They are used to evaluate the accuracies of these five SM data products. In general, each of the five SM products is capable of capturing the dry/wet patterns over the study period. However, the absolute SM values among the five products vary significantly. SM simulations from Noah LSM are more stable relative to the satellite-based products. All TIR and MW satellite based products are relatively noisier than the Noah LSM simulations. Even though MW satellite based SM retrievals have been predominantly used in the past years, SM retrievals of the ALEXI model based on TIR satellite observations demonstrate skills equivalent to all the MW satellite retrievals and even slightly better over certain regions. Compared to the individual active and passive MW products, the merged CCI product exhibits higher anomaly correlation with both Noah LSM simulations and in-situ SM measurements.

Considering the difficulties in modeling the complex soil-vegetation scattering mechanisms and the great need of ancillary data for microwave backscatter SM inversion, algorithms based on temporal change are currently the best method to examine SM variability. This paper evaluates the spatial sensitivity of the ASAR GM surface SM product derived using the temporal change detection methodology developed by the Vienna University of Technology. This evaluation is made for an area in southeastern Australia using data from the National Airborne Field Experiment 2005. The spatial evaluation is made using three different types of SM data (station, field, and airborne) across several different scales (1-25 km). Results confirmed the expected better agreement when using point (R-station = 0.75) data as compared to spatial (R-PLMR,R- 1 km = 0.4) data. While the aircraft-ASAR GM correlation values at 1-km resolution were low, they significantly improved when averaged to 5 km (R-PLMR,R- 5 km = 0.67) or coarser. Consequently, this assessment shows the ASAR GM potential for monitoring SM when averaged to a spatial resolution of at least 5 km.},

Despite the significant improvements in drought modeling over the last decade, accurate provisions of drought conditions in a timely manner is still a major research challenge. In order to improve the current drought monitoring skills, this study presents a land data assimilation system by merging the remotely sensed surface soil moisture with the model simulations with the use of a recently developed particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (PMCMC) method. To cope with the computational complexity, a modular parallel particle filtering framework (PPFF) is developed which allows a large ensemble size in PMCMC applications. The implementation of the proposed system is demonstrated with the 2012 summer flash drought case study over the Contiguous United States (CONUS). Results from both synthetic and real case studies suggest that the land data assimilation system improves the soil moisture predictions and the drought monitoring skills. Compared with the U.S. Drought Monitoring (USDM), the land data assimilation can better capture the drought onset on May 2012 and the drought severity in June and July 2012. This study recommends that the proposed land data assimilation system based on a high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructure can better facilitate the drought preparation and response actions.},

Subsequently, the satellite has been in operation for over six years while the retrieval algorithms from Level 1 (L1) to Level 2 (L2) underwent significant evolutions as knowledge improved. Moreover, other approaches for retrieval at L2 over land were investigated while Level 3 (L3) and Level 4 (L4) were initiated. In this paper, these improvements were assessed by inter comparisons of the current L2 (V620) against the previous version (V551) and new products (using neural networks referred to as SMOS-NN) and 1.3 (referred to as SMOS-L3). In addition, a global evaluation of different SMOS soil moisture (SM) products (SMOS-L2, SMOS-L3, and SMOS-NN) was performed comparing products with those of model simulations and other satellites. Finally, all products were evaluated against in situ measurements of soil moisture (SM). To achieve such a goal a set of metrics to evaluate different satellite products are suggested. The study demonstrated that the V620 shows a significant improvement (including those at L1 improving L2) with respect to the earlier version V551. Results also show that neural network based approaches can often yield excellent results over areas where other products are poor. Finally, global compa'rison indicates that SMOS behaves very well when compared to other sensors/approaches and gives consistent results over all surfaces from very dry (African Sahel, Arizona), to wet (tropical rain forests). RFI (Radio Frequency Interference) is still an issue even though detection has been greatly improved through the significant reduction of RFI sources in several areas of the world. When compared to other satellite products, the analysis shows that SMOS achieves its expected goals and is globally consistent over different eco climate regions from low to high latitudes and throughout the seasons.

	abstract = {Drought is a major cause of limited agricultural productivity and of crop yield uncertainty throughout the world. For that reason, agricultural drought research and monitoring are of increasing interest. Although soil moisture is the main variable to define and identify agricultural drought, the actual soil water content is rarely taken into account because this type of drought is commonly studied using methodologies based on either climatological data or hydrological modeling. Currently, it is possible to use remote sensing to obtain global and frequent soil moisture data that could be directly used for agricultural drought monitoring everywhere. For example, the SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) satellite was launched in 2009 and provides global soil moisture maps every 1-2 days. In this work, the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) was calculated using the SMOS 12 soil moisture series in the REMEDHUS (Soil Moisture Measurement Stations Network) area (Spain) during the period 2010-2014. The satellite index was thus calculated using several approaches to obtain the soil water parameters and was compared with the SWDI obtained from in situ data. One approach was based directly on SMOS soil moisture time series (using the 5th percentile as an estimator for wilting point and the 95th percentile and the minimum of the maximum value during the growing season as estimators for field capacity). In this case, the results of the comparison were good, but the temporal distribution and the range of the index data were unrealistic. Other approaches were based on in situ data parameters and pedotransfer functions estimation. In this case, the results were better, and the satellite index was able to adequately identify the drought dynamics. Therefore, the final choice to apply the index in one particular site will depend on the availability of data. Finally, a comparison analysis was made with the SMOS SWDI and two indices (Crop Moisture Index, CMI, and Atmospheric Water Deficit, AWD) commonly used for agricultural drought monitoring and assessment. In both cases, the agreement was very good, and it was proven that SMOS SWDI reproduces well the soil water balance dynamics and is able to appropriately track agricultural drought.

Soil moisture (SM) of permafrost is one of the most important factors influencing the energy flux, ecosystem, and hydrologic process. The objectives of this paper are to retrieve the permafrost SM using time-series SAR images, without the need of auxiliary survey data, and reveal its variation patterns. After analyzing the characteristics of time-series radar backscattering coefficients of different landcover types, a two-component SM retrieval model is proposed. For the alpine meadow area, a linear retrieving model is proposed using the TerraSAR-X time-series images based on the assumption that the lowest backscattering coefficient is measured when the soil moisture is at its wilting point and the highest backscattering coefficient represents the water-saturated soil state. For the alpine desert area, the surface roughness contribution is eliminated using the dual SAR images acquired in the winter season with different incidence angles when retrieving soil moisture from the radar signal. Before the model implementation, landcover types are classified based on their backscattering features. 22 TerraSAR-X images are used to derive the soil moisture in Beiluhe, Northern Tibet with different incidence angles. The results obtained from the proposed method have been validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements, thus obtaining RMSE and Bias of 0.062 cm(3)/cm(3) and 4.7\%, respectively. The retrieved time-series SM maps of the study area point out the spatial and temporal SM variation patterns of various landcover types.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an essential component of the environmental and the agricultural system. Continuous monitoring and forecasting of soil moisture is a desirable strategy to understand the soil dynamics for proactive planning and decision-making measures for agriculture and related fields. In this study hybrid data-intelligent, extreme learning machine (ELM) models are designed and explored for monthly SM forecasting. The chaotic, complex and dynamical behavior of SM can compound the accuracy of data-driven models. Consequently, two versatile, computationally efficient and self-adaptive multi-resolution utilities namely, complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) and the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) algorithms are utilized to address these data non-stationarity issues, which if not resolved can lead to model prediction inaccuracies. The difference in these approaches is that, during the EEMD process, a Gaussian white noise is added to the intact (i.e., unresolved) time series only, while, the CEEMDAN requires sequential additions at each decomposition phase. Integration of these multi-resolution tools with the ELM model led to the hybrid CEEMDAN-ELM and the EEMD-ELM models, that were benchmarked with random forest (RF) equivalent models. Using WaterDyn model's hind-simulated SM data, these models were applied (without any climate inputs) to forecast the upper (0.2 m) and the lower layer (0.2-1.5 m depth) soil moisture in Australia's agricultural hub, the Murray-Darling Basin. The standalone ELM and RF model has similar computation efficiency and model performances. However, despite the implementation of computationally expensive ensemble techniques (i.e., EEMD and CEEMDAN, the hybrid ensembles EEMD-ELM and CEEMDAN-ELM were highly efficient with improved performances. The research outcomes showed that the CEEMDAN-ELM model outperformed the alternative models at three (out of the seven) sites applied for upper layer SM forecasts, while the EEMD-ELM hybrid model was superior at all seven sites for the lower layer soil moisture forecasts. The study signifies the important role of the self-adaptive multi-resolution utility (CEEMDAN) hybridized with the ELM algorithm to potentially develop automated prediction systems for forecasting soil moisture, with potential applications in agriculture.},

The results indicated that crops receiving GSM and compost performed well during the deficit rainfall year (2004) as well as during the normal rainfall year (2005) and recorded 12-16\% higher yields of groundnut and 9-14\% higher yields in castor over the FP. During 2004 which was a deficit rainfall year, GSM and compost application enhanced soil moisture by 14-40\%, percentage of filled pods by 59-65\% and 100 seed weight by 18\% in groundnut while in castor 6-33\% improved soil moisture enhanced capsules per plant from 45 to 57\% without any significant effect on 100 seed weight. These treatments were followed by groundnut shell applied crop, RDF and regenerative (organics only) treatments. However, during 2005 the order in which higher yields achieved by treatments were GSM application, compost followed by RDF due to well-distributed rainfall. Therefore to sustain yields in rainfed groundnut and castor crops, present experimentation emphasized application of organics to improve soil fertility and drought management ability by recycling crop residues through a simple process of cattle shed bedding. This was an attempt to introduce the practice of cattle shed bedding as value addition to process other locally available crop residues to the practitioners of farming (especially parts of Africa and Latin America).},

The level of soil nitrogen content influences the nutrient levels of crops directly. The near infrared sensor can be used to detect the soil nitrogen content rapidly, nondestructively, and conveniently. In order to investigate the effect of the different soil water content on soil nitrogen detection by near infrared sensor, the soil samples were dealt with different drying times and the corresponding water content was measured. The drying time was set from 1 h to 8 h, and every 1 h 90 samples (each nitrogen concentration of 10 samples) were detected. The spectral information of samples was obtained by near infrared sensor, meanwhile, the soil water content was calculated every 1 h. The prediction model of soil nitrogen content was established by two linear modeling methods, including partial least squares (PLS) and uninformative variable elimination (UVE). The experiment shows that the soil has the highest detection accuracy when the drying time is 3 h and the corresponding soil water content is 1.03\%. The correlation coefficients of the calibration set are 0.9721 and 0.9656, and the correlation coefficients of the prediction set are 0.9712 and 0.9682, respectively. The prediction accuracy of both models is high, while the prediction effect of PLS model is better and more stable. The results indicate that the soil water content at 1.03\% has the minimum influence on the detection of soil nitrogen content using a near infrared sensor while the detection accuracy is the highest and the time cost is the lowest, which is of great significance to develop a portable apparatus detecting nitrogen in the field accurately and rapidly.},

AMSR2 Level 3 (L3) soil moisture products retrieved from two versions of brightness temperatures using the Japanese Aerospace eXploration Agency (JAXA) and the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) algorithm were included. For the LPRM algorithm, two different parameterization methods were applied. Furthermore, two versions of SMOS L3 soil moisture product were assessed. The results are contrasted against the use of “random” stations. Accounting for all versions, frequencies and overpasses, the latest versions of the JAXA UX2) and LPRM (LP3) products were found to surpass the earlier versions (JX1, LP1 and LP2). Soil moisture retrieval based on the latter version of brightness temperature and parameterization scheme improved when C-band observations were used but not X-band. However, X-band retrievals (r: 0.71, MAE: 0.07, RMSD: 0.08 m3/m3) were found to perform better than C-band (r: 0.68-0.70, MAE: 0.070.09 m(3)/m(3), RMSD: 0.09-0.10 m(3)/m(3)). Moreover, an intercomparison between different acquisition times (morning and evening) of AMSR2 X-band products found a better performance from evening overpasses (1:30 pm; r: 0.69-0.77) as opposed to morning overpasses (1:30 am; r: 0.47-0.66). In the case of SMOS, morning (6:00 am; r: 0.77) retrievals were found to be superior over evening (6:00 pm; r: 0.69) retrievals. Overall, both versions of JAXA products, the second and third versions of LPRM X-band products, and two versions of SMOS products were found to meet the mean average error (MAE) goal accuracy of the AMSR2 mission (MAE {\textless} 0.08 m(3)/m(3)) but none of the products achieved the SMOS goal of RMSD {\textless} 0.04 m(3)/m(3). Furthermore, performance of the products differed depending on the statistic used to evaluate them. Consequently, considering the results in this study, JX2 products are recommended if both absolute and temporal accuracy of the soil moisture product is of importance, whereas LP3(x) products from evening observations and SMOS version 3.00 (SMOS2) products from morning overpasses are recommended if temporal accuracy is of greater importance.

To further investigate the capacity of this method, we have undertaken an extensive field study using multifrequency (i.e., 225, 450, and 900 MHz) DGW measurements to monitor a complete annual cycle of soil water content variations typical of midlatitude climates at three sites with different soil textures. The use of common-midpoint surveys allowed us to understand the nature and evolution of the near-surface electromagnetic wavefields and their impact on DGW moisture predictions. We present the novel characterization of a wide-range of seasonal moisture dynamics including soil freezing and thawing process using multifrequency DGW measurements for a range of soil textures. These data showed significant temporal variations in both the near-surface wavefield and multifrequency DGW velocities corresponding to both seasonal and shorter-term variations in soil conditions. Although all of the measurement sites displayed similar temporal responses, the rate and magnitude of these velocity variations corresponded to varying soil water contents, which were controlled by the soil textural properties. Although there were no observed systematic differences in DGW velocities due to frequency dispersion for the 225-900 MHz range, the DGW measurements obtained using higher-frequency antennas was less impacted by near-surface wavefield interference due to their shorter signal pulse duration. DGW velocity measurements combined with an appropriate dielectric mixing formula provided quantitative predictions of soil water content that accurately replicated the soil sample data over the annual cycle of moisture conditions.},

However, this combined method is lengthy and time-consuming, and an approach to shorten these P desorption studies in soils was important. The major objective of this article, therefore, was to present a shortcut method as an alternative approach to the combined fractionation method.

Both these methods were correlated with maize grain yield, and it was found to be highly significant.

The MMF method is based on a complementary relationship hypothesis assuming SMC is reflected in the adjacent surface atmospheric moisture under midday conditions. By this method, daily passive SMC products from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission with 36-km resolution were disaggregated using a daily gridded meteorological data with nominal 4-km resolution. The original and downscaled SMCs were evaluated by comparing with in situ SMC obtained from three core validation sites and three sparse networks. The experiment was conducted in the central part of the U.S. from April 2015 to June 2018. Results demonstrated that the downscaled SMC maintained the dynamic range of original SMC product and energy was conserved. Furthermore, the downscaled SMC showed good agreement with and slightly outperformed the original SMC as compared with in situ SMC. The downscaling method is shown to capture higher resolution SMC spatial variability while preserving the quality of original SMC. However, because of the complexity of soil moisture-atmosphere interactions, the actual contributing domain of downscaled SMC may be greater than 4 km. The MMF method is suggested as a supplementary for all-weather downscaling coarse-resolution SMC.},

For this reason, the monitoring of surface parameters, particularly soil moisture, is very important. This paper presents a new methodology for the estimation of surface soil moisture over Western Africa based on the data provided by the European Remote Sensing wind scatterometer instrument, in which an empirical model is used to estimate volumetric soil moisture. This approach takes into account the effects of vegetation and soil roughness in the soil moisture estimation process. The proposed estimations have been validated using different methods, and a good degree of coherence has been observed between satellite estimations and ground truth measurements over the Banizambou site in Niger. Moisture and rainfall estimations for the same site are shown to be strongly correlated. Comparison with the multimodel analysis product provided by the Global Soil Wetness Project, Phase 2, indicates that their estimations are well correlated, although land surface models provide slightly overestimated levels of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical environmental variable, as it significantly affects infiltration, evapotranspiration and surface and subsurface runoff processes. Measurement of soil moisture, however, has only recently become possible over large scales. In modelling applications, the spatial distribution of soil moisture is typically assumed to mirror that of a terrain attribute such as the wetness index of [Beven KJ, Kirkby MJ. A physically based, variable contributing area model of basin hydrology. Hydrol Sci Bull 1979;24(1):43-69] (e.g. TOPMODEL [2]. Intense ground-based measurements of the spatial distribution of soil moisture in the root zone have been conducted in Australia and New Zealand, allowing examination of the predictive power of various terrain attributes with respect to soil moisture. Here a method is developed that enables the generation of realistic spatio-temporal patterns of soil moisture based on the changing importance of spatial attributes with average wetness condition (theta) over bar (t). Maps of terrain and other spatial attributes are combined and weighted according to relationships dependent on (theta) over bar (t) to generate simulated spatial patterns of soil moisture. The method is presently based on field data and requires spatial patterns of soil moisture for a range of (theta) over bar (t) conditions in order to establish relationships between (theta) over bar (t) and the attributes. Observed variability is introduced by adding an error term whose statistics are also a function of (theta) over bar (t). Ultimately generalised weightings could be derived, based on the literature or subjective assessment by the user. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper examines the applicability of estimating soil moisture states and soil hydraulic parameters through two particle filter (PF) methods: The PF with commonly used sampling importance resampling (PF-SIR) and the PF with recently developed Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling (PF-MCMC) methods. In a synthetic experiment, the potential of assimilating remotely sensed near-surface soil moisture measurements into a 1-D mechanistic soil water model (HYDRUS-1D) using both the PF-SIR and PF-MCMC algorithms is analyzed. The effects of satellite temporal resolution and accuracy, soil type, and ensemble size on the assimilation of soil moisture are analyzed. In a real data experiment, we first validate the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture products in the Oklahoma Little Washita Watershed. Aside from rescaling the remotely sensed soil moisture, a bias correction algorithm is implemented to correct the deep soil moisture estimate. Both the ascending and descending AMSR-E soil moisture data are assimilated into the HYDRUS-1D model. The synthetic assimilation results indicated that, whereas both updating schemes showed the ability to correct the soil moisture state and estimate hydraulic parameters, the PF-MCMC scheme is consistently more accurate than PR-SIR. For real data case, the quality of remotely sensed soil moisture impacts the benefits of their assimilation into the model. The PF-MCMC scheme brought marginal gains than the open-loop simulation in RMSE at both surface and root-zone soil layer, whereas the PF-SIR scheme degraded the open-loop simulation.},

	abstract = {Multiple soil moisture products have been generated from data acquired by satellite. However, these satellite soil moisture products are not spatially or temporally complete, primarily due to track changes, radio-frequency interference, dense vegetation, and frozen soil. These deficiencies limit the application of soil moisture in land surface process simulation, climatic modeling, and global change research. To fill the gaps and generate spatially and temporally complete soil moisture data, a data assimilation algorithm is proposed in this study. A soil moisture model is used to simulate soil moisture over time, and the shuffled complex evolution optimization method, developed at the University of Arizona, is used to estimate the control variables of the soil moisture model from good-quality satellite soil moisture data covering one year, so that the temporal behavior of the modeled soil moisture reaches the best agreement with the good-quality satellite soil moisture data. Soil moisture time series were then reconstructed by the soil moisture model according to the optimal values of the control variables. To analyze its performance, the data assimilation algorithm was applied to a daily soil moisture product derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the Microwave Radiometer Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). Preliminary analysis using soil moisture data simulated by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah model and soil moisture measurements at a multi-scale Soil Moisture and Temperature Monitoring Network on the central Tibetan Plateau (CTP-SMTMN) was performed to validate this method. The results show that the data assimilation algorithm can efficiently reconstruct spatially and temporally complete soil moisture time series. The reconstructed soil moisture data are consistent with the spatial precipitation distribution and have strong positive correlations with the values simulated by the GLDAS Noah model over large areas of the region. Compared to the soil moisture measurements at the medium and large networks, the reconstructed soil moisture data have almost the same accuracy as the soil moisture product derived from AMSR-E/MWRI/AMSR2 for ascending and descending orbits.},

This study developed a new approach for derivation of the SMR recovery curve (R-curve) at sub-daily time-scales using the Curve Number (CN) method. The methodology was applied using complex storm events in the Napa River basin, California. The R-curve is classified into three sections depending on the recovery rate of SMR during the inter-storm interval of no rain (INR), and this study defines the characteristics. The first section of the R-curve (INR 0-21 h with 0.97 mm/h) is described as gradually recovering SMR, since water is being infiltrated and the upper soil layer is not fully saturated. The second section (INR 21-36 h with 2.11 mm/h) is defined as steeply recovering S due to downward drainage (sub-surface/inter flows) and evaporation without infiltration. The third section (INR 36-68 h with 0.34 mm/h) is described as gradually decreasing recovery dependent on evaporation since percolation and drainage have almost stopped.},

The objectives of this study were to: (i) establish site-specific laboratory calibration equations of three single capacitance sensors (EC-20, EC-10, and ML2x) for tropical soils, and (ii) evaluate the accuracy and precision of these sensors. Intact soil cores and bulk samples, collected from the top 20 and 80 cm soil depths at five locations across the Upper Makaha Valley watershed, were analyzed to determine their soil bulk density (rho(b)), total porosity (theta(t)), particle size distribution, and electrical conductivity (EC). Laboratory calibration equations were established using soil packed columns at six water content levels (0-0.5 cm(3) cm(-3)). Soil bulk density and theta(t) significantly varied with sampling depths; whereas, soil clay content (CC) and EC varied with sampling locations. Variations of rho(b) and theta(t) at the two depths significantly affected the EC-20 and ML2x laboratory calibration functions; however, there was no effect of these properties on calibration equation functions of EC-10. There was no significant effect of sampling locations on the laboratory calibration functions suggesting watershed-specific equations for EC-20 and ML2x for the two depths; a single watershed-specific equation was needed for EC-10 for both sampling depths. The laboratory calibration equations for all sensors were more accurate than the corresponding default equations. ML2x exhibited better precision than EC-10, followed by EC-20. We conclude that the laboratory calibration equations can mitigate the effects of varying soil properties and improve the sensors' accuracy for water content measurements.},

The challenge for retrieval algorithms is to identify and isolate precipitation profiles whose simulated observations agree with the satellite observations and are also representative of the surface conditions. Microwave emissivity modeling results are presented from a physically based land algorithm that retrieves soil moisture, vegetation water content, and surface temperature, along with the emissivity using polarized 10, 18, and 37 GHz channel measurements from the WindSat sensor onboard the Coriolis satellite, and results from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Microwave Imager (TMI).

We developed a sensor to detect SM from four soil depths (10, 20, 40, and 60 cm) simultaneously by using the TDM technique. This is a type of EM sensor that indirectly estimates the SM on the basis of the dielectric properties of soil. Three types of soil samples were used to calibrate the sensor. The calibration models were established using polynomial (3rd order) fitting equations. The performance of the sensor was evaluated both in the laboratory and in situ conditions. The sensitivity of the sensor was examined in a micro-control irrigation system. The sensor measured SM contents in a soil box were compared with HYDRUS-2D simulated wetting patterns. The results were in the optimal range, and the coefficient of determination (R-2) ranged from 0.97 to 0.99 and root means square error (RMSE) from 0.72 to 2.01. The IDM detection circuit-based sensor R-2 value was 0.97, and its RMSE was 2.78. Whereas the independent detection circuit R-2 values ranged from 0.93 to 0.96 and RMSE from 4.09 to 5.07. The results determined that the sensor could be used for continuous SM measurements, which would be advantageous for planning the irrigation practices in arid and irrigated regions.},

	abstract = {Recently improved ECH2O soil moisture sensors have received significant attention in many field and laboratory applications. Focusing on the EC-5 sensor, a simple and robust calibration method is proposed. The sensor-to-sensor variability in the readings (analog-to-digital converter (ADC) counts) among 30 EC-5 sensors was relatively small but not negligible. A large number of ADC counts were taken under various volumetric water contents (theta) using four test sands. The proposed two-point alpha-mixing model, as well as linear and quadratic models, was fitted to the ADC-theta data. Unlike for conventional TDR measurements, the effect of sensor characteristics is lumped into the empirical parameter a in the two-point alpha-mixing model. The value of a was fitted to be 2.5, yielding a nearly identical calibration curve to the quadratic model. Errors in theta associated with the sensor-to-sensor variability for the two-point alpha-mixing model were +/- 0.005 cm(3) cm(-3) for dry sand and +/- 0.028 cm(3) cm(-3) for saturated sand. In the validation experiments, the highest accuracy in water content estimation was achieved when sensor-specific ADC(dry) and ADC(sat) were used in the two-point alpha-mixing model. Assuming that alpha = 2.5 is valid for most mineral soils, the two-point alpha-mixing model only requires the measurement of two extreme ADC counts in dry and saturated soils. Sensor-specific ADC(dry) and ADC(sat) counts are readily measured in most cases. Therefore, the two-point alpha-mixing model (with alpha = 2.5) can be considered as a quick, easy, and robust method for calibrating the ECH2O EC-5 sensor. Although further investigation is needed, the two-point alpha-mixing model may also be applied to calibrating other sensors.},

Preplant soil samples (top 15-cm) were collected from the potato year of a rotation trial in Maine during 2004 and 2005. Treatments included three crop rotations, with and without a history of organic amendment [solid beef (Bos taurus) manure] application: PB, potato-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); PSPB, potato-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-potato-barley; and PSBA/T, potato-soybean-barley-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/timothy (Phleum pratense L.). The No and mineralizable N pools were determined by aerobic incubation at 25 degrees C and periodic leaching for 24 wk with a fixed-k approach. On average, historically amended soil had 35\% higher values of N-0, and an 8\% higher proportion of mineralizable N partitioned to the stable mineralizable N pool, compared with nonamended soil. Lower values of N-0, mineralizable N pools and some measures of N availability were measured in PSBA/T compared with PB and PSPB rotations. All tested measures of N availability detected management-induced changes in No and mineralizable N pools. The preplant nitrate, UV absorbance of 0.01 MNaHCO3 extract at 205 nm and particulate organic matter (POM)-N were the best predictors of field-based indices of soil N supply (r(2) = 0.50 to 0.73). Management-induced changes in the size and quality of mineralizable N should be considered in developing best N management programs through organic amendment application and crop rotations.},

	abstract = {Calibration/validation experiments are critical to developing and testing soil moisture retrieval algorithms from microwave remote sensing platforms. Ground sampling must be optimally designed to minimize sources of error or bias during data collection. An important consideration in the design of ground sampling campaigns is that the in situ measured soil moisture is representative of the retrieval depth of a microwave sensor. Because of the popularity of portable impedance probe instruments, volumetric soil moisture is usually measured at a constant depth of approximately 0 to 6 cm and aggregated over a spatial extent representative of a pixel footprint. However, the retrieval depth of microwave signals can vary, and in agricultural soils is typically representative of the top similar to 5 cm (or less) of the soil surface. It is unknown whether this mismatch between the depth of ground measured soil moisture and microwave retrieved soil moisture significantly contributes to error during sensor calibration/validation. This issue is addressed based on an analysis of over 3400 impedance probe measurements collected in 72 agricultural fields over four sampling occasions. Volumetric soil moisture was measured at depths of approximately 6 and 3 cm, at 24 locations in each field. The observed soil moisture sampling distributions and statistical moments are compared between these two measurement depths. Results demonstrate that the majority of fields exhibit a near-normal sampling distribution at both the 6- (60 of 72) and 3-cm (59 of 72) depths. An average difference of 0.016 m(3) m(-3) exists between all field means, generally indicating that wetter measurements are observed from the samples at 6 cm than those at 3 cm. Statistically significant differences were found between the measurement depths for field means (23 of 72), distributions (21 of 72), and variances (9 of 72). These findings demonstrate the importance of recognizing near-surface volumetric soil moisture spatial and depth variability effects during ground sampling experiments to minimize error in calibration/validation of retrieval algorithms.},

Both salts contained in the irrigation water and temperature might alter the soil water content (SWC) sensed by SMSs. The objective of this research was to quantify the effect of salinity and/or temperature on the precision and accuracy of three different commercially available SMSs. The brands, controllers, and probes selected for this experiment were as follows: Acclima, SCX, and Digital TDT, Baseline, WaterTec S100, and biSensor, and Dynamax, IL200-MC, and SM200. Every SMS was replicated three times. Each SMS probe was installed in the center of different containers filled with an Arredondo fine sand. The containers were placed in a controlled-temperature chamber and were saturated and dried down across a combination of three temperatures (10, 25, or 35 degrees C) and three electrical conductivities (0, 0.7, or 5dS/m). Each container was placed on a platform scale to determine soil water losses, by weight variation over time. The actual or measured SWCs were then compared with their respective SMS readings. A regression analysis was performed, per brand, for each combination of salinity and temperature. Acclima resulted in the most robust and reliable system, with no practical reading variations when exposed to different combinations of temperatures and salinities. Both Baseline and Dynamax systems were sensitive to high salinity and/or high temperature, making their use more difficult in extreme or changing situations. However, all tested SMSs followed with adequate precision the SWC under the different salinity and temperature scenarios. Consequently, these SMSs might achieve an adequate landscape irrigation control, even when their readings might not correspond to the actual SWC. (C) 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Climate change is significantly altering rainfall patterns globally and will likely cause increases in extreme rainfall events. Grassland systems are particularly vulnerable to these changes as their productivity is strongly mediated by soil water content (SWC). SWC mean and variability are driven by the amount of rainfall received as well as the distribution through time of that rainfall. In this study, we used a model grassland system in a controlled glasshouse experiment to identify whether SWC mean or variability is a stronger driver of productivity. We then examined how extreme rainfall events alter this driver and the resulting effect this has on productivity and biomass allocation under ambient and elevated carbon dioxide (CO2). Rainfall amount was held constant, but distribution through time varied (control, one in 20years event, one in 100years event). SWC variability was a stronger driver of productivity (mesocosm biomass) than SWC mean, with increasing extreme rainfall event magnitude resulting in greater SWC variability. Surprisingly, elevated CO2 only had a small effect on these productivity and biomass allocation responses which may be due to the relatively small CO2 difference tested. Our results suggest that distribution of rainfall in time is an important driver of grassland productivity and that increases in extreme rainfall events, for a given total rainfall, will result in reduced grassland productivity.},

	abstract = {In this study, the feasibility of using inverse vadose zone modeling for estimating field-scale actual evapotranspiration (ETa) was explored at a long-term agricultural monitoring site in eastern Nebraska. Data from both point-scale soil water content (SWC) sensors and the area-average technique of cosmic-ray neutron probes were evaluated against independent ETa estimates from a co-located eddy covariance tower. While this methodology has been successfully used for estimates of groundwater recharge, it was essential to assess the performance of other components of the water balance such as ETa. In light of recent evaluations of land surface models (LSMs), independent estimates of hydrologic state variables and fluxes are critically needed benchmarks. The results here indicate reasonable estimates of daily and annual ETa from the point sensors, but with highly varied soil hydraulic function parameterizations due to local soil texture variability. The results of multiple soil hydraulic parameterizations leading to equally good ETa estimates is consistent with the hydrological principle of equifinality. While this study focused on one particular site, the framework can be easily applied to other SWC monitoring networks across the globe. The value-added products of groundwater recharge and ETa flux from the SWC monitoring networks will provide additional and more robust benchmarks for the validation of LSM that continues to improve their forecast skill. In addition, the value-added products of groundwater recharge and ETa often have more direct impacts on societal decision-making than SWC alone. Water flux impacts human decision-making from policies on the long-term management of groundwater resources (recharge), to yield forecasts (ETa) and to optimal irrigation scheduling (ETa) Illustrating the societal benefits of SWC monitoring is critical to insure the continued operation and expansion of these public datasets.},

Key components of DANUBIA in respect to water quality and plant growth modelling are nitrogen turnover, nitrogen fluxes and storages. This paper discusses an approach to model soil nitrogen dynamics in a mesoscale watershed. Within the model, the soil column is represented by three soil layers. The model components for water fluxes, nitrogen uptake and nitrogen transformation are process-based. To validate the model, field data from four locations were used. Nitrogen modelling results are in good agreement with measured data. Statistical analysis for soil nitrogen and water content resulted in satisfactory indices of agreement. The study demonstrated that the coupled soil moisture and soil nitrogen transformation model is suitable to simulate the fate of mineral nitrogen within the soil profile on the field scale. Sensitivity studies indicate that the model quality for large scale modelling depends particularly upon the appropriate representation of sandy soils, the accurate parameterization of the saturated hydraulic conductivity and the precise initialization of soil mineral nitrogen content.

	abstract = {The need for accurate, real-time, reliable, and multi-scale soil water content (SWC) monitoring is critical for a multitude of scientific disciplines trying to understand and predict the Earth's terrestrial energy, water, and nutrient cycles. One promising technique to help meet this demand is fixed and roving cosmic-ray neutron probes (CRNPs). However, the relationship between observed low-energy neutrons and SWC is affected by local soil and vegetation calibration parameters. This effect may be accounted for by a calibration equation based on local soil type and the amount of vegetation. However, determining the calibration parameters for this equation is labor- and time-intensive, thus limiting the full potential of the roving CRNP in large surveys and long transects, or its use in novel environments. In this work, our objective is to develop and test the accuracy of globally available datasets (clay weight percent, soil bulk density, and soil organic carbon) to support the operability of the roving CRNP. Here, we develop a 1 km product of soil lattice water over the continental United States (CONUS) using a database of in situ calibration samples and globally available soil taxonomy and soil texture data. We then test the accuracy of the global dataset in the CONUS using comparisons from 61 in situ samples of clay percent (RMSE = 5.45 wt \%, R-2 = 0.68), soil bulk density (RMSE = 0.173 g cm(-3), R-2 = 0.203), and soil organic carbon (RMSE = 1.47 wt \%, R-2 = 0.175). Next, we conduct an uncertainty analysis of the global soil calibration parameters using a Monte Carlo error propagation analysis (maximum RMSE similar to 0.035 cm(3) cm(-3) at a SWC = 0.40 cm(3) cm(-3)). In terms of vegetation, fast- growing crops (i.e., maize and soybeans), grasslands, and forests contribute to the CRNP signal primarily through the water within their biomass and this signal must be accounted for accurate estimation of SWC. We estimated the biomass water signal by using a vegetation index derived from MODIS imagery as a proxy for standing wet biomass (RMSE {\textless} 1 kgm(-2)). Lastly, we make recommendations on the design and validation of future roving CRNP experiments.},

	abstract = {Soil compaction caused by traffic of heavy vehicles and machinery has become a problem of world-wide concern. The aims of this study were to evaluate and compare the changes in bulk density, soil strength, porosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and air permeability during sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) harvesting on a typical Bavarian soil (Regosol) as well as to assess the most appropriate variable factors that fit with the effective controlling of subsequent compaction. The field experiments, measurements and laboratory testing were carried out in Freising, Germany. Two tillage systems (conventional plough tillage and reduced chisel tillage) were used in the experiments. The soil water contents were adjusted to 0.17 g g(-1) (w(1)), 0.27 g g(-1) (w(2)) and 0.35 g g(-1) (w(3)). Taking the increase in bulk density, the decrease in air permeability and reduction of wide coarse pore size porosity (-6 kPa) into account, it seems that CT (ploughing to a depth of 0.25 m followed by two passes of rotary harrow to a depth 0.05 m) of plots were compacted to a depth of at least 0.25 m and at most 0.40 m in high soil water (w(3)) conditions. The trends were similar for “CT w(1)” (low soil water content) plots. However, it seems that “CT w(1)” plots were less affected than “CT w(3)” plots with regard to bulk density increases under partial load. In contrast, diminishments of wide coarse pores (-6 kPa) and narrow (tight) coarse pores (-30 kPa) were significantly higher in “CT w(1)” plots down to 0.4 m. Among CT plots, the best physical properties were obtained at medium soil water (w(2)) content. No significant increase in bulk density and no significant decrease in coarse pore size porosity and total porosity below 0.2 m were observed at medium soil water content. The soil water content seemed to be the most decisive factor. It is likely that, CS (chiselling to a depth of 0.13 m followed by two passes of rotary harrow to a depth 0.05 m) plots were less affected by traffic treatments than CT plots. Considering the proportion of coarse pore size porosity (structural porosity) and total porosity, no compaction effects below 0.3 m were found. Medium soil water content (w(2)) provides better soil conditions after traffic with regard to wide coarse pore size porosity (-6 kPa), air permeability (at 6 and 30 kPa water suction), total porosity and bulk density. Proportion of wide coarse pores, air permeability and bulk density seems to be suitable parameters to detect soil compaction under the conditions tested. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A large-scale re-vegetation supported by the Grain for Green Project (GGP) has greatly changed local eco-hydrological systems, with an impact on soil moisture conditions for the Chinese Loess Plateau. It is important to know how, exactly, re-vegetation influences soil moisture conditions, which not only crucially constrain growth and distribution of vegetation, and hence, further re-vegetation, but also determine the degree of soil desiccation and, thus, erosion risk in the region. In this study, three eco-environmental factors, which are Soil Water Index (SWI), the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), and precipitation, were used to investigate the response of soil moisture in the one-meter layer of top soil to the re-vegetation during the GGP. SWI was estimated based on the backscatter coefficient produced by the European Remote Sensing Satellite (ERS-1/2) and Meteorological Operational satellite program (MetOp), while NDVI was derived from SPOT imageries. Two separate periods, which are 1998-2000 and 2008-2010, were selected to examine the spatiotemporal pattern of the chosen eco-environmental factors. It has been shown that the amount of precipitation in 1998-2000 was close to that of 2008-2010 (the difference being 13.10 mm). From 1998-2000 to 2008-2010, the average annual NDVI increased for 80.99\%, while the SWI decreased for 72.64\% of the area on the Loess Plateau. The average NDVI over the Loess Plateau increased rapidly by 17.76\% after the 10-year GGP project. However, the average SWI decreased by 4.37\% for two-thirds of the area. More specifically, 57.65\% of the area on the Loess Plateau experienced an increased NDVI and decreased SWI, 23.34\% of the area had an increased NDVI and SWI. NDVI and SWI decreased simultaneously for 14.99\% of the area, and the decreased NDVI and increased SWI occurred at the same time for 4.02\% of the area. These results indicate that re-vegetation, human activities, and climate change have impacts on soil moisture. However, re-vegetation, which consumes a large quantity of soil water, may be the major factor for soil moisture change in most areas of the Loess Plateau. It is, therefore, suggested that Soil Moisture Content (SMC) should be kept in mind when carrying out re-vegetation in China's arid and semi-arid regions.},

This research aims to investigate such relationships and choose a drought indicator that best correlates with soil moisture observed at various depths from the soil climate analysis network (SCAN) sites, with 0-64 days of lagging periods. Results from the study show that the indicators applied to corn led to statistically significant correlations with soil moisture at deeper depths and also the soil moisture memory can be kept for a long period of time (32-48 days), while the indicators applied to soybeans correlated best with soil moisture at shallower depths and the soil moisture memory can only be kept for a short time (concurrent to 16 days).},

Three daily LAI time series derived from different empirical NDVI-LAI relationships using the MODIS NDVI data were used in the analysis. Calibration results from both models consistently suggested that an average LAI over time, rather than a time varying daily LAI, was sufficient to reproduce daily soil moisture at our site. We did, however, find that the sensitivity of the impact of LAI time variability on soil moisture estimation was a function of soil parameters. The influence of LAI time variation on the soil moisture simulations is controlled by the sensitivity of modelled soil moisture to the average LAI values over that period, and soil parameters affected the sensitivity of the model to LAI. Those parameter sets that were most sensitive to the long-term mean LAI were also those that were the most sensitive to the time variability. In our case, model calibrations using a constant LAI adjusted the soil parameters to reduce the impact of LAI variability. Results also suggested that the LAI variability could be significant if the varying LAI approached a very low level (i.e. LAI {\textless} 1) for a significant proportion of the simulation period. This is most likely to be the case for short grasses in grasslands. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Soil moisture closely correlates radar scattering coefficient, and a simplified inversion model was built based on a backscattering coefficient extracted from multi-polarization data of ALOS/PALSAR and in situ soil moisture measured by a time domain reflectometer to detect soil moisture variations. The result indicated a higher accuracy of soil moisture inversion by the HH polarization mode than those by the HV mode. Soil salinity is reflected by soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa). Further, ECa can be rapidly detected by EM38 equipment in situ linked with GPS for characterizing the spatial variability of soil salinity. Based on the strong spatial variability and interactions of soil moisture and salinity, a cokriging interpolation method with auxiliary variable of backscattering coefficient was adopted to map the spatial variability of ECa. When compared with a map of ECa interpolated by the ordinary kriging method, detail was revealed and the accuracy was increased by 15.3\%. The results conclude that the integrating active remote sensing and proximal sensors EM38 are effective and acceptable approaches for rapidly and accurately detecting soil moisture and salinity variability in coastal areas, especially in the subtropical coastal zones of China with frequent heavy cloud cover.},

The assimilation of different data sources for the production of daily soil moisture and temperature analyses is investigated in a set of observing system simulation experiments over North America. A simplified variational technique is adapted to accommodate different observation types at their appropriate time in a 24-h time window. The screen-level observations of temperature and relative humidity, from conventional synoptic surface observations (SYNOP)/aviation routine weather report (METAR)/surface aviation observation (SA) reports, are considered together with presently available satellite observations provided by the Aqua satellite (microwave C-band), Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) [ infrared (IR)], and observations available in the future by the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite mission (microwave L-band). The aim of these experiments is to assess the information content brought by each observation type in the land surface analysis. The observation systems are simulated according to their spatial coverage, temporal availability, and nominal or expected errors. The results show that the observable with the largest dynamical response to perturbations of the control variable carries the greatest information content into the analysis. The observational error and the observation frequency counterbalance this feature in the analysis. If one considers a single observation both for soil moisture and soil temperature analysis, then satellite measurements (L-band, C-band, and IR in decreasing order of importance) are the primary source of information. When observation availability is considered and the highest temporal frequency of screen-level observations is used (1 h), a large amount of information is extracted from SYNOP-like reports. The screen-level observations are shown to provide valuable soil moisture information mainly during the daytime, while during nighttime these observations (and particularly screen-level temperature) are mostly useful for the soil temperature analysis. The results are presented with perspectives for future operational developments},

However, the effects of multiresolution imagery on modeling of biogeochemical soil properties in aquatic ecosystems are still poorly understood. The objectives of this study were the following: 1) to develop prediction models for soil total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen (TN) utilizing RS images and environmental ancillary data at three different resolutions; 2) to identify controlling factors of the spatial distribution of soil TP and TN; and 3) to elucidate the effects of different spatial resolutions of RS images on inferential modeling. Soil cores were collected (n = 108) from the top 10 cm in a subtropical wetland: Water Conservation Area-2A, the Florida Everglades, USA. The spectral data and derived indices from RS images, which have different spatial resolutions, included the following: MODIS (500 m resampled to 250 m), Landsat ETM+ (30 m), and SPOT (10 m). Block kriging and random forest (RF) were employed to predict soil TP and TN using RS-image-derived spectral input variables, environmental ancillary data, and soil observations. The RF models showed R-2 between 0.90 and 0.93 and root mean square error between 100.4 and 115.9 mg.kg(-1) for TP and between 1.45 and 1.52 g.kg(-1) for TN. Soil TP was mainly predicted from RS-derived spectral indices that infer on biotic/vegetation characteristics, whereas soil TN was predicted using a combination of biotic/vegetation, topographic, and hydrologic variables. Results suggest that the spectral data informed soil models have excellent predictive capabilities in this aquatic ecosystem. Interestingly, there was no noticeable distinction among different spatial resolutions of RS images to develop prediction models for soil TP and TN in terms of error assessment. However, the variability and complexity of soil TP and TN variations were much better expressed with the finer resolution RFSPOT model than the coarser resolution RFMODIS model as demonstrated using entropy.},

The evaluation was performed in terms of relative soil moisture values (\%), as well as anomalies from the seasonal cycle. Considering the high radiometric noise of the ASAR GM data, the SSM product exhibits a good ability (Pearson correlation coefficient (R) = similar to 0.6 for relative soil moisture values and root mean square difference (RMSD) = 11\% when averaged to 5-km resolution) to monitor temporal soil moisture variability in regions with low to medium density vegetation and yearly rainfall {\textgreater}250 mm. The findings agree with previous evaluation studies performed over Australia and further strengthen the understanding of the quality of the ASAR GM SSM product and its potential for data assimilation. Problems identified in the ASAR GM algorithm over arid regions were explained by azimuthal effects. Diverse backscatter behavior over different soil types was identified. The insights gained about the quality of the data were used to establish a reliable masking of the existing ASAR GM SSM product and the identification of areas where further research is needed for the future Sentinel-1-derived SSM products.},

The soils are represented by a Luvisol derived from loess and a Vertisol developed from claystone. The soil properties of the two monitoring sites measured immediately after changing to organic farming showed high contents of extractable nutrients as a result of the former intensive fertilization practice during conventional farm management. The microbial soil properties of the two monitoring sites were in the medium range of regional soils. A first evaluation of the development of soil properties was done after 5 y of monitoring. The soil organic-matter content increased slightly after grass-clover and after application of farmyard manure. The amounts of K and P decreased clearly at the loess site without application of farmyard manure. At the clay site, the unique application of farmyard manure led to increasing contents of extractable K and P in the top soil. The variation of soil properties increased clearly after perennial crops like grass-clover and in years after application of farmyard manure.},

In this study, in situ and remote sensing information of near-surface soil moisture is assimilated into the Noah land surface model (LSM) to estimate deep-layer soil moisture variation. The sequential Monte Carlo-Particle Filter technique, being well known for capability of modeling high nonlinear and non-Gaussian processes, is applied to assimilate surface soil moisture measurement to the deep layers. The experiments were carried out over several locations over the semi-arid region of the US. Comparing with in situ observations, the assimilation runs show much improved from the control (non-assimilation) runs for estimating both soil moisture and temperature at 5-, 20-, and 50-cm soil depths in the Noah LSM.},

In order to provide robust soil moisture and property estimates, we first proposed an adaptive particle batch smoother algorithm (APBS). In the APBS, a tuning factor, which can avoid severe particle weight degeneration, is automatically determined by maximizing the reliability of the soil temperature estimates of each batch window. A multiple truth synthetic test was used to demonstrate the APBS can robustly estimate soil moisture and properties using observed soil temperatures at two shallow depths. The APBS algorithm was then applied to DTS data along a 71 m transect, yielding an hourly soil moisture map with meter resolution. Results show the APBS can draw the prior guessed soil hydraulic and thermal properties significantly closer to the field measured reference values. The improved soil properties in turn remove the soil moisture biases between the prior guessed and reference soil moisture, which was particularly noticeable at depth above 20 cm. This high-resolution soil moisture map demonstrates the potential of characterizing soil moisture temporal and spatial variability and reflects patterns consistent with previous studies conducted using intensive point scale soil moisture samples. The intermediate scale high spatial resolution soil moisture information derived from the DTS may facilitate remote sensing soil moisture product calibration and validation. In addition, the APBS algorithm proposed in this study would also be applicable to general hydrological data assimilation problems for robust model state and parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Determining the best way to efficiently use limited water resources, for food and energy-dedicated crops, has become crucial due to the rise in extreme events (floods/droughts) and higher variability in rainfall attributed to global climate change. Changing climate conditions will require new crops to be adapted to a changing agricultural environment. Reliable information on seasonal trends in crop growth and evapotranspiration with associated uncertainty/confidence ranges is crucial to guide the development of new crops and management strategies to cope with future climate. Given that crop growth is strongly coupled to soil moisture, developing reliable growth curves requires a detailed understanding of soil moisture at the field-scale. Typically, it is impractical to collect soil samples to adequately assess soil moisture that represents both spatial distribution at the field-scale and temporal dynamics on the scale of a growing season (e.g. 110 days for cereals). A novel way to address soil moisture monitoring challenges is through an integrated, agro-ecosystems-level approach using an integrated sensing system that can link data from multiple platforms (wireless sensors, satellites, airborne imagery, near real-time climate stations). Assimilated data can, then, be fed into predictive models to generate reference crop growth curves and predict regionally-specific yield potentials. However, integrated sensing requires interagency cooperation, common data processing standards and long-term, timely access to data. Large databases need to be reusable by various organizations and accessible, in the future, with comprehensive metadata. During the 2012 growing season a feasibility study was conducted which involved measuring field-scale soil moisture with sensor network technology. The experiment utilized radially-distributed sensors for tracking in-season soil moisture. OpenGIS-compliant services and standards were utilized to provide long-term access to sensor data and construct corresponding metadata. Sensor Model Language, an inter-operable metadata format, was used to create documentation for the sensor system and sensing components. Two different third party implementations of the Sensor Observation Service were tested for providing long-term access to the data. This work discusses a set of key recommendations for monitoring field-scale soil moisture dynamics for integration with remote sensing and models, including: (1) Improved in situ sensing technology that would allow for less restrictive soil moisture measurements. (2) Integration of field-scale in situ networks with regional remote sensing monitoring. (3) The development of software and web services to integrate data from multiple sources with models for decision support. (C) 2014 Crown Copyright and Elsevier B.V. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Here we present a physics-based approach to infer the moisture and ionic concentration in the soil from in-situ, multi-frequency measurements of the impedance of a metamaterial-inspired sensing element buried underground. Such model holds the advantage over empirical models by obviating the need to redo the calibration for different soil types. Our method involves performing an inversion analysis on the Bruggeman's dielectric mixing model. Under the quasi-static assumption, the approach predicts volumetric moisture content and ion concentration with 90\% accuracy in terms of the molar fraction of total volume for silver nitrate concentrations of 0 to 100 mM. We observed that soil conductivity is near-linear to the inferred ionic concentration for a given saline water fraction in the soil. The model has been validated by making multi-frequency impedance measurements of a soil mixture at different concentrations comprising of various constituents of soil, air, water, and ions.},

A relative signal-to-noise ratio (rSNR) value from a CyGNSS-derived delay-Doppler map is introduced to improve the temporal resolution of SM derived from Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data. We then evaluated the CyGNSS-derived rSNR using ground-based SM measurements and the triple collocation method with SMAP and modeled SM products. We found that CyGNSS can provide useful SM estimates over moderately vegetated regions (correlation coefficient of the individual data: 0.77) but shows degraded performance over arid and densely vegetated regions (correlation coefficient of the individual data: 0.68 and 0.67). However, when rSNR data is combined with SM data from SMAP, daily SM estimates can be achieved. These results show that synergistic use of CyGNSS observations can improve on SM estimates from current satellite systems. Plain Language Summary Accurate climate forecasting affects our daily lives. Large-scale farmers depend on weather forecasts to decide when to plant their crops. Bad timing can impact the whole years' harvest and thus the farmers' livelihoods. Even more importantly, people who live in floodplains and hurricane zones trust their lives to accurate weather forecasts. For these reasons and more, hydrologists need up-to-date knowledge of Earth's climate systems. And one of the most important sources of data may surprise you. The amount of moisture in just the first 8mm of topsoil affects all of Earth's climate systems. Currently, National Aeronautics and Space Administration keeps track of soil moisture levels with a satellite called Soil Moisture Active Passive. However, it only provides soil moisture data every 2-3 days. We believe that we can do better, and we believe that we can do it with preexisting satellite systems. In 2017, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) launched eight microsatellites, called Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CyGNSS), to predict cyclone paths. We have found that while the CyGNSS satellites are predicting cyclone paths, they can simultaneously measure changes in soil moisture around 5 times per day. Augmenting the Soil Moisture Active Passive data with CyGNSS would give us detailed prediction of weather changes in near-real time, protecting livelihoods and lives.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important environmental variable that impacts military operations and weapons systems. Accurate and timely forecasts of soil moisture at appropriate spatial scales, therefore, are important for mission planning. We present an application of a soil moisture data assimilation system to military trafficability assessment. The data assimilation system combines hillslope-scale (e.g., lOs to 100s of m) estimates of soil moisture from a hydrologic model with synthetic L-band microwave radar observations broadly consistent with the planned NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. Soil moisture outputs from the data assimilation system are input to a simple index-based model for vehicle trafficability. Since the data assimilation system uses the ensemble Kalman Filter, the risks of impaired trafficability due to uncertainties in the observations and model inputs can be quantified. Assimilating the remote sensing observations leads to significantly different predictions of trafficability conditions and associated risk of impaired trafficability, compared to an approach that propagates forward uncertainties in model inputs without assimilation. Specifically, assimilating the observations is associated with an increase in the risk of “slow go” conditions in approximately two-thirds of the watershed, and an increase in the risk of “no go” conditions in approximately 40\% of the watershed. Despite the simplicity of the trafficability assessment tool, results suggest that ensemble-based data assimilation can potentially improve trafficability assessment by constraining predictions to observations and facilitating quantitative assessment of the risk of impaired trafficability.

In particular, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT and single polarization ASAR images were used. During acquisitions of SAR over the test area in Alto Adige, Sudtirol region, northern Italy, extensive field measurements were carried out to characterize the area in terms of soil moisture variability, vegetation cover and soil properties. The area is equipped with 17 meteorological stations that also provide information on soil moisture on an hourly basis. To deal with the process of soil moisture retrieval from SAR images in this challenging environment, an advanced algorithm based on the support vector regression (SVR) technique and the integration of ancillary data were successfully proposed. The selected method was also combined with an innovative multi-objective strategy for model selection. The results indicate that the use of polarimetric features such as horizontal-horizontal polarization (HH) and horizontal-vertical polarization (HV) channels improves the estimation of SMC in the mountain area investigated, in particular because the HV channel contributes to disentangling the effect of vegetation on the radar signal. The root mean square error (RMSE) indicates accuracy of retrieval for soil moisture values of around 5\%, which is well within the requirements for estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed data. This work was carried out with the main aim of demonstrating the feasibility of soil moisture retrieval in mountain areas with high-resolution images in view of the upcoming Sentinel 1 mission.},

We develop a new LDAS that can improve the skill of an ecohydrological model to simulate simultaneously surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and vegetation dynamics by assimilating passive microwave observations that are sensitive to both surface soil moisture and terrestrial biomass. This LDAS first calibrates both hydrological and ecological parameters of a land surface model, which explicitly simulates vegetation growth and senescence. Then, it adjusts the model states of soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) sequentially using a genetic particle filter. We can adjust the subsurface soil moisture, which is not observed directly by satellites, because we simulate the interactions between vegetation dynamics and subsurface water dynamics. From a point-scale evaluation, we succeed in improving the performance of our land surface model and generate ensembles of the model state whose distribution reflects the combined information in the land surface model and satellite observations. We show that the adjustment of the subsurface soil moisture significantly improves the capacity to simulate vegetation dynamics in seasonal forecast timescales.

	abstract = {Initial catchment state, such as soil moisture, strongly controls rainfall-runoff transformation processes. However, due to the high spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, point measurements may not always be suitable to represent the actual system state of a whole catchment as required in distributed catchment modelling. In this study a fuzzy rule-based system (FRBS) using the Takagi-Sugeno-Kang approach has been developed using soil moisture and rainfall as input variables to predict the actual discharge at the catchment outlet. Four soil moisture probes from the hydrological test site Durreych (Black Forest, southwest Germany) were selected, each of them representing a particular runoff generation process (saturation excess flow, infiltration excess flow, slow and fast interflow, return flow). After manual calibration, the simulated peak discharges were very similar to the measured values. Furthermore, the pattern of rule activation in the FRBS reflected the complex, highly nonlinear behaviour of the catchment. Thus, in the FRBS framework, the measurements of soil moisture at representative locations could be used as representation for the actual system state, allowing for an entirely data-driven prediction of the runoff response using rainfall.},

	abstract = {This study presents indexes developed from remote sensing observations for continuous soil surface moisture monitoring. The Modified Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) proposed in our earlier work is developed using a time domain solution method rather than the traditional spatial domain solution method, because of limitations arising from a traditional temperature-vegetation index (TVX) method. In the procedure herein proposed, the MTVDI parameterization scheme is transformed from regional scale to pixel scale, and the boundary conditions defining maximum water stress are determined pixel by pixel using the surface energy balance principle. All the parameters required for the retrieval of MTVDI are pixel specific, thereby avoiding the limitations of the traditional spatial domain solution method. Previous studies demonstrate the applicability of the TVX method with data from only a few days of clear sky conditions. In contrast, our proposed MTVDI is demonstrated using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the course of a full year, and the soil moisture status over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) region is monitored continuously. Finally, the volumetric surface soil water content (theta(nu)) is estimated using a calibration procedure from the MTVDI retrievals. The results show that the accuracy of both MTVDI retrievals and theta(nu) estimates obtained in this work has reached a level comparable with those produced in previous studies. Across all sites, the correlation coefficient (r) between the MTVDI and theta(nu) measurements is 0.60. The values of r, mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) for theta(nu) estimates are 0.75, 0.019 m(3) M-3 and 0.025 m(3) m(-3), respectively.},

Treatments consisted in the succession of soybean (summer) and a mixed pasture of black oat + Italian ryegrass (winter), under different beef-cattle grazing intensities: intensive grazing, with 0.10-m pasture height; moderate grazing, with 0.20-m pasture height; and no grazing. During the soybean cycle, in the 2011/2012 crop season, rainfall was 40\% of the climatological normal. The soil moisture was within the limits of available water both under moderate grazing and no grazing, at 0.00-0.50-m soil depth, but, under intensive grazing, it was below the permanent wilting point, especially up to the grazing height of 0.20 m. Intensive grazing affected negatively the plant physiology parameters, reaching peaks of -2.5 MPa and + 6 degrees C for leaf water potential and leaf-air temperature difference, respectively. Moderate grazing or the absence of grazing, during the winter season, results in similar physiological responses, contributing to soybean plant homeostasis.},

In this study, the spatio-temporal evolution of root zone soil moisture of the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW) in Arizona was investigated during the Soil Moisture Experiment 2004 (SMEX04). Root zone soil moisture was estimated via assimilation of aircraft-based remotely sensed surface soil moisture into a distributed Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) model. An ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) based on a Kalman filtering scheme was used for assimilating the aircraft-based soil moisture observations at a spatial resolution of 800 m x 800 m. The SWAP model inputs were derived from the SSURGO soil database, LAI (Leaf Area Index) data from SMEX04 database, and data from meteorological stations/rain gauges at the WGEW. Model predictions are presented in terms of temporal evolution of soil moisture probability density function at various depths across the WGEW. The assimilation of the remotely sensed surface soil moisture observations had limited influence on the profile soil moisture. More specifically, root zone soil moisture depended mostly on the soil type. Modeled soil moisture profile estimates were compared to field measurements made periodically during the experiment at the ground based soil moisture stations in the watershed. Comparisons showed that the ground-based soil moisture observations at various depths were within +/-1 standard deviation of the modeled profile soil moisture. Density plots of root zone soil moisture at various depths in the WGEW exhibited multi-modal variations due to the uneven distribution of precipitation and the heterogeneity of soil types and soil layers across the watershed.

It is also possible to determine calibration constants, for example to account for an off-set between the data sources. So far, the temporal autocorrelation structure of the errors has not been studied, although it is known that it has detrimental effects on the results of the collocation technique, in particular when calibration constants are also determined. This paper shows how the (triple) collocation estimators can be adapted to retrieve the autocovariance functions; the statistical properties as well as the structural deficencies are described. The coupling between the autocorrelation of the error and the estimation of calibration constants is studied in detail, due to its importance for analysing temporal changes. In soil moisture applications, such time variations can be induced, for example, by seasonal changes in the vegetation cover, which affect both models and remote sensing products. The limitations of the proposed technique associated with these considerations are analysed using remote sensing and in situ soil moisture data. The variability of the inter-sensor calibration and the autocovariance are shown to be closely related to temporal patterns of the data.},

	abstract = {Solar-powered irrigation systems are becoming increasingly widespread. However, the initial setup costs of these systems are very high. To reduce these costs, both the energy usage and the prevention of losses from irrigation systems are very important. In this study, a drip irrigation control system of 1000 dwarf cherry trees was controlled using soil moisture sensors in order to prevent excessive water consumption and energy losses in a solar-powered irrigation system. The control system comprises units that are energized with solar panels, and the flow of information is implemented via radio frequency. Thus, by removing the cables that create difficulties in the cultivation of gardens, both the easy cultivation of the soil is enabled and cable costs are eliminated. The portability of the units is enabled by using solar energy; thus, units might be mounted wherever the user wishes. It has been indicated that the moisture of the application area varies depending on the data obtained regarding volumetric water content and the de fined area in need of irrigation. In this way, there are reductions in the dependence on instantaneous water demand, the amount of water to be pumped, and the energy requirements needed for irrigation. In addition, pump power and the power of the motor that drives the pump are also reduced. According to the obtained measurement values, it was calculated that hourly water demand decreased by 36\%. Thus, the numbers of solar panels, electrical machines, batteries, and units of power control that supply all the energy of the system and constitute a large part of the initial setup costs are reduced at the same rate by means of the applied technique. Thanks to the developed site-specific irrigation system, unnecessary energy consumption was avoided. Along with the elimination of excessive and unnecessary irrigation, problems with trees were also eliminated.},

In previous studies, several soil moisture indices (e.g., the soil moisture index, soil water deficit index) based on soil water availability have been developed for agricultural drought monitoring. However, when developing these indices, it was generally assumed that soil water availability to crops was equal throughout the root zone, and the effects of root distribution and crop growth stage on soil water uptake were ignored. This article aims to incorporate root distribution into a soil moisture-based index and to evaluate the performance of the improved soil moisture index for agricultural drought monitoring. The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China was used as the study area. Overall, soil moisture indices were significantly correlated with the crop moisture index (CMI), and the improved root-weighted soil moisture index (RSMI) was more closely related to the CMI than averaged soil moisture indices. The RSMI correctly identified most of the observed drought events and performed well in the detection of drought levels. Furthermore, the RSMI had a better performance than averaged soil moisture indices when compared to crop yield. In conclusion, soil moisture indices could improve agricultural drought monitoring by incorporating root distribution.},

Soil moisture monitoring networks have potential to assist in the quantification of drought conditions because soil moisture changes are mostly due to precipitation and evapotranspiration, the two dominant water balance components in most areas. In this study, the Palmer approach to calculating a drought index was combined with a soil water content-based moisture anomaly calculation. A drought lag time parameter was introduced to quantify the time between the start of a moisture anomaly and the onset of drought. The methodology was applied to four shortgrass prairie sites along a North-South transect in the U.S. Great Plains with an 18-year soil moisture record. Short time lags led to high periodicity of the resulting drought index, appropriate for assessing short-term drought conditions at the field scale (agricultural drought). Conversely, long time lags led to low periodicity of the drought index, being more indicative of long-term drought conditions at the watershed or basin scale (hydrological drought). The influence of daily, weekly, and monthly time steps on the drought index was examined and found to be marginal. The drought index calculated with a short drought lag time showed evidence of being normally distributed. A longer data record is needed to assess the statistical distribution of the drought index for longer drought lag times.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture has important implications for meteorology, climatology, hydrology, and agriculture. This has led to growing interest in development of in situ soil moisture monitoring networks. Measurement interpretation is severely limited without soil property data. In North Carolina, soil moisture has been monitored since 1999 as a routine parameter in the statewide Environment and Climate Observing Network (ECONet), but with little soils information available for ECONet sites. The objective of this paper is to provide soils data for ECONet development. The authors studied soil physical properties at 27 ECONet sites and generated a database with 13 soil physical parameters, including sand, silt, and clay contents; bulk density; total porosity; saturated hydraulic conductivity; air-dried water content; and water retention at six pressures. Soil properties were highly variable among individual ECONet sites [coefficients of variation (CVs) ranging from 12\% to 80\%]. This wide range of properties suggests very different behavior among sites with respect to soil moisture. A principal component analysis indicated parameter groupings associated primarily with soil texture, bulk density, and air-dried water content accounted for 80\% of the total variance in the dataset. These results suggested that a few specific soil properties could be measured to provide an understanding of differences in sites with respect to major soil properties. The authors also illustrate how the measured soil properties have been used to develop new soil moisture products and data screening for the North Carolina ECONet. The methods, analysis, and results presented here have applications to North Carolina and for other regions with heterogeneous soils where soil moisture monitoring is valuable.},

	abstract = {Satellite-derived surface soil moisture data sets are readily available and have been used successfully in hydrological applications. In many operational numerical weather prediction systems the initial soil moisture conditions are analyzed from the modeled background and 2 m temperature and relative humidity. This approach has proven its efficiency to improve surface latent and sensible heat fluxes and consequently the forecast on large geographical domains. However, since soil moisture is not always related to screen level variables, model errors and uncertainties in the forcing data can accumulate in root zone soil moisture. Remotely sensed surface soil moisture is directly linked to the model's uppermost soil layer and therefore is a stronger constraint for the soil moisture analysis. For this study, three data assimilation experiments with the Integrated Forecast System ( IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) have been performed for the 2-month period of June and July 2002: a control run based on the operational soil moisture analysis, an open loop run with freely evolving soil moisture, and an experimental run incorporating TMI (TRMM Microwave Imager) derived soil moisture over the southern United States. In this experimental run the satellite-derived soil moisture product is introduced through a nudging scheme using 6-hourly increments. Apart from the soil moisture analysis, the system setup reflects the operational forecast configuration including the atmospheric 4D-Var analysis. Soil moisture analyzed in the nudging experiment is the most accurate estimate when compared against in situ observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet. The corresponding forecast for 2 m temperature and relative humidity is almost as accurate as in the control experiment. Furthermore, it is shown that the soil moisture analysis influences local weather parameters including the planetary boundary layer height and cloud coverage.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture data are critical to understanding biophysical and societal impacts of climate change. However, soil moisture data availability is limited due to sparse in situ monitoring, particularly in mountain regions. Here we present methods, specifications, and initial results from the interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network (iRON), a soil, weather, and ecological monitoring system in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Initiated in 2012, the network is currently composed of nine stations, distributed in elevation from 1,890 to 3,680m, that continually collect and transmit measurements of soil moisture at three depths (5, 20, and 50cm), soil temperature (20cm), and meteorological conditions. Time-lapse cameras for phenological observations, snow depth sensors, and periodic co-located vegetation surveys complement selected stations. iRON was conceived and designed with the joint purpose of supporting bioclimatic research and resource management objectives in a snow-dominated watershed. In the short term, iRON data can be applied to assessing the impact of temperature and precipitation on seasonal soil moisture conditions and trends. As more data are collected over time, iRON will help improve understanding of climate-driven changes to soil, vegetation, and hydrologic conditions. In presenting this network and its initial data, we hope that the network's elevational gradient will contribute to bioclimatic mountain research, while active collaboration with partners in resource management may provide a model for science-practice interaction in support of long-term monitoring. Plain Language Summary As climate change drives shifts in temperature and precipitation, researchers and resource managers can benefit from improved monitoring of soil moisture. Understanding the relationship between soil moisture and other system components is crucial to improving water availability projections and understanding ecosystem responses to climate change. Despite their significance, in-ground soil-moisture measurements are often not available across multiple elevations within a single watershed. This paper presents a network in the Southern Rocky Mountains intended to help address this data gap and compliment data from other networks. The interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network consists of nine locations across an 1,800-m change in elevation. Each station measures soil moisture at three depths, soil temperature, air temperature, humidity, and precipitation. Some stations are equipped with cameras or snow depth gauges, and for eight sites vegetation surveys are conducted. The data are available through a simple data portal. The network was established with local resource manager support, and one of its guiding purposes is to support management and restoration planning efforts. Because of the network's ongoing monitoring across multiple elevations and habitats, interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network will provide researchers and resource managers with access to valuable information about changes in soil conditions in a changing climate.},

The method is tested at the Cache la Poudre catchment where detailed vegetation and soil data were collected. Additional testing is performed at the Tarrawarra and Nerrigundah catchments where limited soil data are available. Downscaled soil moisture patterns at Cache la Poudre improve when vegetation and soil data are used, and model performance is similar to an EOF method. Using interpolated soil data at Tarrawarra and Nerrigundah decreases model performance and results in worse performance than an EOF method, suggesting that soil data needs greater spatial detail and accuracy to be useful for downscaling.

The soil thermal inertia of Heihe River Basin (HRB) was retrieved based on the RTI model. Furthermore, using a thermal inertia-soil moisture model along with auxiliary data such as soil texture and bulk density, land surface soil moisture was estimated. The results were verified experimentally using the observations made at three automatic weather stations (AWS). The coefficient of the correlation between the retrieved values of soil thermal inertia and measured ones was with above R = 0.6 and the root mean square error of soil moisture was 0.072 m(3) m(-3).

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide flux to the atmosphere is the major pathway whereby carbon is lost from agricultural soils. Linear interpolation has traditionally been used to estimate soil CO2 flux in lab-based studies but the resulting curves are not representative of biological systems. The objective of this study was to examine the effectiveness of linear, natural cubic spline and constrained cubic spline interpolation models for estimating CO2 flux from contrasting soils under different management regimes. Cross-validation techniques were employed to examine the predictive accuracy, overshoot/undershoot behavior, smoothness and deviation of cumulative CO2 flux estimates of each approach. The predictive accuracy of the interpolation models differed with soil type and between amended and unamended soils. Predictive accuracy also decreased with increased interval length though being sensitive to the nature of the region being estimated. Linear interpolation accurately predicted most measured data points and had a low spread of potential cumulative CO2 flux values (between 154\% and -54\%) but produced non-smooth curves. Natural cubic spline interpolation produced relatively smooth curves but had low predictive accuracy and high variability in potential cumulative CO2 flux values (between 528\% and -617\%). Constrained cubic spline interpolation produced the smoothest curves while its predictive accuracy and spread of potential cumulative CO2 flux (between 175\% and -53\%) was comparable to that of linear interpolation. These results demonstrate that the constrained cubic spline interpolation technique offers improvements over linear interpolation for estimating soil CO2 flux. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {The soil organic carbon (SOC) plays a vital role in plant growth and development, and therefore is considered as one of the most important indicators of soil quality. This study was carried out in the central region of Saudi Arabia to explore the potential of spectroscopy in determining the SOC concentration in low-fertility soils. Spectral reflectance data were collected, under the controlled laboratory conditions on 39 air-dried 2.0 mm sieved soil samples, using a handheld spectroradiometer of a wavelength range between 350 nm and 2500 nm in the direct contact probe mode. The concentration of the SOC was determined using the Walkley and Black (W\&B) and the UV-VIS spectrophotometric methods. The increase in the concentration of SOC was associated with a decrease in the corresponding spectral reflectance. Regression analysis showed linear relationships with high significant correlation between the spectral reflectance and the SOC measured by both the UV-VIS (Model-1: R-2 =0.46, p=0.00015 and RMSE=6.6 g/kg) and the W\&B (Model-2: R-2 =0.48, p=8.92E-05 and RMSE= 2.8 g/kg) methods. For these models, two wavebands with wavelengths of 2167 nm (Model-1) and 1359 nm (Model-2) were identified as the most sensitive bands to the SOC concentration. The cross-validation confirmed the validity of Model-1 with R-2, p and RMSE values of 0.50, 0.0099 and 6.6 g/kg, respectively. The validation results of the Model-2 showed values of R-2, p and RMSE of 0.72, 0.00023 and 4.0 g/kg, respectively. Results of this study revealed the possibility and the potential of using the spectral reflectance technique in predicting the concentration of SOC.},

The experiment consisting of five planting method treatments viz., conventional furrow planting at 90 cm apart (T-1), deep furrow (20 cm) planting at 90 cm apart covering setts with 2.5 cm of soil layer (T-2), paired row furrow planting at 120:60:120 cm (T-3), paired row deep furrow (20 cm) planting at 120:60:120 cm covering setts with 2.5 cm of soil layer (T-4) and modified trench planting at 120 cm apart placing setts across the furrow and covering them with 2.5 cm of soil layer (T-5) was laid out in randomized block design with five replications. Experimental results revealed that cane yield obtained under modified trench method of planting was 18.72, 23.87, 21.22, and 27.01 \% higher than that of T-4, T-3, T-2, and T-1 treatments, respectively. Significantly highest uptake of N, P, and K (168.60, 87.31, and 254.46 kg/ha, respectively) was noticed under modified trench method of planting. The soil fertility status of soil observed initially and after the harvest of sugarcane crop clearly indicated positive effect of modified trench method of planting on soil fertility status. Thus, a favourable soil fertility helped better uptake of nutrients and cane growth, which ultimately resulted in higher cane yield under modified trench method of sugarcane planting.},

The volumetric soil moisture of soil cylinders was measured with SWR sensor and TDR sensor, meanwhile, the real soil moisture of soil cylinders was determined by gravimetric method. The experiments used loam and sandy soil. An analysis of the data gathered in the experiment shows that SWR sensor and TDR sensor both have a high measurement precision compared with gravimetric results, but soil type influence of SWR sensor in sandy soil is a little higher than TDR sensor. As a relatively simple and low-cost sensor, the precision of SWR sensor is high enough to satisfy the requirement of practical application.},

This work seeks to establish whether a limited-area NWP model might benefit from the assimilation of remotely sensed soil moisture data. The question is important because it is well known that even small errors in the initial conditions could amplify in the future states and lead to erroneous predictions. On the other hand, remotely sensed soil moisture observations are attractive because they offer a synoptic point of view and their reliability with respect to in-situ measurements is demonstrated. The authors used a simple nudging scheme in order to assimilate remotely sensed soil moisture data into a limited-area NWP model. This assimilation method is computationally cheap and simple to implement. Its impact on numerical outputs is evaluated with respect to a control simulation performed without assimilation. Results obtained in both simulations are validated with in-situ soil moisture measurements and with 2-meter temperature observations. Results demonstrate the benefits of the assimilation especially in those remote areas where the coverage of observational instruments is poor and where the irregularity of observations implies interpolation errors when reporting data on a regular grid. As found in bibliography, in well monitored areas the impact of the assimilation is almost neutral.},

	abstract = {Climate measurements are needed at a scale at which organisms live and die. Currently available climate sensors, however, are not well suited for long-term field measurements at such a scale. We have therefore developed a new temperature and moisture logger, the Temperature-Moisture-Sensor (TMS), which we designed for a wide range of ecological applications. The device mimics a small herbaceous plant. Its belowground part houses a patented, proprietary soil moisture sensor working on the time-domain transmission principle. Air, surface and soil temperatures are measured simultaneously by three independent sensors. The TMS data logger has a large memory and long battery life, so it is suitable for taking long-term microclimate measurements in the field. With a data acquisition interval of 15 min, it has sufficient memory to last for almost 15 years. We have thoroughly tested the TMS logger both in the laboratory and in demanding field conditions ranging from tropical rain forests of Africa to high-elevation cold deserts of the Himalayas. The device has provided microclimate measurements in a wide range of environmental conditions and has also performed well in controlled laboratory settings. The key added value of the TMS logger is that it concurrently measures soil moisture as well as soil, surface and air temperature at a biologically relevant scale. It is also able to continuously measure the microclimate for several years even in the most extreme conditions. The device can therefore be used to build extensive tailored field measurement networks providing crucial data about microclimate conditions shaping biological processes in the face of climate change.},

	abstract = {Estimation of groundwater recharge is extremely important for proper management of groundwater systems. Many different approaches exist for estimating recharge. The main purpose of this paper is to apply a water balance concept with two methods to estimate the groundwater recharge in the Ching-Shui watershed, Taiwan. First, a soil moisture budget method is established to estimate the infiltration, runoff, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge in the watershed, where the moisture content of the soil is tracked through time. Both soil-water properties of the unsaturated zone and climatic conditions must be fully considered. Second the base-flow model uses the base-flow separation from the total streamflow discharge to obtain a measure of groundwater recharge so that groundwater evapotranspiration is negligible. In contrast to the soil moisture budget method, base-flow estimation does not require complex hydrogeologic modeling and detailed knowledge of soil characteristics. In a previous study, we suggested that high base-flow is caused by rainstorm events. Using model analysis, depths of recharge estimated by stable-base-flow analysis are adopted to obtain more reasonable groundwater recharge values. The results indicate that assessment of the average annual recharge obtained with a soil moisture budget and the base-flow are very close; the ratio of the two methods is about 95.3\%.},

It comprises of a mobile platform, a modified commercial soil moisture sensor (Diviner 2000), a network of subsurface polyvinylchloride (PVC) access pipes, driving hardware and image processing software. The software allows the composition of two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) images with high accuracy and at a large scale. The 3D soil moisture images are created by using 2D slices for better illustration of the soil moisture variability. Three case studies of varying soil moisture content using an experimental soil tank were examined. In the first case study, the irrigation water was applied uniformly on the entire tank surface. In second and third case studies, the irrigation water was applied uniformly only on the surface of the intermediate and last part of the soil tank respectively. The processed images give a detailed description of the soil moisture distribution of a layer at 15 cm depth under the soil surface in the tank. In all case studies that have been investigated, the distribution of soil moisture was characterized by a significant variability (difference between poorly and well-drained regions) of the soil tank. A very poorly-drained region was located in the middle of the soil tank, while well-drained soil areas were located southwest and northeast. The knowledge of the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture is a valuable tool for proper management of crop irrigation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.837) and RMSE (131 kPa) showed a good agreement between the characteristic curves from the two methods.

The objective was to investigate whether including the SM parameter into SBNRC could help to increase the accuracy of YP prediction and improve N rate recommendations. Two experimental sites (Lahoma and Perkins) in Oklahoma were established in 2006/07 and 2007/08. Wheat spectral reflectance was measured using a GreenSeeker (TM) 505 hand-held optical sensor (N-Tech Industries, Ukiah, CA). Soil-water content measured with matric potential 229-L sensors (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT) was used to determine volumetric water content and fractional water index. The relationships between NDVI, INSEY and SM indices at planting and sensing at 5, 25, 60 and 75-cm depths versus grain yield (GY) were evaluated. Wheat GY, NDVI at Feekes 5 and soil WC at planting and as sensed at three depths were also analyzed for eight consecutive growing seasons (1999-2006) for Lahoma. Incorporation of SM into NDVI and INSEY calculations resulted in equally good prediction of wheat GY for all site-years. This indicates that NDVI alone was able to account for the lack of SM information and thus lower crop YP. Soil moisture data, especially at the time of sensing at the 5-cm depth could assist in refining winter wheat YP prediction.},

In the wetting process, soil water infiltrated in the liquid phase, while the soil water was in the vapor phase during the drying process. As the first step of the drying process, the surface ground at both depths rapidly and thoroughly dried by evaporation due to the daytime soil temperature increase. As the second step, the soil water evaporated predominantly from the shallower depth. However, because of the supply of water vapor from deeper soil, saturated conditions continued at 0.01 m depth. As the third step, the surface ground gradually dried, repeated diurnal variations in humidity of soil air resulted from the decreased supply of water vapor from deeper soil. Once soil water was supplied in the soil at the gobi site, soil water and water vapor of soil air at 0.05 m depth were not easy to remove.},

Its performance under realistic irrigation regimes requires evaluation with new methodologies that integrate larger soil volumes, because soil water content is highly variable in time, space and scale. We compare direct measurements in a sloping field environment under drip irrigation with simulation using HYDRUS-2D. An advanced mobile sensor technology is used to track the dynamics of soil water content, and thus of unsaturated flow, at 0.25 m and 0.50 m depth in a field plot (6 m x 3 m; 4 degrees slope) beneath two parallel (0.5 m separation; 7 emitters per delivery tube) dripper arrays. We document an asynchronous sequence of wetting fronts driven by the sloping surface and capture the field results well using HYDRUS-2D, in the spatial (R-2 = 0.935-0.963, p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 0.024-0.027 cm(3) cm (3)) and time (R-2 = 0.804-0.983, p {\textless} 0.01, RMSE = 0.9-1.8 h) domains. In general, the HYDRUS-2D simulation system has potentially excellent capability for characterizing temporal moisture redistribution, tracking wetting front dynamics and predicting the time required for volumetric soil water content (VSWC) to reach field capacity under drip irrigation. Moreover, our study showed that the mobile dielectric sensor is a powerful tool to monitor infiltration of drip array irrigation both in spatial and time domains. (C) 2018 IAgrE.

The goal of this project was to determine whether hyperspectral remote sensing techniques could be used to determine soil moisture conditions in the Dry Valleys. We measured the spectral reflectance factors of wetted soil samples from the Dry Valleys under natural light conditions and related diagnostic spectral features to surface layer soil moisture content. Diagnostic water absorption features in the spectra at 1.4 mu m and 1.9 mu m were present in all samples, including samples doped with high concentrations of chloride salts. The depth of the 1.4 mu m absorption is shown to increase linearly with increasing gravimetric water content. These results suggest that airborne hyperspectral imaging of the Dry Valleys could generate soil moisture maps of this environment over large spatial areas using non-invasive remote-sensing techniques.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed soil moisture studies have mainly focused on retrievals using active and passive microwave (MW) sensors, which provide measurements that are directly related to soil moisture (SM). MW sensors have obvious advantages such as the ability to retrieve through nonprecipitating cloud cover which provides shorter repeat cycles. However, MW sensors offer coarse spatial resolution and suffer from reduced retrieval skill over moderate to dense vegetation. A unique avenue for filling these information gaps is to exploit the retrieval of SM from thermal infrared (TIR) observations, which can provide SM information under vegetation cover and at significantly higher resolutions than MW. Previously, an intercomparison of TIR-based and MW-based SM has not been investigated in the literature. Here a series of analyses are proposed to study relationships between SM products during a multiyear period (2003-2008) from a passive MW retrieval (AMSR-E), a TIR based model (ALEXI), and a land surface model (Noah) over the continental United States. The three analyses used in this study include (1) a spatial anomaly correlation analysis, (2) a temporal correlation analysis, and (3) a triple collocation error estimation technique. In general, the intercomparison shows that the TIR and MW methods provide complementary information about the current SM state. TIR can provide SM information over moderate to dense vegetation, a large information gap in current MW methods, while serving as an additional independent source of SM information over low to moderate vegetation. The complementary nature of SM information from MW and TIR sensors implies a potential for integration within an advanced SM data assimilation system.},

However, research efforts on mine detection have generally emphasized sensor development, while less effort has been made to evaluate the effects of the environmental conditions in which the mines are placed. If the processes governing moisture and temperature distribution near the ground surface can be captured, sensor development and deployment can be more realistically tailored to particular operational scenarios and technologies. The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of the soil environment on landmine detection by studying the influence of the thermal boundary conditions at the land-atmosphere interface and the buried objects themselves on the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture around shallow-buried objects. Two separate large tank experiments were performed with buried objects with different thermal properties. Experimental results were compared to results from a fully coupled heat and mass transfer numerical model. Comparison of experimental and numerical results suggests that the vapor enhancement factor used to adjust the vapor diffusive flux described based on Fick's law is not necessary under dry soil conditions. Data and simulations from this study show that the thermal signature of a buried object depends on the complex interaction among a soil's water content and its thermal and hydraulic properties. Simulated thermal and saturation contrasts were generally very different for a buried landmine than for other buried objects.},

In this context, the aims of this work were: (i) to verify the relationship between moisture in the soil profile (until 100-cm depth) and the vigor of the plant, as measured by Vegetation Index EVI-2, (ii) to identify which is the plant vigor response time delay for soil moisture at different depths of the profile, (iii) to propose linear equations for estimating soil moisture by EVI-2, and (iv) to test the hypothesis that is possible to identify, with the aid of the EVI-2, which soil depth can be considered the effective depth of water absorption by plants. Data were collected in a coffee crop area at Sao Roque de Minas, Upper Sao Francisco River basin, Minas Gerais state, Brazil. The soil moisture was measured with a multi-sensor capacitance (MCP) probe, from March to December, 2010, and the coffee plant vigor was evaluated by Vegetation Index EVI-2. It was verified a correlation between vegetative vigor of coffee plants and soil moisture in the root zone. Linear equations were generated to estimate soil moisture in this zone using vegetation indexes at soil management scale (soil profile explored by the crop). There is a response time delay of coffee vigor to soil moisture, and this time varies according to depth and water content in the soil profile. The highest correlation was obtained at a depth of 60 cm, indicating that this depth is the one that best reflects the plant's water status. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This study was conducted to investigate the water use characteristics of trees in drylands through monitoring of qst using newly developed capacitance sensors (GS3). The plants used for data collection were Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (mesquite, invasive) in Sudan and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (tamarisk, invasive) and Prosopis pubescens Benth.(screwbean mesquite, native) in the United States. The GS3 probes were installed into the trunks of two trees for each species. Stem-specific calibration equations and temperature calibration equations were derived through laboratory experiments and analysis of field observation data. The temperature calibration equations reduced inappropriate variations of qst caused by daily fluctuations in stem temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data of qst in arid environments. The qst of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The qst of neither species in the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that they depend on shallow saline groundwater. The qst of the tamarisk decreased monotonically throughout the monitoring period, apparently in response to feeding damage caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diohabda sp.), which had been released for biological control of tamarisk.},

Mid-infrared spectroscopy with the advantages of high detection speed, non-destructive testing, and a pretreatment-free process has been widely applied in soil nutrient analysis. In previous studies on the detection of soil compositions, diffuse reflection and attenuated total reflection are two commonly adopted ways in mid-infrared spectroscopy. In this paper, we developed a method which could simultaneously measure the infrared attenuated total reflection (ATR) and diffuse reflection infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectra of soils, in order to obtain more abundant spectral information. We analyzed and predicted the contents of organic matters, organic carbon and total nitrogen quantitatively in soils by using chemometrics. The results showed that after combining ATR spectra and DRIFT spectra, the MSC-processed PLS models allowed a higher prediction accuracy than that of using ATR or DRIFT spectra alone. The coefficients of determination of organic matters, organic carbon and total nitrogen models were 0.93, 0.952 and 0.971, respectively. By combining ATR and DRIFT spectral information, the analytical ability of infrared spectroscopy was enhanced. This study provided a new method for the rapid measurement of soil nutrients.},

	abstract = {Land surface models and satellite remote sensing are among the modern soil moisture retrieval techniques that can be used over large areas. However, the lack of `ground truth' soil moisture measurements is still an obstacle in the evaluation and validation of soil moisture retrievals. In this study, a new scheme is used to assess soil moisture retrieval from both the NOAH Land surface Model (LSM) coupled with the fifth generation Mesoscale Model MM5 and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer AMSR-E. The proposed scheme is based on the strong correlation between changes in soil storage from rainfall runoff events and changes in the retrieved soil moisture either from the MM5-NOAH LSM or the AMSR-E. The aim of this study is to compare the application of the proposed scheme between these two different approaches for soil moisture estimation. The MM5-NOAH LSM provides soil moisture estimations at three different layers with depths 0-10 cm (surface layer 1), 10-40 cm (layer 2) and 40-100 cm (layer 3). In this study, the combined soil moisture over the top two layers (first and second) and the combined soil moisture over the first three layers (first, second and third) are used to account for the entire soil column for assessing the estimated soil moisture using changes in the storage from the water balance. The results have shown that the MM5 soil moisture from the combined top two layers has the better performance than either of the individual layers when compared to the catchment water storage. The results also show that the MM5-NOAH LSM soil moisture estimates have a slightly better performance than the AMSR-E surface soil moisture measurement. This preliminary assessment shows the benefits of using hydrological data in the validation of soil moisture retrieval methods.},

The method successively estimates a relative spatial distribution of soil moisture with fine-scale auxiliary data, and normalizes this distribution at SMOS resolution with SMOS data. The main assumption relies on the relationship between the radiometric soil temperature inverted from the thermal infrared and the microwave soil moisture. Based on synthetic data generated with a land surface model, it is shown that the radiometric soil temperature can be used as a tracer of the spatial variability of the 0-5 cm soil moisture. A sensitivity analysis shows that the algorithm remains stable for big uncertainties in auxiliary data and that the uncertainty in SMOS observation seems to be the limiting factor. Finally, a simple application to the SGP97/AVHRR data illustrates the usefulness of the approach.},

Available water serves as a proxy for soil moisture conditions, where f(AW) can be converted to volumetric soil moisture through two soil texture dependents parameters-field capacity and permanent wilting point. The ability of ALEXI to provide valuable information about the partitioning of the surface energy budget, which can be largely dictated by soil moisture conditions, accommodates the retrieval of an average f(AW) over the surface to the rooting depth of the active vegetation. For this method, the fraction of actual to potential evapotranspiration (f(PET)) is computed from an ALEXI estimate of latent heat flux and potential evapotranspiration (PET). The ALEXI-estimated f(PET) can be related to f(AW) in the soil profile. Four unique f(PET) to f(AW) relationships are proposed and validated against Oklahoma Mesonet soil moisture observations within a series of composite periods during the warm seasons of 2002-04. Using the validation results, the most representative of the four relationships is chosen and shown to produce reasonable (mean absolute errors values less than 20\%) f(AW) estimates when compared to Oklahoma Mesonet observations. Quantitative comparisons between ALEXI and modeled f(AW) estimates from the Eta Data Assimilation System (EDAS) are also performed to assess the possible advantages of using ALEXI soil moisture estimates within numerical weather predication (NWP) simulations. This TIR retrieval technique is advantageous over microwave techniques because of the ability to indirectly sense f(AW)-and hence soil moisture conditions extending into the root-zone layer. Retrievals are also possible over dense vegetation cover and are available on spatial resolutions on the order of the native TIR imagery. A notable disadvantage is the inability to retrieve f(AW) conditions through cloud cover.},

Soil texture controls the vertical soil moisture gradient relative to the near surface soil moisture, as their properties control water storage and drainage characteristics.

The direct use of LST as proxy of SM outperformed other LST-derived quantities, such as surface-to-air temperature gradient and day-night temperature variations, returning significant correlation values over the whole domain. LST performed better over Southern Europe compared to the Northern part of the domain, with the best results over areas characterized by water-limited conditions and moderate stress. Additionally, the analysis of the contingency matrix shows that the LST model is skillful in capturing extreme dry SM events, and it also has a good overall capability to correctly detect the dry events in 66\% of the cases, with an average probability of false alarm of about 30\%. Overall, the use of LST anomalies seems a promising starting point for a reliable modelling of the SM dynamic with a minimum amount of information.

Given the remoteness and the huge dimension of the La Grande basin, it is imperative to develop remote sensing monitoring techniques to retrieve hydrological parameters. The main objective of this study is to find out if multi-date and multi-polarization Radar Satellite 2 (RADARSAT-2) (C-band) image analysis could detect seasonal variations of surface soil moisture conditions of the acrotelm. A change detection approach through the use of multi temporal indexes was chosen based on the assumption that the temporal variability of surface roughness and natural vegetation biomass is generally at a much longer time scale than that of surface soil moisture (-Index is based on a reference image that represents dry soil, in order to maximize the sensitivity of sigma degrees to changes in soil moisture with respect to the same location when soil is wet). The -Index approach was tested with each polarization: sigma degrees for fully polarimetric mode (HH, HV, VV) and the cross-polarization coefficient (HV/HH). Results show that the best regression adjustment with regard to surface soil moisture content in boreal wetlands was obtained with the cross-polarization coefficient. The cross-polarization multi-temporal index enables precise volumetric surface soil moisture estimation and monitoring on boreal wetlands, regardless of the influence of vegetation cover and surface roughness conditions (bias was under 1\%, standard deviation and RMSE were under 10\% for almost all estimation errors). Surface soil moisture estimation was more precise over permanently flooded areas than seasonally flooded ones (standard deviation is systematically greater for the seasonally flooded areas, at all analyzed scales), although the overall quality of the estimation is still precise. Cross-polarization ratio image analysis appears to be a useful mean to exploit radar data spatially, as we were able to relate changes in wetland eco-hydrological dynamics to variations in the intensity of the ratio.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture controls the partitioning of rainfall into runoff and infiltration and, consequently, the runoff generation. On the catchment scale its routine monitoring can be performed through remote sensing technologies. Within this framework, the purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of the Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit (AMSU), radiometer on board the NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) satellites and operating since 1998, for the assessment of soil wetness conditions by comparing soil moisture data with both those measured in situ and provided by a continuous rainfall-runoff model applied to four catchments located in the Upper Tiber River (Central Italy). In particular, in order to perform a robust analysis an extensive and long-term period (nine years) of data was investigated. In detail, the Soil Wetness Variation Index, derived from the AMSU data modified in order to take account of the difference between the soil layer investigated by the satellite sensor and that used as a benchmark, was found to be correlated both with the in-situ and modeled soil moisture variations showing correlation coefficients in the range of 0.42-0.49 and 0.33-0.48, respectively. As far as the soil moisture temporal pattern is concerned, higher correlations were obtained (0.59-0.84 for the in-situ data and 0.82-0.87 for the modeled data set) partly due to the soil moisture seasonal pattem that enhances the correlation. Overall, the root mean square error was found to be less than 0.05 m(3)/m(3) for both the comparisons, thus assessing the potential of the AMSU sensor to quantitatively retrieve soil moisture temporal patterns. Moreover. the AMSU sensor can be considered as a useful tool to provide a reliable and frequently updated global soil moisture data set, considering its higher temporal resolution now available (about 4 passes per day) thanks to the presence of the sensor aboard different satellites.

Lacandon land managers plant and care for many particular tree species during the fallow period of their multi-successional swidden system to facilitate the restoration of soil fertility. Soil samples were taken around six of tree species (Poulsenia armata, Cedrela odorata, Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Swietenia macrophylla, Lonchocarpus guatemalensis, and Heliocarpus appendiculatus) in different-aged sites to evaluate their effect on soil fertility. Soil nutrient levels increased in the later successional stages of the Lacandon agroforestry system. Available phosphorus was elevated in soils beneath P. armata, C. odorata, and L. guatemalensis trees, and decreased with distance away from the trunk. L. guatemalensis presented similar effects with total nitrogen and soil organic matter content. These results demonstrate that Lacandon Maya agroforestry management choices relate positively to soil restoration.

	abstract = {Issues of food security, environmental degradation and global climate change underscore the need for the improved understanding of sustainable agricultural systems around the globe. The Quesungual slash-and-mulch agroforestry system (QSMAS) of western Honduras offers a promising alternative to traditional slash-and-burn (SB) agriculture for the mountainous tropical dry forest zones of Central America, but the overall influence of this system on soils is not fully understood. We examined earthworm populations, soil fertility and soil organic matter (SOM) dynamics under QSMAS and SB agriculture, with secondary forest (SF) as a reference. Both QSMAS and SB consisted of treatments with and without inorganic fertilizer (N-P-K) additions, resulting in five management treatments, each present on three replicate farms. Baseline soil samples (0-15 cm) were collected prior to forest clearing and establishment of QSMAS plots in 2003 and in SB and SF plots in 2005 to determine initial soil concentrations of C and N. Soils were sampled in 2006 and 2007 for bulk soil C and N and P availability, as well as for aggregate fractionation and determination of C and N within the different aggregate size fractions. Earthworm populations were assessed in July 2007. Earthworm numbers and biomass were higher under QSMAS than under SB (13.4 vs. 0.8 g fresh biomass m(-2) : respectively). Significant interactions between cropping system and fertilization suggest that QSMAS increased the availability of added inorganic P, 3 times more under QSMAS than for SB. Comparisons with SF, indicated that both cropping systems resulted in a dramatic loss of C (average 5gC kg(-1) soil) since treatment implementation, and that this loss was mainly associated with the disruption of C rich large macroaggregates ({\textgreater}2000 mu m). After taking into account baseline soil C differences between plots, no major differences in total SOM losses Were found between QSMAS and SB management. However, earlier establishment of QSMAS plots suggests that the overall rate of C loss since treatment establishment was lower for QSMAS than for SB. Results from this study suggest that the Quesungual agroforestry system offers great potential to improve soil fertility and biological health in the region relative to traditional slash-and-burn agriculture.

	abstract = {Groundwater supplies similar to 20\% of global freshwater withdrawals, and accurate information regarding groundwater recharge rates is needed for sustainable groundwater management. Recharge rates are often limited by the rates of drainage from the soil profile, which are influenced by soil moisture conditions. Soil moisture monitoring has expanded dramatically in recent decades with the advent of large-scale networks like the Oklahoma Mesonet, which has monitored soil moisture statewide since 1996. Using those data with site-specific soil hydraulic properties and a unit-gradient assumption, we estimated daily drainage rates at 60 cm for 78 sites for up to 17 yr. Our working hypothesis was that these drainage rates are indicative of potential groundwater recharge rates. Mean annual drainage rates ranged from 6 to 266 mm yr(-1), with a statewide median of 67 mm yr(-1). These rates agreed well with prior recharge estimates for major Oklahoma aquifers. To provide a further independent check on our results, drainage was modeled using HYDRUS-1D for four focus sites across 17 yr. Soil-moisture-based drainage rates and HYDRUS-1D drainage rates agreed to within 10 mm yr-(1) at the drier two sites but had discrepancies of {\textgreater} 150 mm yr(-1) at two sites with {\textgreater} 1000 mm yr(-1) precipitation. Simulations also showed that for a semiarid site the unit-gradient assumption was likely violated at the 60-cm depth, highlighting the need for deeper soil moisture monitoring. Despite these limitations, this simple method for estimating drainage through long-term soil moisture monitoring shows unique potential to provide valuable information for hydrology and groundwater management.},

The aim of this work was to develop a methodology to evaluate spatial and temporal soil water content distribution in the case of sprinkler irrigation application efficiency considering stemflow. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) soil moisture monitoring was carried out on eight soil water sensor locations for both center pivot and traveling big gun irrigation in different phenological and tillage cases. The two case studies were chosen because they show the two opposite limits of the methodology's application. Two water distribution estimation methods were employed: raw measured soil moisture and model simulation of the infiltration process. The infiltration process was modeled by means of the two-dimensional (2D) Richard's equation. The simulations were calibrated on the data measured at eight soil water sensor locations. The stemflow and surface runoff conveyed in the interrow by hilling were obtained as additional model-fitting parameters. During center pivot irrigation, 34\% of the water delivered in the interrow was conveyed in the row. During traveling big gun irrigation, 88\% of the water delivered in the row was conveyed in the interrow. Soil water distributions calculated from measured data overestimated irrigation application efficiency by approximately 15\%. The spatial and temporal soil water content distribution obtained from simulation of the water infiltration process allowed mass balance closure in both case studies. The proposed simulation method evaluated stemflow effects on the water distribution profile, leading to accurate application efficiency calculations. (C) 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {Drought is one of the major natural hazards that bring about billions of dollars in loss to the farming community around the world each year. Drought is most often caused by a departure of precipitation from the normal amount, and agriculture is often the first sector to be affected by the onset of drought due to its dependence on water resources and soil moisture reserves during various stages of crop growth. Currently used drought indices like the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Standardized 2 Precipitation Index (SPI) have coarse spatial (7000-100,000 km(2)) and temporal resolution (monthly). Hence, the distributed hydrologic model SWAT was used to simulate soil moisture and evapotranspiration from daily weather data at a high spatial resolution (16 km(2)) using GIS. Using this simulated data the drought indices Soil Moisture Deficit Index (SMDI) and Evapotranspiration Deficit Index (ETDI) were developed based on weekly soil moisture deficit and evapotranspiration deficit, respectively. SMDI was computed at four different levels, using soil water available in the entire soil profile, then soil water available at the top 2 ft. (SMDI-2), 4 ft. (SMDI-4), and 6 ft. (SMDI-6). This was done because the potential of the crop to extract water from depths varies during different stages of the crop growth and also by crop type. ETDI and SMDI-2 had less autocorrelation lag, indicating that they could be used as good indicators of short-term drought. The developed drought indices showed high spatial variability (spatial standard deviation similar to 1.00) in the study watersheds, primarily due to high spatial variability of precipitation. The wheat and sorghum crop yields were highly correlated (r {\textgreater} 0.75) with the ETDI and SMDI's during the weeks of critical crop growth stages, indicating that the developed drought indices can be used for monitoring agricultural drought.

	abstract = {Numerous drought indices have been developed to analyze and monitor drought condition, but they are region specific and limited by various climatic conditions. In southwest China, summer drought mainly occurs from June to September, causing destructive and profound impact on agriculture, society, and ecosystems. The current study assesses the availability of meteorological drought indices in monitoring summer drought in this area at 5-day scale. The drought indices include the relative moisture index (M), the standardized precipitation index (SPI), the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI), the composite index of meteorological drought (CIspi), and the improved composite index of meteorological drought (CIwap). Long-term daily precipitation and temperature from 1970 to 2014 are used to calculate 30-day M (M (30)), SPI (SPI30), SPEI (SPEI30), 90-day SPEI (SPEI90), CIspi, and CIwap. The 5-day soil moisture observations from 2010 to 2013 are applied to assess the performance of these drought indices. Correlation analysis, overall accuracy, and kappa coefficient are utilized to investigate the relationships between soil moisture and drought indices. Correlation analysis indicates that soil moisture is well correlated with CIwap, SPEI30, M (30), SPI30, and CIspi except SPEI90. Moreover, drought classifications identified by M (30) are in agreement with that of the observed soil moisture. The results show that M (30) based on precipitation and potential evapotranspiration is an appropriate indicator for monitoring drought condition at a finer scale in the study area. According to M (30), summer drought during 1970-2014 happened in each year and showed a slightly upward tendency in recent years.},

CanCM4 is one of the two global climate models employed by the Canadian Seasonal to Interannual Prediction System (CanSIPS) providing operational multiseasonal forecasts for Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). Soil moisture forecast initialization in CanSIPS is determined by the response of the land component to forcing from data-constrained model atmospheric fields. We evaluate hindcast initial conditions for soil moisture and its atmospheric forcings against observation-based datasets. Although model values of soil moisture variability compare relatively well with a blend of two reanalysis products, there is significant disagreement in the tropics and arid regions linked to biases in precipitation, as well as in snow-covered regions, likely the result of biases in the timing of snow onset and melt. The temporal variance of initial soil moisture anomalies is typically larger in regions of considerable precipitation variability and in cold continental areas of shallow soil depth. Appreciable variance of initial conditions, combined with persistence of the initial anomalies and the model's ability to represent future climate variations, lead to potentially predictable soil moisture variance exceeding 60\% of the total variance for up to 3-4 months in the tropics and 6-7 months in the mid- to high latitudes during hemispheric winter. Potential predictability at longer leads is primarily found in the tropics and extratropical areas of ENSO-teleconnected influences. We use lagged partial correlations to show that ENSO-teleconnected precipitation in CanCM4 is a likely source of potential predictability of soil moisture up to 1-yr lead in CanSIPS hindcasts.},

Such information has practical applications ranging from water resource management to climate modeling. A recently developed partitioning technique was employed using high frequency measurements of water vapor and carbon dioxide collected by an eddy covariance flux system, which was deployed over a corn (Zea mays L.) field near Beltsville, MD for a full growing season. The partitioning technique is based on flux-variance similarity theory and has the benefit of relying on routinely collected eddy covariance measurements, with no additional instrumentation required. Results showed an increase in the T/ET ratio from similar to 5\% during the early portion of the growing season to similar to 70-80\% by the time the corn crop reached maturity. This was consistent with observed dynamics of the soil moisture profile, which indicated that water was removed from deeper soil layers as the growing season progressed. The partitioned estimates of T are shown to be useful for the appropriate calculation of canopy conductance, a key variable in land surface models. Finally, the transient impact of rainfall events were examined, in which the suppression of T and enhancement of E were observed for up to several days following rainfall. Insight gained through the partitioning of ET fluxes has the potential to significantly improve the structure and parameterization of land surface hydrological models.},

A synthetic soil moisture-data assimilation (SM-DA) experiment was thus set up to evaluate the impact of the hydrological assimilation of different GEO SAR-like SM products, characterized by diverse spatio-temporal resolutions. The experiment was also designed to understand if GEO SAR-like SM maps could provide an added value with respect to SM products retrieved from SAR images acquired from satellites flying on a quasi-polar orbit, like Sentinel-1 (POLAR SAR). Findings showed that GEO SAR systems provide a valuable contribution for hydrological applications, especially if the possibility to generate many sub-daily observations is sacrificed in favor of higher spatial resolution. In the experiment, it was found that the assimilation of two GEO SAR-like observations a day, with a spatial resolution of 100 m, maximized the performances of the hydrological predictions, for both streamflow and SM state forecasts. Such improvements of the model performances were found to be 45\% higher than the ones obtained by assimilating POLAR SAR-like SM maps.},

The Illinois soil N test (ISNT) has shown promise in some regions as a useful tool for estimating mineralizable soil N; however, the procedure needs to be modified for use in routine soil testing labs that must process hundreds of samples per day. The assay determines alkali hydrolyzable N by treating 1 g of soil with 10 mL of 2 mol L-1 NaOH in a 473-mL wide-mouth Ball jar, and heating for 5 h at 50 degrees C on a hot plate to liberate (NH4+ amino sugar)-N as gaseous NH3, which is collected in H3BO3 solution and subsequently determined by acidimetric titration. The objectives of this study were to determine if variance in measurement values could be reduced and sample throughput increased while maintaining accuracy by using an incubator to replace the hot plate as the heat source. Thirty-five soils collected from N-response trials in Virginia were used in this study. Jars were heated in an incubator at 50 degrees C for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 15 h. Soil samples were also analyzed with the unmodified method for comparison. All determinations were conducted in triplicate. Use of an incubator set to 50 degrees C reduced the total recovery of N from the samples, but increasing the diffusion period increased N recovery. The 15-h diffusion period resulted in quantitative recovery of ISNT-N with significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) improved measurement precision compared with the unmodified method (CV = 4.3 vs. 7.4, respectively). Modifying the ISNT by using an incubator instead of a hot plate increases measurement precision and allows greater sample throughput.},

Manure P increased strip-average grain yield (P {\textless}= 0.05) in eight of nine site-years but yield for FR and VR did not differ. The study of yield responses for field areas with different SIP showed that manure P always increased yield with SIP very low or low ({\textless}16 mg Bray-P-1 kg(-1)) and only in three site-years with STP optimum (16-20 mg P kg(-1)). Yield responses differed between FR and VR in very low areas of one site-year, where VR increased corn yield more than FR. The VR method reduced within-field SIP variability compared with FR with the exception of only one site-year. Although VR did not increase yield compared with FR, less manure P was applied to high-testing areas and it reduced SIP variability.},

The Illinois soil N test (ISNT) is considered to be a good estimate of MN, once soils are grouped according to soil characteristics such as the drainage type and sampling depth. To date, development and evaluation of the ISNT method has been conducted using arable soils mainly in North America where, in general, soils have lower levels of soil organic matter (SOM) compared to temperate grassland soils. We evaluated the effects of two pre-treatment soil aggregate sizes of {\textless}1mm and {\textless}2mm on the yield and recovery of MN (1) across temperate grassland soil types, and (2) across a 6-h interval diffusion period. No significant difference existed in the concentrations of ISNT-N between the two soil aggregate sizes of each soil type. For both aggregate sample sizes, the recovery of spiked amino sugar-N glucosamine from a temperate grassland soil was generally linear until hour 5, after which the quantities of recovered N diminished. Although N recovery after 6h of diffusion at 50 degrees C (+/- 1 degrees C) was less than 100\% in both aggregate size samples, the response models indicated that the standard ISNT protocol using a 5-h diffusion period is appropriate for temperate grassland soils. The incomplete recovery of N in these mineral soils suggested that the protocol could be further optimized for temperate soils with high organic matter content and additional evaluation of the temperature during diffusion within an enclosed environment may be required using N (spiked glucosamine-N) recovery studies.},

Strong soil moisture feedbacks on the daily mean and maximum temperatures identified by the CCSM-WRF model system mainly appear over the region from southern Siberia through eastern Mongolia to northeast China, the Tibetan Plateau, and most areas of central and east China, accounting for 30\%-70\% of the total variances. Meanwhile, the simulated soil moisture feedbacks on daily minimum temperature are shown to be much weaker than those on daily mean and maximum temperatures. The soil moisture-temperature feedbacks in the CCSM-WRF model system are generally well validated with those from two reanalysis products. The analysis of the physical processes shows that soil moisture feedback strength is mainly determined by the ability of soil moisture to influence the local surface heat fluxes and planetary boundary layer processes. The reasonable simulations of present soil moisture-temperature feedbacks indicate that the CCSM-WRF model system can be further applied to understand the role of soil moisture in influencing projected climate change over East Asia.},

	abstract = {Clouds often limit the ability of optical satellite sensors (such as the newly launched Gaofen-1 (GF-1) satellite in China) to observe regional soilmoisture at high spatial resolutions, especially under full-cloud-contamination condition. Thus, accurate reconstruction of regional soil moisture in this case became a great methodological challenge because of the complexity and ill-posed nature of the problem. In this paper, we present a Satellite and In situ sensor Collaborated Reconstruction (SICR) method. In this method, four reconstruction rules were proposed to rebuild four kinds of corresponding missing pixels, defined as follows: C1 pixel (including one in situ sensor in its area), C2 pixel (physically similar to C1), C3 pixel (with a regular soil moisture observation sequence), and C4 pixel (remaining). By analyzing soil moisture observation relationships between these four types of pixels with in situ measurements and within these pixels, four numerical reconstruction rules were established. Linear regression, similar pixel determination, least square method, and geostatistical interpolation algorithms were used in these four rules. At last, all blank soil moisture pixels in the target soil moisture image can be filled by the SICR method. The experiment conducted in the central south of U.S. integrated 11 in situ soil moisture sensors from the United States Department of Agriculturewith 11 GF-1 satellite soil moisture images. It was demonstrated that GF-1 soil moisture observations on October 17, 2014, were successfully reconstructed by the SICR method, based on the evaluations of visual appearance comparison, error distribution analysis, subimage comparison, average relative error, and universal image quality index. SICR also performed better than the reconstruction results only based on in situ or satellite sensor data. Moreover, the comparison with the soil moisture observation from the microwave sensor demonstrated the value of SICR in regional high-resolution soil moisture reconstruction. It was suggested that the SICR method provided an effective reconstruction method under full cloud contamination and showed great potential for collaborating satellite and in situ sensors.},

We compared the ability of near infrared (NIR; 400-2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR; 2,500-25,000 nm) spectroscopy for field-scale acquisition of soil fertility parameters. Samples were obtained in a grid pattern (25 m spacing) from the surface (0-10 cm) and sub-surface (10-30 cm) samples collected at 272 locations. Samples were analyzed for organic C and total N, texture (clay, silt, and sand), soil pH, and Mehlich I extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P. We found that chemometric analyses NIR and MIR provided good calibrations for organic carbon, total N, and soil texture. To varying degrees of precision, these regions also calibrated for pH and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K. Exchangeable P did not form useful calibrations in either spectral region. In all cases, MIR calibrations were better than those formed in the NIR region. Test of calibrations based on one-third of the samples was used to predict the remaining samples. This demonstrated the strategy of developing field-scale calibrations for the spectral regions by chemical analysis of a small sub-set of samples for the prediction of large numbers of samples. This approach can be used to accurately map the spatial distribution of soil properties within agricultural landscapes. These studies demonstrate the utility of infrared spectral approaches for generating the spatial soil properties data needed to implement precision agriculture technology.},

	abstract = {Mulching of agricultural fields and gardens with pebbles has long been practiced to conserve soil moisture in some semi-arid regions with low precipitation. Rainfall interception by the pebble mulch itself is an important part of the computation of the water balance for the pebble mulched fields and gardens. The mean equivalent diameter (MED) was used to characterize the pebble size. The maximum static rainfall retention in pebble mulch is based on the water penetrating into the pores of pebbles, the water adhering to the outside surfaces of pebbles and the water held between pebbles of the mulch. Equations describing the water penetrating into the pores of pebbles and the water adhering to the outside surface of pebbles are constructed based on the physical properties of water and the pebble characteristics. The model for the water between pebbles of the mulch is based on the basic equation to calculate the water bridge volume and the basic coordination number model. A method to calculate the maximum static rainfall retention in the pebble mulch is presented. Laboratory rain simulation experiments were performed to test the model with measured data. Paired sample t-tests showed no significant differences between the values calculated with the method and the measured data. The model is ready for testing on field mulches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The L band radar was also shown to be sensitive to near surface soil moisture. However, the spatial resolution of a typical satellite L band radiometer is of the order of tens of kilometers, which is not sufficient to serve the full range of science needs for land surface hydrology and weather modeling applications. Disaggregation schemes for deriving sub pixel estimates of soil moisture from radiometer data using higher resolution radar observations may provide the means for making available global soil moisture observations at much finer scale. This paper presents a simple approach for disaggregation of coarser resolution radiometer estimates of soil moisture using higher resolution radar backscatter and vegetation water content measurements. The algorithm has been applied to coincident PALS radiometer and Airsar datasets of 400m and 30m spatial resolutions respectively acquired during the SMEX02 campaign.

	abstract = {In recent years, different space agencies have launched satellite missions that carry passive microwave instruments on-board that can measure surface soil moisture. Three currently operational missions are the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission developed by the European Space Agency (ESA), the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) developed by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), and the Microwave Radiation Imager (MWRI) from China's National Satellite Meteorological Centre (NSMC). In this study, the quality of surface soil moisture anomalies derived from these passive microwave instruments was sequentially assessed over the mainland of the People's Republic of China. First, the impact of a recent update in the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) was assessed for MWRI observations. Then, the soil moisture measurements retrieved from the X-band observations of MWRI were compared with those of AMSR2, followed by an internal comparison of the multiple frequencies of AMSR2. Finally, SMOS retrievals from two different algorithms were also included in the comparison. For each sequential step, processing and verification chains were specifically designed to isolate the impact of algorithm (version), observation frequency or instrument characteristics. Two verification techniques are used: the statistical Triple Collocation technique is used as the primary verification tool, while the precipitation-based Rvalue technique is used to confirm key results. Our results indicate a consistently better performance throughout the entire study area after the implementation of an update of the LPRM. We also find that passive microwave observations in the AMSR2 C-band frequency (6.9 GHz) have an advantage over the AMSR2 X-band frequency (10.7 GHz) over moderate to densely vegetated regions. This finding is in line with theoretical expectations as emitted soil radiation will become masked under a dense canopy with stricter thresholds for higher passive microwave frequencies. Both AMSR2 and MWRI make X-band observations; a direct comparison between them reveals a consistently higher quality obtained by AMSR2, specifically over semi-arid climate regimes. Unfortunately, Radio Frequency Interference hampers the usefulness of soil moisture products for the SMOS L-band mission, leading to a significantly reduced revisit time over the densely populated eastern part of the country. Nevertheless, our analysis demonstrates that soil moisture products from a number of multi-frequency microwave sensors are credible alternatives for this dedicated L-band mission over the mainland of the People's Republic of China.},

Motes perform communication and processing functions and also take measurements using limited onboard battery power. For environmental monitoring deployment, sampling rates need to be assigned to motes such that useful information can be extracted over both spatial and temporal scales. The data sampling rate, which is intimately related to data transmission rate, plays an important role in the mote's battery life. Moreover, while it has been noted that mote operation continues under less than optimal power supply levels, data collected during this time undergoes attenuation from the desired measurement. That is, low battery conditions of motes could significantly affect the accuracy of sensed data. This paper investigates the above two issues to achieve extended battery life for individual wireless motes while maintaining sampling adequacy and reliability in transmitting accurate data. We first study how different sensor characteristics, such as different types of sap flow sensors, can affect motes' sampling and transmission rate. Then, we examine the effect of sensing attenuation due to low battery power on sap flow, soil moisture, and soil water potential measurements. A simple regression model was found to correct data for both the sap flow and soil water potential sensors sampled on under-powered motes. By operating under less than optimal power levels, this effectively increases motes' battery life for reliable data collection from wireless sensor networks.},

	abstract = {Irrigation control systems that irrigate container-grown plants based on crop water needs can reduce water and fertilizer use and increase the sustainability of ornamental crop production. The use of soil moisture sensors to determine when to irrigate is a viable option. We tested a commercially available irrigation controller (CS3500; Acclima, Meridian, ID), which uses time domain transmissometry (TDT) sensors to measure soil volumetric water content (theta). The objectives of this study were: 1) to test the accuracy of TDT sensors in soilless substrate; 2) to quantify the ability of the Acclima CS3500 irrigation controller to maintain stable theta readings during the production of container-grown begonia (Begonia semperflorens L.) by turning a drip irrigation system on and off as needed; and 3) to study the growth and photosynthetic physiology of begonia at six theta levels. Calibration of the TDT sensors in pots filled with substrate (but without plants) showed that the theta determined by the TDT sensors had a very close relationship (R-2 = 0.99) with the gravimetrically determined theta, but the TDT sensors underestimated theta by approximate to 0.08 m(3).m(-3). Therefore, a custom calibration of the TDT sensors for the soilless substrate was necessary to get accurate theta data. The irrigation controller was programmed to maintain six theta thresholds, ranging from 0.136 to 0.472 m(3).m(-3) (based on our own sensor calibration), and was able to maintain theta readings within 0.008 m(3).m(-3) of the threshold. Theta and Sigma probes were used to collect comparative theta and bulk electrical conductivity (EC) data, respectively. The results showed a strong correlation with TDT sensor measurements of theta (R-2 = 0.92) but a moderate relationship for bulk EC (le = 0.53). The begonias had similar dry weight at theta levels of theta.348 m(3).m(-3) and higher, whereas total evapotranspiration increased linearly with the theta threshold. The lowest theta threshold reduced leaf size, net photosynthesis (P-n), and stomatal conductance (gs). Overall, the TDT sensors can provide accurate measurements of theta in soilless substrate but need substrate-specific calibration. The Acclima CS3500 controller, using TDT sensors, was able to maintain stable theta readings throughout a production cycle. These results suggest that this irrigation controller may be suitable for production of greenhouse crops as well as in drought stress research.},

An evaluation of the airborne Delta T-s/Fr space (incorporated with air temperature) revealed that normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) saturation and disturbed pixels were hindering the appropriate construction of the space. The non-disturbed Delta T-s/Fr space, which was modified by adjusting the NDVI saturation and eliminating the disturbed pixels, was clearly correlated with the measured SM. The SM estimations of the non-disturbed Delta T-s/Fr space using the evaporative fraction (EF) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) were validated by using the SM measured at a depth of 4 cm, which was determined according to the land surface types. The validation results show that the EF approach provides superior estimates with a lower RMSE (0.023 m(3)center dot m(-3)) value and a higher correlation coefficient (0.68) than the TVDI. The application of the airborne Delta T-s/Fr space shows that the two modifications proposed in this study strengthen the link between the Delta T-s/Fr space and SM, which is important for improving the precision of the remote sensing Ts/VI space method for monitoring SM.},

With information about soil PSD, we can estimate almost all soil hydraulic properties (e.g., saturated soil moisture, field capacity, wilting point, residual soil moisture, saturated hydraulic conductivity, pore-size distribution index, and bubbling capillary pressure) based on published empirical relationships. Therefore, a regional or global soil PSD database is essential for studying water cycle regionally or globally. At the present stage, three soil geographic databases are commonly used, i.e., the Soil Survey Geographic database, the State Soil Geographic database, and the National Soil Geographic database. Those soil data are map unit based and associated with great uncertainty. Ground soil surveys are a way to reduce this uncertainty. However, ground surveys are time consuming and labor intensive. In this study, an inverse method for estimating mean and standard deviation of soil PSD from observed soil moisture is proposed and applied to Throughfall Displacement Experiment sites in Walker Branch Watershed in eastern Tennessee. This method is based on the relationship between spatial mean and standard deviation of soil moisture. The results indicate that the suggested method is feasible and has potential for retrieving soil PSD information globally from remotely sensed soil moisture data.},

By superimposing the model triangle over the observed one, pixel values from the image are determined for all points within the triangle.

The overall approaches are generally based on adjusting the precipitation rate into a water balance model in order to match observed and simulated soil moisture. In the present study, a recently proposed approach was improved and assessed over a 4-year period in West Africa. Three different satellite precipitation products (CMORPH, TRMM-3B42 and PERSIANN) were used in this study. The new algorithm was evaluated over three 0.25 x 0.25 degrees areas in Niger, Mali and Benin and precipitation estimates (before and after correction) were compared to observed ground-based precipitation measurements. An assessment was also conducted at the regional scale using 48 independent rainfall stations located in Togo, Niger and Burkina Faso. The proposed methodology showed that, after correction, the three satellite precipitation products converge to the ground-based precipitation measurements, demonstrating the robustness of the methodology. In addition, soil moisture estimates derived from the methodology were found to be in good agreement with ground-based soil moisture measurements (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.78 in Niger, R-2 {\textgreater} 0.54 in Mali and R-2 {\textgreater} 0.64 in Benin).

	abstract = {The immediate cost of shallow regolith landslides in New Zealand has been estimated to exceed US\$33M annually. Since the majority of these landslides occur during prolonged wet conditions, or intense rainstorms, moisture conditions are a critical control. The nature, dynamics, and character of soil moisture conditions, and the piezometric response to rainfall, have been recorded within an `incipient' landslide for more than 5 years. The study site, on pastoral hill country within the Lake Tutira catchment in northern Hawkes Bay, is typical of large areas of New Zealand episodically affected by extensive landsliding. Detailed continuous measurements show that both the soil moisture and piezometric response within the regolith are highly storm- and site-specific. The development of positive pore pressures is infrequent: they form only during intense rainstorms, and persist for a short time. The hydraulic response of the soil is primarily a function of storm characteristics, but this response can be modified by antecedent moisture conditions, topographic position, and heterogeneity of soil properties. Stability analysis shows that most slopes in the study area are significantly steeper than can be explained by the frictional strength of the regolith. Measured hydraulic conditions also show that positive pore-water pressures alone do not trigger slope instability. A recent slope failure followed a period of extremely high antecedent moisture conditions, and occurred when maximum soil moisture conditions, though not pore-water pressures, were recorded. Increased moisture content of the regolith reduces matric tension, and therefore effective cohesion of the soil. This cohesion is critical to maintaining stability of the regolith on these slopes.

In order to investigate the estimation accuracy of the RF method at both a spatial and a temporal scale, two independent soil moisture estimation experiments were conducted using data from 2010 to 2014: a year-to-year experiment (with a root mean square error (RMSE) ranging from 0.038 to 0.050 m(3)/m(3)) and a station-to-station experiment (with an RMSE ranging from 0.044 to 0.057 m(3)/m(3)). Then, the data requirements, importance factors, and spatial and temporal variations in estimation accuracy were discussed based on the results using the training data selected by iterated random sampling. The highly accurate estimations of both the surface and the deep soil moisture for the study area reveal the potential of RF methods when mapping soil moisture at a regional scale, especially when considering the high heterogeneity of land-cover types and topography in the study area.},

Through the intercomparison of MI results from different SM-EF pairs, the general value (for latent heat flux estimation) of superficial soil moisture observations theta(S), vertically integrated soil moisture observations theta(V), and vertically extrapolated soil moisture time series [soil wetness index (SWI) from a simple low-pass transformation of theta(S)] are examined. Results suggest that, contrary to expectations, 2-day averages of theta(S) and theta(V) have comparable mutual information with regards to EF. That is, there is no clear evidence that the information content for flux estimation is enhanced via deepening the vertical support of superficial soil moisture observations. In addition, the utility of SWI in monitoring and forecasting EF is partially dependent on the adopted parameterization of time-scale parameter T in the exponential filter. Similar results are obtained when analyses are conducted at the monthly time scale, only with larger error bars. The contrast between the results of this paper and past work focusing on utilizing soil moisture to predict vegetation condition demonstrates that the particular application should be considered when characterizing the information content of soil moisture time series measurements.},

	abstract = {A method for soil moisture and surface temperature estimation in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) using spaceborne radiometer observations was presented. Based on the physical basis that the 36.5-GHz (Ka-band) vertical brightness temperature is highly sensitive to the topsoil temperature, a new surface temperature model was developed using all ground measurements available from three networks named CAMP/Tibet, Maqu, and Naqu, established in the TP, which can significantly improve the accuracy of surface temperature derived from the land parameter retrieval model (LPRM). Then, the new surface temperature model, which was calibrated with in situ data, was integrated into the soil moisture retrieval algorithm proposed in this letter using Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) observations. The algorithm combines the vegetation optical depth and roughness into an integrated factor to avoid making unreliable assumptions and using auxiliary data to get these two parameters. Finally, the algorithm was validated by ground measurements from the dense Naqu network and was compared with NASA AMSR-E and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) official algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithm can provide much more accurate soil moisture retrievals than the other two satellite algorithms in the Naqu network region. The algorithm can be applied to the areas with spare vegetation but may not be very suitable for densely vegetated surfaces.},

	abstract = {Geophysical products generated from remotely sensed data require validation to evaluate their accuracy. Typically in situ measurements are used for validation, as is the case for satellite-derived soil moisture products. However, a large disparity in scales often exists between in situ measurements (covering meters to 10 s of meters) and satellite footprints (often hundreds of meters to several kilometers), making direct comparison difficult. Before using in situ measurements for validation, they must be “upscaled” to provide the mean soil moisture within the satellite footprint. There are a number of existing upscaling methods previously applied to soil moisture measurements, but many place strict requirements on the number and spatial distribution of soil moisture sensors difficult to achieve with permanent/semipermanent ground networks necessary for long-term validation efforts. A new method for upscaling is presented here, using Random Forests to fit a model between in situ measurements and a number of landscape parameters and variables impacting the spatial and temporal distributions of soil moisture. The method is specifically intended for validation of the NASA soil moisture active passive (SMAP) products at 36-, 9-, and 3-km scales. The method was applied to in situ data from the SoilSCAPE network in California, validated with data from the SMAPVEX12 campaign in Manitoba, Canada with additional verification from the TxSON network in Texas. For the SMAPVEX12 site, the proposed method was compared to extensive field measurements and was able to predict mean soil moisture over a large area more accurately than other upscaling approaches.},

The P extracted by paper strips was significantly correlated with P extracted by Olsen and AB-DTPA. In the first cutting, P uptake was not significantly correlated with the P extracted by the three methods. In the second and third cuttings, plant indices were significantly correlated with P extracted by paper strips, Olsen, and AB-DTPA.

Pre-trials were conducted to validate soil packing and gas analysis methods. The experimental setup was found suitable for studying the regulation of N2O emissions from soil. In some cases, increasing WFPS stimulated N2O emissions while in other cases the increase in emission was not statistically significant with increasing WFPS.

A few improved SCS-CN methods have been developed to overcome several in-built inconsistencies in the soil moisture accounting (SMA) procedure that lies behind the SCS-CN method. However, these methods still inherit the structural inconsistency in the SMA procedure. In this study, a modified SCS-CN method was proposed based on the revised SMA procedure incorporating storm duration and a physical formulation for estimating antecedent soil moisture (V0). The proposed formulation for V-0 estimation has shown a high degree of applicability in simulating the temporal pattern of soil moisture in the experimental plot. The modified method was calibrated and validated using a dataset of 189 storm-runoff events from two experimental watersheds in the Chinese Loess Plateau. The results indicated that the proposed method, which boosted the model efficiencies to 88\% in both calibration and validation cases, performed better than the original SCS-CN and the Singh et al. (2015) method, a modified SCS-CN method based on SMA. The proposed method was then applied to a third watershed using the tabulated CN value and the parameters of the minimum infiltration rate (f(c)) and coefficient (beta) derived for the first two watersheds. The root mean square error between the measured and predicted runoff values was improved from 6 mm to 1 mm. Moreover, the parameter sensitivity analysis indicated that the potential maximum retention (S) parameter is the most sensitive, followed by f(c). It can be concluded that the modified SCS-CN method, may predict surface runoff more accurately in the Chinese Loess Plateau.},

	abstract = {Soil infiltrability, or infiltration capacity, is the rate at which water penetrates into the soil at a rate directly controlled by soil factors alone. The infiltrability is of great importance in understanding and managing hydrological processes, crop water supply, irrigation, and soil erosion. The infiltration dynamics measured with the run off-on-out (ROOO) method follows the changes in infiltrability during the infiltration process under rainfall conditions. In this study, the ROOO method was used to quantitatively measure the soil infiltrability under three rainfall intensities (20, 40 and 60 mm/h) and three antecedent soil moisture contents (2.6\%, 10.4\% and 19.5\%, equivalent to 7.5\% (air-dry), 30\% and 60\% of field capacity, respectively, of a clay loam soil. The soil infiltrability determined by the ROOO method decreased with increase in initial soil water content, due to the lower hydraulic gradient at the wetting front. Surface seal formation due to raindrop impact had a significant influence on soil infiltrability and was related to the soil water content. The faster wetting rate of drier soil under higher rainfall intensities, or when using the double-ring infiltrometer for comparison, caused severe aggregate breakdown to promote surface sealing, and significant decrease in soil infiltrability. Cumulative infiltration increased rapidly at the beginning of the infiltration process and then increased approximately linearly with time as the infiltration rate approached to constant. The rate of increase in cumulative infiltration was less under higher initial soil water contents, especially in the initial rainfall stage. Moreover, lower rainfall intensity resulted in higher infiltration rates and greater cumulative infiltration. The soil infiltrability processes measured with the ROOO method were fitted better by Kostiakov, Horton and Philip infiltration models than those measured by the double-ring infiltrometer method. The ROOO method provided reliable data for the entire infiltration process without the limitations of conventional rainfall simulation during the initial phase or of the drawbacks of the double-ring infiltrometer method. The results will have introductory meanings to further studies along this line. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

In the present study, slope position (valley, low slope, flat slope, middle slope, upper slope, ridge) and aspect (north, east, south, west) were derived to investigate the relationships among cropping system, terrain, and soil nutrients at county scale. Crops were mainly planted at middle or flat slope positions. Rice and orange plants were evenly distributed across the aspects whereas vegetables were mostly planted on the northern aspect. Red pepper and maize-sweet potato plants were mainly grown on the western and southern aspects. Rice sites had higher contents of organic matter and available nitrogen (N) and lower contents of available phosphorus (P) and available potassium (K). For dryland cropping systems, vegetable sites had higher contents of organic matter, available N, and available P. Red pepper sites had higher contents of available K. Contents of organic matter and available N were generally higher at lower landscape positions. Contents of available K were higher at lower and flat slope positions. Contents of available P were higher at higher landscape positions. Contents of organic matter and available N were higher on the northern and eastern, and lower on the western aspects. Contents of available P were higher on the western and lower on the northern aspects. No significant differences were found for available K across the aspects. Classification tree algorithms indicated that relative importance of the variables on soil nutrient variation was in the order: (i) cropping system, (ii) slope position, and (iii) aspect.},

	abstract = {Riparian ecosystems have critical impacts on controlling the non-point source pollution and maintaining the health of aquatic ecosystems. In this study, a process oriented soil denitrification model was extended with algorithms from a simple nitrogen (N) cycle model and coupled to land surface remote sensing data to enhance its performance in spatial and temporal prediction of gaseous N emissions from soils in the riparian buffer zone surrounding the Guanting reservoir (China). The N emission model is based on chemical and physical relationships that govern the heat budget, soil moisture variations and nitrogen movement in soils. Besides soil water and heat processes, it includes nitrification. denitrification and ammonia (NH3) volatilization. SPOT-5 and Landsat-5 TM satellite data were used to derive spatial land surface information and the temporal variation in land cover parameters was also used to drive the model. A laboratory-scale anaerobic incubation experiment was used to estimate the soil denitrification model parameters for the different soil types. An in situ field-scale experiment was conducted to calibrate and validate the soil temperature, moisture and nitrogen sub-models. An indirect method was used to verify simulated N emissions, resulting in a coefficient of determination of R-2 = 0.83 between simulated and observed values. Then the model was applied to the whole riparian buffer zone catchment, using the spatial resolution (10 m) of the SPOT-5 image. Model sensitivity analysis showed that soil moisture was the most sensitive parameter for gaseous N emissions and soil denitrification was the main process affecting N losses to the atmosphere in the riparian area. From the aspect of land use management around the Guanting reservoir, the spatial structure and distribution of land cover and land use types in the riparian area should be adapted, to enhance faster ecological restoration of the wetland ecological system surrounding this strategically important water resource.

The SPS has developed since 1984, through the use of natural regeneration of the native species Zeyheria tuberculosa Vell. Bur., with a density of 160 trees ha(-1). The forage component of the system was Brachiaria brizantha cv. Marandu. The control treatment was a pasture adjacent to SPS with the same forage but without the influence of trees. In 2005, the litterfall of trees (leaves, fruits, and stems) was collected monthly, and the dry matter yield and nutrient content were measured. Soil profile samples were collected in February 2006. The litterfall of trees represented considerable inputs of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca2+). In the soil, organic matter (OM) and K reduced with depth. At this planting density, this tree species contributed mainly to amelioration of soil acidity, in the 0-2 cm layer and/or in the profile as a whole. In contrast, there were no significant differences in N, P, and K content of the control and SPS soil. This can be related to the high C/N and lignin/N ratios of the litter inputs. Agroforestry systems are complex and the site specific interactions among the components (tree, forage, and animal) must be understood to develop locally adapted systems and optimize productive efficiency. Consequently simple prescriptions for the implementation of SPS by land managers are unlikely.},

One of the major constraints to properly assessing current status, trends and processes of soil degradation is the high level of costs involved when using conventional soil analytical methods. Previous studies have demonstrated that visible-near-infrared (Vis-NIR) reflectance spectroscopy may permit rapid and cost effective analysis of tropical soils that could provide new opportunities for farmers, land managers, local authorities and researchers in assessing and managing soil quality. This study tested the potential of Vis-NIR soil spectral libraries for predicting and mapping soil properties in the eastern highlands of Madagascar. Stable calibration models were developed for several key soil properties. Cross-validated r(2) values were soil organic carbon (SOC), 0.94; total nitrogen (TN), 0.96; and cation exchange capacity (CEC), 0.80. A spectral soil fertility index (SFI) was developed based on ten commonly used agronomic indicators of soil fertility. SFI varied significantly with current and historic land use. The index was successfully calibrated to both soil reflectance measured in the laboratory (p = 0.003) and Landsat TM reflectance (p = 0.003), which permitted mapping of the index.

The correlation of the uncertainties in the simulated water fluxes (Delta WFsim) with Delta theta(obs) and Delta ETobs was derived with the proposed Uncertainty Simulator Algorithm. The results show that Delta WFsim is influenced by climate and increases when the climate is drier. The uncertainty in estimated root-zone. was found to be correlated with Delta theta(obs). The prediction of evaporation contained large uncertainties and was correlated with the actual/potential evapotranspiration ratio. The uncertainties in transpiration under dry climates were high and were correlated with Delta ETobs; however, the uncertainty under wet climates was insignificant. The uncertainties in groundwater recharge under dry climates were large but were reduced under wet climates. Furthermore, uncertainties in groundwater recharge were correlated with Delta ETobs but not with Delta theta(obs). In general, the Delta WFsim increases as (i) climate gets drier, (ii) texture gets coarser, or (iii) roots grow deeper. The uncertainty in recharge is explained by soil moisture and transpiration decoupling. Soil moisture decoupling occurs when the information provided by surface theta is no longer representative of root-zone theta. Transpiration decoupling occurs when there is substantially more water storage at depth. We propose methodology to reduce the nonuniqueness of the inverted hydraulic parameters.},

The PRI-based estimates were evaluated using synthetic observations in NC Florida for heterogeneous agricultural land covers (LC), with two growing seasons of sweet corn and one of cotton, annually. The cumulative density function showed an overall error in SM of {\textless} 0.03 cubic meter/cubic meter in the region, with a confidence interval of 95\% during the simulation period. The PRI estimates at 1 km were also compared with those from the method based upon Universal Triangle (UT). The spatially averaged root mean square error (RMSE) aggregated over the vegetative LC were 0.01 cubic meter/cubic meter and 0.15 cubic meter/cubic meter using the PRI and UT methods, respectively. The RMSE for downscaled estimates using the UT method increased to 0.28 cubic meter/cubic meter when Laplacian errors are used, while the corresponding RMSE for the PRI remains the same for both Laplacian or Gaussian errors. The Kullback-Liebler divergence (KLD) for estimates using PRI is about 50\% lower than those using the method based upon UT indicating that the probability density function (PDF) of the PRI estimate is closer to PDF of the true SM, than the UT method.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important component of natural water cycles and plays a crucial role for the healthy development of ecological environment in arid and semiarid areas. Microwave remote sensing techniques are promising to rapidly monitor regional soil moisture. However, major difficulties associated with retrieving soil moisture via microwave remote sensing are attributed to effects of surface roughness and vegetation cover. The objective of this paper is to investigate the potentials of combined roughness parameters and develop a model that mostly relies on the satellite data and requires minimum a priori information for soil moisture inversion over sparse vegetation covered areas through combing Radarsat-2 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and GF-1 data. For the purpose, the impacts of vegetation on the radar backscattering coefficient were removed by the water-cloud model (WCM) and a new roughness parameter Zs (Zs = S-3/L is defined as a combined roughness parameter) was proposed by simulating relationships between surface roughness parameters, soil moisture, and backscattering coefficients using advanced integral equation model (AIEM). On the basis, a coupling model of soil moisture inversion for blown-wind areas of the Uxin Banner in Inner Mongolia, China, was in turn developed with Radarsat-2 HH and VV polarization data, and the soil moisture content (SMC) values for sparse vegetation covered surfaces were retrieved with limited use of in situ roughness parameters. The in situ measurements and satellite data set were used to validate the reliability of the developed model. The results showed that the retrieved soil moisture levels fell below in situ soil moisture levels before the vegetation effect was removed, and the precision of retrieved soil moisture was effectively improved when the vegetation effect was corrected by the WCM, with the root-mean-square error and mean absolute error decreasing from 7.45\% and 6.24\% to 5.12\% and 3.44\%, respectively. According to the map of retrieved soil moisture levels generated for the study area, most of SMCs were below 35\% in accordance with field observations. These study results can serve as a foundation for monitoring soil moisture and water environments in arid and semiarid regions.},

	abstract = {This study was conducted to investigate the effects of soil moisture content on the absorbance spectra of sandy soils with different phosphorus (P) concentrations using ultraviolet (UV), visible (VIS), and near-infrared (NIR) absorbance spectroscopy. Sieve sizes were 125, 250, and 600 mu m for fine, medium, and coarse, respectively. The medium size of the samples was usedfor the study. Investigations were conducted at 0, 12.5, 62.5, 175, 375, 750, and 1000 mg kg(-1) P application rates. Three soil moisture contents (4\%, 8\%, and 12\%) were investigated. P concentrations of the soil samples were analyzed and reflectance of the samples was measured between 225 and 2550 nm with a 1 nm interval. Dried soil samples reflected more light than wet soil in the 225-2550 mn range. As moisture content of the soils increased, reflectance from the soil sample decreased, which indicates that water is a strong light absorber in sandy soils. Dry soil spectra were reconstructed from the wet soil spectra by removing the moisture content effect and compared with the dry spectra of the same soil sample. Absorbance and reconstructed absorbance data were prepared as calibration and validation data sets in order to measure the Performance of the spectral signal processing used for removing the moisture content effect on absorbance spectra. A partial least squares (PLS) analysis was applied to the data to predict P concentration before and after processing the spectra. The results showed that removing the moisture effect by spectral signal processing considerably improved prediction of P in soils.},

	doi = {10.1002/2017GL073642},
	abstract = {Recent advances in remote sensing and land data assimilation purport to improve the quality of antecedent soil moisture information available for operational hydrologic forecasting. We objectively validate this claim by calculating the strength of the relationship between storm-scale runoff ratio (i.e., total streamflow divided by total rainfall accumulation in depth units) and prestorm surface soil moisture estimates from a range of surface soil moisture data products. Results demonstrate that both satellite-based, L band microwave radiometry and the application of land data assimilation techniques have significantly improved the utility of surface soil moisture data sets for forecasting streamflow response to future rainfall events. Plain Language Summary Forecasting streamflow conditions is important for minimizing loss of life and property during flooding and adequately planning for low streamflow conditions accompanying drought. One way to improve these forecasts is measuring the amount of water in the soilsince soil moisture conditions determine what fraction of rainfall will run off horizontally into stream channels (versus vertically infiltrate into the soil column). Within the past 5years, there have been important advances in our ability to monitor soil moisture over large scales using both satellite-based sensors and the application of new land data assimilation techniques. This paper illustrates that these advances have significantly improved our capacity to forecast how much streamflow will be generated by future precipitation events. These results may eventually be used by operational forecasters to improve flash flood forecasting and agricultural water use management.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an approach for retrieval of soil moisture content (SMC) from different satellite sensors with a focus on mountain areas. The novelties of the paper are: the extension of an already developed method to coarse resolution data (150 m) in mountain environment with high land heterogeneity, with only VV polarization and the proper selection of input features. During the result analysis, several algorithm characteristics were clearly identified: 1) the performances showed to be strongly related to input features such as topography and vegetation indices; 2) the algorithm needs a training phase; 3) the averaging window needs to be proper selected to take into account both the speckle noise and the characteristics of the area under investigation; and 4) the algorithm, being data driven, can be considered as site dependent. The experimental analysis is carried out on images acquired over the Sudtirol/Alto Adige Province in Italy during 2010-2011 from the RADARSAT2 and Envisat ASAR in Wide Swath mode. SMC maps were compared with spatially distributed ground measurements, resulting in a root mean squared error (RMSE) value ranging from 0.045 to 0.07 m(3)/m(3). Concerning the multiscale analysis, the results indicated that RADARSAT2 maps are able to detect the spatial heterogeneity and soil moisture dynamics at local scale, while ASAR WS SMC maps are able to identify mainly the two main classes of pasture and meadows. When these estimates are compared with SMC values from meteorological stations a RMSE value of 0.10 m(3)/m(3) for both satellites indicated a reduced capability to follow the temporal dynamics.},

	abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) is a critical attribute in precision irrigation. Direct measurements are costly and relative sparse, so there is interest in methods to predict SWC at unsampled sites from sampled data. The precision of such predictions can be improved, if covariates are incorporated into the predictor. To do that, two efficient ways are: (1) linear mixed effect model (LME), in which the spatial process is obtained by splitting the total variability in a systematic term or mean effect, a spatially correlated component and a random noise, and (2) kriging with external drift (KED), a nonstationary geostatistical technique, assuming covariates to have a linear effect on target variable. Geoelectric sensors provide noninvasive information on soil. Their outputs are quite sensitive to SWC; therefore, they can be used as covariates in SWC predictor. The objective of this work was to compare LME and KED, based on geophysical sensing, to estimate shallow SWC. The surveys were conducted in a south-eastern Italy field, using GPR at two frequencies, 600 and 1,600 MHz, and EMI. Volumetric soil water contents were measured with a Time Domain Reflectometer at 96 locations. Three LMEs, using three correlation functions (spherical, exponential, and Gaussian), were used and compared with KED using a set of cross-validation criteria. The mixed models showed a quite similar behavior even if exponential model outperformed the other two. The covariates used in the mixed models and in KED predictor were different and the results of cross-validation showed a slight out-performance of KED.},

	abstract = {Information on soil moisture is important for crop and water management. This study investigated soil moisture variability in relation to rice cropping systems in the Mekong Delta (MD), Vietnam, using MODIS data acquired from January to April, 2002 to 2007. The soil moisture was estimated using the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI). This index was empirically calculated by parameterizing the relationship between the MODIS land surface temperature (LST) and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data. The rice cropping systems were classified using time-series MODIS NDVI data for 2002 and 2006. The data were processed using empirical mode decomposition (EMD), principal component analysis (PCA) and maximum likelihood classification (MLC) methods. Various spatial and non-spatial data were also collected for accuracy validation of the TVDI and classification results. Comparisons reveal good agreement between the TVDI and daily rainfall data. The areas with low soil moisture were mainly distributed in coastal areas from 2002 to 2005, but expanded into the middle of the MD in 2006 and 2007. The largest area of low soil moisture was observed in 2006. Classification of rice cropping systems reveals an overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient for 2002 of 76.3\% and 0.68, respectively while the values for 2006 were 76.9\% and 0.69, respectively. To relate soil moisture with rice cropping systems, we aggregated the composite soil moisture maps (considering dry and very dry classes only) with the rice crop maps for 2002 and 2006. The results indicate a remarkable increase in the area of double and triple irrigated rice cropping systems in areas of low soil moisture (i.e., dry and very dry conditions) during this period. This study demonstrated the merits of using MODIS data for studying soil variability in relation to rice crops which is important for crop and water management. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

To investigate the potential for retrieving these parameter from hyperspectral remote sensing, we have investigated plant spectral reflectance (400-2,500 nm, ASD FieldSpec3) for two major agricultural crops (sugar beet and spring barley) in the mid-latitudes, treated under different water and nitrogen (N) conditions in a greenhouse experiment over the growing period of 2008. Along with the spectral response, we have measured soil water content and LAI for 15 intensive measurement campaigns spread over the growing season and could demonstrate a significant response of plant reflectance characteristics to variations in water content and nutrient conditions. Linear and non-linear dimensionality analysis suggests that the full band reflectance information is well represented by the set of 28 vegetation spectral indices (SI) and most of the variance is explained by three to a maximum of eight variables. Investigation of linear dependencies between LAI and soil WC and pre-selected SI's indicate that: (1) linear regression using single SI is not sufficient to describe plant/soil variables over the range of experimental conditions, however, some improvement can be seen knowing crop species beforehand; (2) the improvement is superior when applying multiple linear regression using three explanatory SI's approach. In addition to linear investigations, we applied the non-linear CART (Classification and Regression Trees) technique, which finally did not show the potential for any improvement in the retrieval process.},

	abstract = {Besides its important role in the energy and water balance at the soil-atmosphere interface, soil moisture can be a particular important factor in mountain environments since it influences the amount of freezing and thawing in the subsurface and can affect the stability of slopes. In spite of its importance, the technical challenges and its strong spatial variability usually prevents soil moisture from being measured operationally at high and/or middle altitudes. This study describes the new Swiss soil moisture monitoring network SOMOMOUNT (soil moisture in mountainous terrain) launched in 2013. It consists of six entirely automated soil moisture stations distributed along an altitudinal gradient between the Jura Mountains and the Swiss Alps, ranging from 1205 to 3410ma.s.l. in elevation. In addition to the standard instrumentation comprising frequency domain sensor and time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors along vertical profiles, soil probes and meteorological data are available at each station. In this contribution we present a detailed description of the SOMOMOUNT instrumentation and calibration procedures. Additionally, the liquid soil moisture (LSM) data collected during the first 3 years of the project are discussed with regard to their soil type and climate dependency as well as their altitudinal distribution. The observed elevation dependency of LSM is found to be non-linear, with an increase of the mean annual values up to similar to 2000ma.s.l. followed by a decreasing trend towards higher elevations. This altitude threshold marks the change between precipitation/evaporation-controlled and frost-affected LSM regimes. The former is characterized by high LSM throughout the year and minimum values in summer, whereas the latter typically exhibits long-lasting winter minimum LSM values and high variability during the summer.},

	abstract = {Surface ground-penetrating radar (GPR) techniques have been used by a number of previous researchers to characterize soil moisture content in the vadose zone. However, limited temporal sampling and low resolution near the surface in these studies greatly impedes the quantitative analysis of vertical soil moisture distribution and its associated dynamics within the shallow subsurface. To further examine the capacity of surface GPR, we have undertaken an extensive 26 month field study using concurrent high-frequency (i.e., 900 MHz) reflection profiling and common-midpoint (CMP) soundings to quantitatively monitor soil moisture distribution and dynamics within the shallow vadose zone. This unprecedented data set allowed us to assess the concurrent use of these techniques over two contrasting annual cycles of soil conditions. Reflection profiles provided high-resolution traveltime data between four stratigraphic reflection events while cumulative results of the CMP sounding data set produced precise depth estimates for those reflecting interfaces, which were used to convert interval-traveltime data into soil moisture. The downward propagation of major infiltration episodes associated with seasonal and transient events are well resolved by the GPR data. The use of CMP soundings permitted the determination of direct ground wave velocities, which provided high-resolution information along the air-soil interface. This improved resolution enabled better characterization of short-duration wetting/drying and freezing/thawing processes, and permitted better evaluation of the nature of the coupling between shallow and deep moisture conditions. The nature of transient infiltration pulses, evapotranspiration episodes, and deep drainage patterns observed in the GPR data series were further examined by comparing them with a vertical soil moisture flow simulation based on the variably saturated model, HYDRUS-1D. Using laboratory-derived soil hydraulic property information from soil samples and a number of simplifying assumptions about the upper and lower-boundary condition, we were able to achieve very good agreement between measured and simulated soil moisture profiles without model calibration; this is a strong indication of the overall quality of the GPR-derived soil moisture estimates. The only notable difference between simulated values and GPR water content estimates occurred during extended dry soil conditions near the surface.},

It has been conceived to be inserted in the operational weather alert system of the Italian Department of Civil Protection. The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) probability criterion is applied to retrieve soil moisture by inverting a forward backscattering model, and ancillary data such as optical images and land cover maps are also used to identify areas in which the retrieval can be carried out. The well-established semiempirical water cloud model is adopted to correct for the effect of vegetation on SAR data. In anticipation of the use of the algorithm in an operational system, in which the SAR-derived high resolution soil moisture product can be assimilated within weather prediction models or hydrological ones, an uncertainty index is associated to each estimate. The algorithm has been tested on a dataset consisting of ground data gathered for seven years (2003-2010) on an agricultural test site in Northern Italy and radar data provided by the C-band ENVISAT/ASAR instrument. A comparison, performed at field scale, between estimated and in situ soil moisture data has shown that, by discarding the estimates with the largest uncertainty, the correlation coefficient can exceed 0.80 and the root mean square estimation error is less than 0.05 m(3)/m(3). Moreover, the uncertainty index has turned out to be fairly correlated to the actual estimation error.},

Emphasis is put on the use of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite data (Envisat/ASAR and Formosat-2). Time series of images were collected over the Yaqui irrigated area (Mexico) throughout one agricultural season from December 2007 to May 2008, together with measurements of soil and vegetation characteristics and agricultural practices. The comprehensive analysis of these data indicates that the sensitivity of the radar signal to vegetation is masked by the variability of soil conditions. On-going irrigated areas can be detected all over the wheat growing season. The empirical algorithm developed for the retrieval of topsoil moisture from Envisat/ASAR images takes advantage of the Formosat-2 instrument capabilities to monitor the seasonality of wheat canopies. This monitoring is performed using dense time series of images acquired by Formosat-2 to set up the SAFY vegetation model. Topsoil moisture estimates are not reliable at the timing of plant emergence and during plant senescence. Estimates are accurate from tillering to grain filling stages with an absolute error about 9\% (0.09 m(3) m(-3), 35\% in relative value). This result is attractive since topsoil moisture is estimated at a high spatial resolution (i.e. over subfields of about 5 ha) for a large range of biomass water content (from 5 and 65 t ha(-1)) independently from the viewing angle of ASAR acquisition (incidence angles IS1 to IS6).},

The long-term effect of inorganic and organic fertilization on trace metal concentrations was investigated including the impact of atmospheric deposition and myccorhiza, whereas other factors such as soil conditions, crop cultivar, etc. are not discussed in this paper. Mean values derived from 10 experimental sites were reported. Significantly declining Pb and Cd concentrations in wheat grain could be explained by lower atmospheric deposition. Mean Se contents in all samples were 0.031 mg kg(-1) grain dry weight. No samples had sufficiently high Se concentrations for human (0.05 mg Se kg(-1)) or animal demand (0.1 mg Se kg(-1)). Concentrations of Co in wheat grain were extremely low, 0.002-0.005 mg Co kg(-1) grain dry weight, and far below the minimum levels required by animals, which applied to all fertilizer treatments. A doubling of Mo concentrations in grain since 1975 resulted in Cu/Mo ratios often below one, which may cause molybdenosis in ruminants. The increase in Mo concentrations in crops correlated with the decline in sulfur deposition. Concentrations of Cu and Fe declined in NPK-fertilized wheat as compared to unfertilized or manure-treated wheat. Very low concentrations of Se and Co and low concentrations of Fe and Cu require attention to counteract risks for deficiencies. The main characteristic of the study is that there are few significant changes over time between different fertilizer treatments, but throughout there are low concentrations of most trace elements in all treatments. In general, good agreement between concentrations in wheat from the long-term fertility experiments and the national monitoring program indicate that values are representative.},

	abstract = {Despite the importance of groundwater recharge (GR), its accurate estimation still remains one of the most challenging tasks in the field of hydrology. In this study, with the help of inverse modeling, long-term (6 years) soil moisture data at 34 sites from the Automated Weather Data Network (AWDN) were used to estimate the spatial distribution of GR across Nebraska, USA, where significant spatial variability exists in soil properties and precipitation (P). To ensure the generality of this study and its potential broad applications, data from public domains and literature were used to parameterize the standard Hydrus-1D model. Although observed soil moisture differed significantly across the AWDN sites mainly due to the variations in P and soil properties, the simulations were able to capture the dynamics of observed soil moisture under different climatic and soil conditions. The inferred mean annual GR from the calibrated models varied over three orders of magnitude across the study area. To assess the uncertainties of the approach, estimates of GR and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) from the calibrated models were compared to the GR and ETa obtained from other techniques in the study area (e.g., remote sensing, tracers, and regional water balance). Comparison clearly demonstrated the feasibility of inverse modeling and large-scale ({\textgreater}10(4) km(2)) soil moisture monitoring networks for estimating GR. In addition, the model results were used to further examine the impacts of climate and soil on GR. The data showed that both P and soil properties had significant impacts on GR in the study area with coarser soils generating higher GR; however, different relationships between GR and P emerged at the AWDN sites, defined by local climatic and soil conditions. In general, positive correlations existed between annual GR and P for the sites with coarser-textured soils or under wetter climatic conditions. With the rapidly expanding soil moisture monitoring networks around the globe, this study may have important applications in aiding water resources management in different regions.

Since ecological studies and climate change models require routine information on surface soil moisture, the ability to remotely sense this variable is highly desirable. Toward this end research was conducted on developing methods for the retrieval of spatially and temporally varying patterns of soil moisture from recently burned boreal forest ecosystems of Alaska using C-band satellite radar data. To do this we focused on both individual date and temporal SAR datasets to develop techniques and algorithms which indicate how moisture varies across a recently burned boreal forest. For each of the methods developed we focused on reducing errors of SAR-derived soil moisture estimates due to confounding factors of variations in vegetative biomass and surface roughness. For the individual date soil moisture monitoring, we grouped test sites by a measurable biophysical variable, burn severity, and then developed algorithms relating moisture to SAR backscatter for each burn severity group. The algorithms developed had high coefficients of determination (0.56-0.82) and the moisture maps produced had high accuracy (3.61 rms error) based on the minimal validation conducted. For the seasonal soil moisture mapping we used principal component analysis to capture the time-variant feature of soil moisture and minimize the relatively time-invariant features that confound SAR backscatter. This resulted in good agreement between the drainage maps produced and our limited in situ observations and weather data. However, further validation, with larger sample sizes, is needed. While this study focuses on Alaska, research indicates that the techniques developed should be applicable to boreal forests worldwide.},

Developing a robust and predictive framework for rates of plant gene flow requires assessing the role of environmental sensitivity on plant reproductive traits, relative abundance, and pollen vectors. Therefore, across a soil moisture gradient, we quantified pollinator movement, life-history trait variation, and unidirectional hybridization rates from crop (Raphanus sativus) to wild (Raphanus raphanistrum) radish populations. Both radish species were grown together in relatively dry (no rain), relatively wet (double rain), or control soil moisture conditions in Ohio, USA. We measured wild and crop radish life-history, phenology and pollinator visitation patterns. To quantify hybridization rates from crop-to-wild species, we used a simply inherited morphological marker to detect F-1 hybrid progeny. Although crop-to-wild hybridization did not respond to watering treatments, the abundance of hybrid offspring was higher in fruits produced late in the period of phenological overlap, when both species had roughly equal numbers of open flowers. Therefore, the timing of fruit production and its relationship to flowering overlap may be more important to hybrid zone formation in Raphanus spp. than soil moisture or pollen vector movements.},

The soil moisture deficit (SMD) of the root zone is an indicator that can be used to determine the exact crop water requirement. Application of the recent technology of COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observation System (Cosmos) provides continuous, integrated, area-based values, with a measurement radius of up to 400m, whilst being non-invasive. In a field experiment in Italy, the Cosmos probe was used over a mixed crop area during the cropping seasons of 2014 and 2015. The results showed that soil moisture values obtained by Cosmos were comparable with those obtained for the top 0-60cm layer soil moisture measured by sensors, soil cores, profile probes and with values simulated by the SALTMED model. This indicates that the Cosmos probe's effective depth of sensing is within the top 0-60cm. Knowing that almost 80\% of the crop root system is accommodated within the top 0-60cm, the Cosmos measurement could be useful for monitoring the soil water status and SMD in the root zone in irrigated agriculture. The Cosmos system could be made operational for irrigation managers to determine when and how much to irrigate. Copyright (c) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

One promising technique is the cosmic ray neutron probe. Here we further assess the suitability of this technique for real-time monitoring across a large area by combining data from three fixed probes and roving surveys over a 12kmx12km area in eastern Nebraska. Regression analyses indicated linear relationships between the fixed probe averages and roving estimates of soil moisture for each grid cell, allowing us to derive an 8h product at spatial resolutions of 1, 3, and 12km, with root-mean-square error of 3\%, 1.8\%, and 0.9\%.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation (DA) techniques have been widely applied to assimilate satellite-based soil moisture (SM) measurements into hydrologic models to improve streamflow simulations. However, past studies have reached mixed conclusions regarding the degree of runoff improvement achieved via SM state updating. In this study, a synthetic diagnostic framework is designed to 1) decompose the random error components in a hydrologic simulation, 2) quantify the error terms that originate from SM states, and 3) assess the effectiveness of SM DA to correct these random errors. The general framework is illustrated through a case study in which surface Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data are assimilated into a large-scale land surface model in the Arkansas-Red River basin. The case study includes systematic error in the simulated streamflow that imposes a first-order limit on DA performance. In addition, about 60\% of the random runoff error originates directly from rainfall and cannot be corrected by SM DA. In particular, fast-response runoff dominates in much of the basin but is relatively unresponsive to state updating. Slow-response runoff is strongly controlled by the bottom-layer SM and therefore only modestly improved via the assimilation of surface measurements. Combined, the total runoff improvement in the synthetic analysis is small ({\textless}10\% over the basin). Improvements in the real SMAP-assimilated case are further limited due to systematic error and other factors such as inaccurate error assumptions and SMAP rescaling. Findings from the diagnostic framework suggest that SM DA alone is insufficient to substantially improve streamflow estimates in large basins.},

It is also a wonder crop where after harvesting of the main crop, the subsequent ratoon crop is generated through established root system.

Fine-tuning the green technologies, different methods/techniques of crop production, planting methods (cane node/STP technologies and planting through Cutter Planter), nutrient management strategies (intercropping, green manuring, press mud, bio-compost, bio-fertilizers, etc.), insect-pest and disease management options (cultural and physical methods, use of bio-agents, bio-pesticides, botanicals, light/pheromone or combo traps, etc.) and management of adverse climatic conditions (drought and flood) and/or crop residue recycling and trash management technologies may not only improve soil health and cane productivity but are also eco-friendly and environmentally safe. These green technological interventions are being applied in sugarcane and sugarcane-based production system in the country. Improvement in the crop productivity vis-a-vis sustaining natural resources is key components to be addressed through these technologies. Thus, reduction in cost of production, improvement in soil health, increased crop productivity and overall improvement in cane sugar productivity and farmers' income would be possible through the adoption of green technologies. The established green technologies in sugarcane production system and pre- and post-harvest management have potential to improve cane yield and sugar recovery besides enhancing farmer's income and sustainability.

	abstract = {Climate Data Records of soil moisture are fundamental for improving our understanding of long-term dynamics in the coupled water, energy, and carbon cycles over land. To respond to this need, in 2012 the European Space Agency (ESA) released the first multi-decadal, global satellite-observed soil moisture (SM) dataset as part of its Climate Change Initiative (CO) program. This product, named ESA CCI SM, combines various single-sensor active and passive microwave soil moisture products into three harmonised products: a merged ACTIVE, a merged PASSIVE, and a COMBINED active + passive microwave product. Compared to the first product release, the latest version of ESA CCI SM includes a large number of enhancements, incorporates various new satellite sensors, and extends its temporal coverage to the period 1978-2015. In this study, we first provide a comprehensive overview of the characteristics, evolution, and performance of the ESA CCI SM products. Based on original research and a review of existing literature we show that the product quality has steadily increased with each successive release and that the merged products generally outperform the single-sensor input products. Although ESA CCI SM generally agrees well with the spatial and temporal patterns estimated by land surface models and observed in-situ, we identify surface conditions (e.g., dense vegetation, organic soils) for which it still has large uncertainties. Second, capitalising on the results of {\textgreater}100 research studies that made use of the ESA CCI SM data we provide a synopsis of how it has contributed to improved process understanding in the following Earth system domains: climate variability and change, land-atmosphere interactions, global biogeochemical cycles and ecology, hydrological and land surface modelling, drought applications, and meteorology. While in some disciplines the use of ESA CCI SM is already widespread (e.g. in the evaluation of model soil moisture states) in others (e.g. in numerical weather prediction or flood forecasting) it is still in its infancy. The latter is partly related to current shortcomings of the product, e.g., the lack of near-real-time availability and data gaps in time and space. This study discloses the discrepancies between current ESA CCI SM product characteristics and the preferred characteristics of long-term satellite soil moisture products as outlined by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS), and provides important directions for future ESA CCI SM product improvements to bridge these gaps.

We estimate potential errors in soil moisture retrievals and identify the sources that could cause those errors. The OSSE system includes (i) a land surface model in the NASA Land Information System, (ii) a radiative transfer and backscatter model, (iii) a realistic orbital sampling model, and (iv) an inverse soil moisture retrieval model. We execute the OSSE over a 1000x2200 km(2) region in the central United States, including the Red and Arkansas river basins. Spatial distributions of soil moisture retrieved from the radiometer and scatterometer are close to the synthetic truth. High root mean square errors (RMSEs) of radiometer retrievals are found over the heavily vegetated regions, while large RMSEs of scatterometer retrievals are scattered over the entire domain. The temporal variations of soil moisture are realistically captured over a sparely vegetated region with correlations 0.98 and 0.63, and RMSEs 1.28\% and 8.23\% vol/vol for radiometer and scatterometer, respectively. Over the densely vegetated region, soil moisture exhibits larger temporal variation than the truth, leading to correlation 0.70 and 0.67, respectively, and RMSEs 9.49\% and 6.09\% vol/vol respectively. The domain-averaged correlations and RMSEs suggest that radiometer is more accurate than scatterometer in retrieving soil moisture. The analysis also demonstrates that the accuracy of the retrieved soil moisture is affected by vegetation coverage and spatial aggregation.},

A previous paper described how variable soil moisture profiles affect the integrated cosmic-ray neutron signal from which depth-average soil moisture is computed. Here, we investigate the effect of horizontal heterogeneity on the relationship between neutron counts and average soil moisture. Observations from a distributed sensor network at a site in southern Arizona indicate that the horizontal component of the total variance of the soil moisture field is less variably in time than the vertical component. Using results from neutron particle transport simulations we show that 1-D binary distributions of soil moisture may affect both the mean and variance of neutron counts of a cosmic-ray neutron detector placed arbitrarily in a soil moisture field, potentially giving rise to an underestimate of the footprint average soil moisture. Similar simulations that used 1-D and 2-D Gaussian soil moisture fields indicate consistent mean and variances of a randomly placed detector if the correlation length scales are short (less than approximate to 30 m) and/or the soil moisture field variance is small ({\textless}0.032 m(6) m(-6)). Taken together, these soil moisture observations and neutron transport simulations show that horizontal heterogeneity likely has a small effect on the relationship between mean neutron counts and average soil moisture for soils under natural conditions.},

These results suggest that an ensemble system, based on a high-resolution convection-permitting model, could benefit in terms of spread increase if a perturbation of the initial conditions of the soil moisture would be added to the classic perturbation of the atmosphere.

	doi = {10.1002/hyp.8363},
	abstract = {Soil moisture influences many hydrologic applications including agriculture, land management and flood prediction. Most remote-sensing methods that estimate soil moisture produce coarse resolution patterns, so methods are required to downscale such patterns to the resolutions required by these applications (e.g. 10- to 30-m grid cells). At such resolutions, topography is known to affect soil moisture patterns. Although methods have been proposed to downscale soil moisture based on topography, they usually require the availability of past high-resolution soil moisture patterns from the application region. The objective of this article is to determine whether a single topographic-based downscaling method can be used at multiple locations without relying on detailed local observations. The evaluated downscaling method is developed on the basis of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of spacetime soil moisture data at a reference catchment. The most important EOFs are then estimated from topographic attributes, and the associated expansion coefficients are estimated on the basis of the spatial-average soil moisture. To test the portability of this EOF-based method, it is developed separately using four data sets (Tarrawarra, Tarrawarra 2, Cache la Poudre and Satellite Station), and the relationships that are derived from these data sets to estimate the EOFs and expansion coefficients are compared. In addition, each of these downscaling methods is applied not only for the catchment where it was developed but also to the other three catchments. The results suggest that the EOF downscaling method performs well for the location where it is developed, but its performance degrades when applied to other catchments.

This study aimed at tackling this challenge by developing a novel flat thin mm-sized soil moisture sensor (MSMS) using gold compact discs etching. MSMSs were examined in six soil samples (sand/silt/clay mixtures), with soil moisture in each varying from zero to saturated. The capacitance and resistance readings of MSMS5 were real-time recorded, and compared with soil moisture derived from conventional measurement. Both capacitance and resistance were found to correlate linearly with soil moisture, and the regression slopes were linearly correlated with soil porosity. This unique relationship facilitates accurate calculation of soil moisture based on MSMS readings for any given soil texture, which eliminates the need for tedious calibration of MSMS5 in field applications. Four-week stability tests of MSMS showed the resistance readings did not drift throughout the test period, and the sensor surface observation indicated anti-scratching capability, demonstrating high stability for long-term continuous in situ monitoring of soil moisture.

With respect to the reported drought records and the drought monitoring benchmarks including the U.S. Drought Monitor, the Palmer Drought Severity Index and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index products, the BDI\_b was compared with the sample average blending drought index (BDI\_s) and the RMSE-weighted average blending drought indices (BDI\_w). Relative to the BDI\_s and the BDI\_w, the BDI\_b performs more consistently with the drought monitoring benchmarks. With respect to the official drought records, the developed BDI\_b shows the best performance on tracking drought development in terms of time evolution and spatial patterns of 2010-Russia, 2011-USA, 2013-New Zealand droughts and other reported agricultural drought occurrences over the 2009-2014 period.

GRACE data assimilation mostly improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS experiment, the water storage increments introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE analysis.},

	abstract = {Transforming a weather forecast into a flood hydrograph for a watershed requires a series of steps: (1) gathering and preprocessing data about the current conditions of the watershed, such as soil moisture, snow cover, etc.; (2) creating or modifying a hydrologic model; (3) running the model; and (4) assessing the results. Adequately performing all these steps in a short period of time as a major storm is approaching is in many cases extremely difficult. In this paper the authors present a method that enables performing the steps 2, 3, and 4, in advance of a flooding crisis by determining a large set of potential “scenarios” (combination of parameters), running a model for each, and storing the results. The researchers analyze a way to create the scenarios so to maximize the uniformity of their distribution on the parameters space. They present a simple technique to retrieve the stored result that best matches the current conditions. The authors illustrate this method in a test case, for which seven model parameters were selected and more than 2,000 scenarios were generated and pre-computed.

	abstract = {This paper discusses the effects of vegetation on C- (4.75 GHz) and L- (1.6 GHz) band backscattering (sigma degrees) measured throughout a growth cycle at incidence angles of 15, 35 and 55 degrees. The utilized sigma degrees data set was collected by a truck mounted scatterometer over a corn field and is supported by a comprehensive set of ground measurements, including soil moisture and vegetation biomass. Comparison of sigma degrees measurement against simulations by the Integral Equation Method (IEM) surface scattering model (Fung et al., 1992) shows that the sigma degrees measurements are dominated either by an attenuated soil return or by scattering from vegetation depending on the antenna configuration and growth stage. Further, the measured sigma degrees is found to be sensitive to soil moisture even at peak biomass and large incidence angles, which is attributed to scattering along the soil-vegetation pathway. For the simulation of C-band sigma degrees and the retrieval of soil moisture two methods have been applied, which are the semi-empirical water cloud model (Attema \& Ulaby, 1978) and a novel method. This alternative method uses the empirical relationships between the vegetation water content (W) and the ratio of the bare soil and the measured sigma degrees to correct for vegetation. It is found that this alternative method is superior in reproducing the measured sigma degrees as well as retrieving soil moisture. The highest retrieval accuracies are obtained at a 35 degrees incidence angle leading to RMSD's of 0.044 and 0.037 m(3) m(-3) for the HH and VV-polarization, respectively. In addition, the sensitivity of these soil moisture retrievals to W and surface roughness parameter uncertainties is investigated. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

In preparation for the Hydros mission, an observation system simulation experiment (OSSE) has been conducted. As a part of this OSSE, the potential for retrieving useful surface soil moisture at spatial resolutions of 9 and 3 km was explored. The approach involved optimally merging relatively accurate 36-km radiometer brightness temperature and relatively noisy 3-km radar backscatter cross section observations using a Bayesian method. Based on the Hydros OSSE data sets with low and high noises added to the simulated observations or model parameters, the Bayesian method performed better than direct inversion of either the brightness temperature or radar backscatter observations alone. The root-mean-square errors of 9-km soil moisture retrievals from the Bayesian merging method were reduced by 0.5 \%vol/vol and 1.4 \%vol/vol from the errors of direct radar inversions for the entire OSSE domain of all 34 consecutive days for the low and high noise data sets, respectively. Improvement in soil moisture estimates using the Bayesian merging method over the direct inversions of radar or radiometer data were even more significant for soil moisture retrieval at 3-km resolution. However, to address the representativeness of these results at the global and multiyear scales, further performance comparison studies are needed, particularly with actual field data.},

Here we introduce an efficient three-dimensional method based on discrete cosine transforms, which explicitly utilizes information from both time and space to predict the missing values. To analyze its performance, the method was applied to a global soil moisture product derived from satellite images. We also executed a validation by introducing synthetic gaps.

	abstract = {Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) is a new remote-sensing technique; it can be used to estimate near-surface soil moisture from signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) data. Considering the advantages of multi-satellite convergence and the time and space scale of soil moisture, based on multi-satellite fusion, non-linear sliding estimation method of soil moisture is proposed. Firstly, the direct and reflection signals of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) satellites are separated by means of a low-order polynomial fitting, and then, by establishing the sinusoidal fitting model of reflection signals, the relative delay phase of the SNR interferogram is obtained. Finally, a linear regression model is used to analyse and select the phase of the SNR interferogram, and a sliding estimation method of soil moisture using the least squares Support Vector Machine based on multi-satellites fusion is established. Based on the monitoring data provided by the Plate Boundary Observations network, the feasibility and effectiveness of using single and multiple GNSS satellites to slide estimate soil moisture are compared and analysed. Theoretical analysis and experimentation show that GNSS-IR can provide full play to the advantages of artificial intelligence and effectively integrate the performance of each satellite. The fitting process is stable, and the model needs less modelling data; the sliding method can achieve a long time estimation, and the estimation error is relatively stable. Based on the satellites which the correlation coefficient (r) between the phase of the SNR interferogram and the soil moisture is greater than 0.50, the fusion satellites model is established; the results are better than that of using single satellites; the r between estimated results and reference values of soil moisture is greater than or equal to 0.94, and the root mean square error and mean absolute error are less than 0.060 and 0.050, respectively. Therefore, the estimation of soil moisture can be treated as a non-linear event, and multi- satellite fusion estimation is feasible and effective.},

	abstract = {To develop a sampling strategy of surface soil moisture, a random combination method (RCM) was proposed and used to estimate the necessary sampling size (NSS) of soil moisture at different sampling areas. The RCM was developed based on the bootstrap sampling procedure and consideration of all possible sub-sampling combinations of available data. To examine the method, field experiments were conducted in sampling domains of 10 x 10, 20 x 20, 40 x 40, 55 x 55, 80 x 80, and 160 x 160 m(2). Comparisons of the RCM with other commonly used sampling methods, including the statistical, geostatistical, stratified sampling, and bootstrap methods, indicated that the RCM provided rational and efficient sampling strategies. Under the same accuracy, estimated NSS values using the RCM were much smaller than those by the statistical and bootstrap methods. In addition, the RCM has the advantage of requiring less input information, whereas the statistical and stratified sampling methods require independent data with the normal distribution, the stratified sampling method requires stratified allocation information, and the geostatistical method requires the semivariogram model. The RCM was applied to estimate the NSS of soil moisture at different scales (i.e. squares with sides of 10, 20, 40, 80, and 160 m). Estimated values of the NSS under confidence levels of 90\% and 95\% with relative errors of 5\% and 10\% were linearly related to the coefficients of variation calculated from the experimental data. To enhance calculation efficiency of the RCM, the procedure was simplified using a small sub-sample size, which dramatically reduced the computation time for the NSS estimation.

The normalized difference of emissivities at 19.35GHz and 10.65GHz with vertical polarization can partly eliminate the influence of roughness and the squared correlation coefficient is about 0.985. This paper uses the normalized brightness temperature for retrieving soil moisture in Tibet from TRMM/TMI data. This method avoids parametrizing the land surface temperature which is a key parameter for the computation of emissivity. We make some sensitivity analysis for the atmosphere which is the main influence factor for our method. The analysis results indicate that our method is very good for clear days but is not very good when there is rainfall. We evaluate our algorithm by using the ground truth data obtained from GAME-Tibet and the retrieval error of soil moisture is about 0.04m3m-3 relative to experimental data. The analysis indicates that the relationship obtained from the theoretical model should be revised through the local ground measurement data because the method is still influenced by roughness and vegetation. After making a regression revision, the retrieval error of soil moisture is under 0.02m3m-3. Finally, we retrieve the soil moisture in Tibet from TRMM/TMI data, and the distribution trend of retrieval results is consistent with the real world.},

The approach was evaluated over two watersheds in the Mackenzie River Basin in northwestern Canada as a contribution to the Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) study and the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS). Based on the sensitivity of the emitted microwave signal to soil roughness and vegetation parameters, a two-stage method was applied to calibrate a microwave radiative transfer model. Roughness parameters were determined using observations taken under dry conditions. Vegetation parameters were determined using observations taken under wet conditions. Obtained soil roughness and vegetation parameters were then integrated in the radiative transfer model to retrieve soil moisture. The performances of the proposed approach were evaluated against in situ observations, estimates from the NASA soil moisture product (AMSR-E), model-based soil moisture estimates from the NARR and gauge-based precipitation observations. The lowest RMSE of 0.0254 g/cm(3) was obtained between the retrieved soil moisture and in situ soil moisture. But, the RMSE between the NARR estimates and in situ soil moisture was 0.055 g/cm(3) and between the NASA AMSR-E product and in situ observation was 0.072 g/cm(3). This implies that the proposed approach led to an improvement of 55\% and 72\% in the obtained RMSE over NARR and NASA AMSR-E soil moisture, respectively. It is noteworthy that the proposed approach is expandable to larger watersheds and very appropriate for remote regions like the Mackenzie River Basin where information on roughness and vegetation are scarce.},

The observed temporal evolution of measured soil moisture is characteristic for sites with seasonal freeze/thaw cycles and consistent with the respective site-specific properties, demonstrating the general applicability of continuous monitoring of soil moisture at high elevation areas. The obtained soil moisture data were then used for the calibration and validation of two different model approaches used in permafrost research in order to characterize the lateral and vertical distribution of ice content in the ground. Calibration of the geophysically based four-phase model (4PM) with spatially distributed soil moisture data yielded satisfactory two dimensional distributions of water-, ice-, and air content. Similarly, soil moisture time series significantly improved the calibration of the one-dimensional heat and mass transfer model COUP, yielding physically consistent soil moisture and temperature data matching observations at different depths.},

The novel ATPS consists of an aluminum oxide tube with a diameter of 5 mm, an optical fiber containing a quasi-distributed FBG sensors, a “U”-shaped resistance wire, and a flange. There are four 0.9-mm diameter holes in the ATPS. Laboratory experiments were carried out to calibrate the relationship between the thermal response of ATPS and the soil moisture content. Two laboratory rainfall validation model tests were performed to validate the ATPS for capturing the soil moisture profile in highway slopes and subgrades. During the validations, the accuracy of the ATPS was quantified, and water infiltration through grassy and grassless ground surfaces were investigated. The calibrations indicate that the ATPS can detect and record real-time changes in the highway slope and subgrade moisture after rainfall, and reveal the most dangerous zones that occur at the connection between different construction materials. The average measurement accuracy of soil moisture monitoring was 0.015 m(3)/m(3). Please note that the connection is where cracks form easily and the soil hydraulic conductivity increases significantly. The test results also indicate that grassy cover (lawn) significantly prevents water infiltration during the first few minutes of rainfall (twelve minutes in this study), after which, however, the infiltration rate drops sharply. The influence of lawn on water infiltration depends on the soil structure, hydraulic conductivity, and rainfall time. In summary, due to its small size and fast detection, the ATPS is a portable probe that can be used for moisture monitoring in highway slopes and subgrades.},

The method was applied over Chile between 28 degrees S and 43 degrees S for 2010-2012. The data set was used to calibrate and evaluate a semiempirical approach for estimating SM, first by using only the data from SMOS and ERA-Interim and then also including the MODIS vegetation indicator. Results were analyzed for every land cover class using the determination coefficient (r(2)), the coefficients obtained from the regressions, and the unbiased root-mean-square difference (ubRMSD). Results showed an increase in the average r(2) for all classes when a vegetation index was used in the calibration of the approach. The increases in r(2) ranged from 3\% for the crop class, to 49\% for the closed shrubland class. The ubRMSD presented a decrease in its value of up to 1\% m(3)/m(3) for the woodlands, open shrublands, and woody shrublands classes and up to 2\% m(3)/m(3) for the closed shrubland class.

	abstract = {The “trapezoid” or “triangle” model constitutes the most popular approach to remote sensing (RS) of surface soil moisture based on coupled thermal (Le., land surface temperature) and optical RS observations. The model, hereinafter referred to as Thermal-OptiCal TRAapezoid Model (TOTRAM), is based on interpretation of the pixel distribution within the land surface temperature - vegetation index (LST-VI) space. TOTRAM suffers from two inherent limitations. It is not applicable to satellites that do not provide thermal data (e.g., Sentinel-2) and it requires parameterization for each individual observation date. To overcome these restrictions we propose a novel Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM), which is based on the linear physical relationship between soil moisture and shortwave infrared transformed reflectance (SIR) and is parameterized based on the pixel distribution within the SIR-VI space. The OPTRAM-based surface soil moisture estimates derived from Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 observations for the Walnut Gulch and Little Washita watersheds were compared with ground truth soil moisture data. Results indicate that the prediction accuracies of OPTRAM and TOTRAM are comparable, with OPTRAM only requiring observations in the optical electromagnetic frequency domain. The volumetric moisture content estimation errors of both models were below 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) with local calibration and about 0.04-0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) without calibration. We also demonstrate that OPTRAM only requires a single universal parameterization for a given location, which is a significant advancement that opens a new avenue for remote sensing of soil moisture.

	abstract = {The sustainable use of grasslands in intensive farming systems aims to optimize nitrogen (N) inputs to increase crop yields and decrease harmful losses to the environment at the same time. To achieve this, simple optical sensors may provide a non-destructive, time- and cost-effective tool for estimating plant biomass in the field, considering spatial and temporal variability. However, the plant growth and related N uptake is affected by the available N in the soil, and therefore, N mineralization and N losses. These soil N dynamics and N losses are affected by the N input and environmental conditions, and cannot easily be determined non-destructively. Therefore, the question arises: whether a relationship can be depicted between N fertilizer levels, plant biomass and N dynamics as indicated by nitrous oxide (N2O) losses and inorganic N levels. We conducted a standardized greenhouse experiment to explore the potential of spectral measurements for analyzing yield response, N mineralization and N2O emissions in a permanent grassland. Ryegrass was subjected to four mineral fertilizer input levels over 100 days (four harvests) under controlled environmental conditions. The soil temperature and moisture content were automatically monitored, and the emission rates of N2O and carbon dioxide (CO2) were detected frequently. Spectral measurements of the swards were performed directly before harvesting. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and simple ratio (SR) were moderately correlated with an increasing biomass as affected by fertilization level. Furthermore, we found a non-linear response of increasing N2O emissions to elevated fertilizer levels. Moreover, inorganic N and extractable organic N levels at the end of the experiment tended to increase with the increasing N fertilizer addition. However, microbial biomass C and CO2 efflux showed no significant differences among fertilizer treatments, reflecting no substantial changes in the soil biological pool size and the extent of the C mineralization. Neither the NDVI nor SR, nor the plant biomass, were related to cumulative N2O emissions or inorganic N at harvesting. Our results verify the usefulness of optical sensors for biomass detection, and show the difficulty in linking spectral measurements of plant traits to N processes in the soil, despite that the latter affects the former.},

	abstract = {The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation has provided high-quality SAR data with fine spatial and temporal sampling characterizations (6(similar to)12 revisit days at 10 m spatial resolution). When combined with high-resolution optical remote sensing, this data can potentially be used for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over vegetated areas. However, the suitability of different vegetation index (VI) types for the parameterization of vegetation water content in SAR vegetation scattering models requires further investigation. In this study, the widely-used physical-based Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for the retrieval of field-scale soil moisture. Three different VIs (NDVI, EVI, and LAI) produced by two different satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) are selected to examine their impact on the parameterization of vegetation water content, and subsequently, on soil moisture retrieval accuracy. Results indicate that, despite the different sensitivity of estimated surface roughness parameters to various VIs (i.e., this sensitivity is highest when utilizing MODIS EVI and lowest in the LAI-based model), the optimum roughness parameters derived from each VI exhibit no discernible difference. Consequently, the soil moisture retrieval accuracies show no noticeable sensitivity to the choice of a particular VI. Generally, meadow and grassland sites with small differences in VIderived roughness parameters exhibit good performance in soil moisture estimation. With respect to the relative components in the coupled model, the vegetative contribution to the scattering signal exceeds that of soil at VI about 0.6 similar to 0.8 [-] in NDVI-based models and 0.4 similar to 0.6 [-] in EVI-based models. This study provides insight into the proper selection of vegetation indices during the use of SAR and optical imagery for the retrieval of high-resolution surface soil moisture.},

We present simulated and experimental study in order to assess the effect of salinity on the complex permittivity of geological materials and, therefore, on the radar backscattering coefficient in the [1-7 GHz] frequency range. Laboratory measurements are performed on sand/sodium chloride aqueous mixtures using a vectorial network analyzer coupled to an open-ended coaxial dielectric probe. We aim at calibrating and validating semiempirical dielectric mixing models. In particular, we evaluated the dependence of the real and imaginary parts of complex permittivity on the microwave frequency, water content, and salinity. Our results confirm that if the real part is mainly affected by the moisture content, the imaginary part is more sensitive to salinity. In addition to the classic formulas of mixing models, the ionic-conductivity losses, which are due to mobile ions in the saline solution, are taken into account in order to better assess the effect of salinity on the dielectric properties of mixtures. Dielectric mixing models are then used as input parameters for the simulation of the radar backscattering coefficients by means of an analytical model: the integral equation model. Simulation results show that salinity should have a significant impact on the radar backscattering recorded in synthetic aperture radar data in terms of the magnitude of the backscattering coefficient. Moreover, our results suggest that VV polarization provides a greater sensitivity to salinity than HH polarization.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays a critical role in many hydrological processes including infiltration, evaporation, and runoff. Satellite-based passive microwave sensors offer an effective way to observe soil moisture conditions over vast areas. There are currently several satellite systems that can detect soil moisture. Calibration, validation, and characterization of data received from these satellite systems are an ongoing process. One approach to these requirements is to collect and compare long-term in situ (field) measurements of soil moisture with remotely sensed data. The in situ measurements for this paper were collected at the Little River Watershed (LRW) Tifton, Georgia and compared to the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission Microwave Imager (TMI) 10.65 GHz vertical and horizontial (V and H) sensors and vegetation density Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) for the period from 1999 through 2002. The in situ soil moisture probes exist in conjunction with rain gauge stations throughout the sampling region. It was found that the TMI was able to observe soil moisture conditions when vegetation levels were low. However, during several months each year high vegetation levels mask the soil moisture signal from the TMI. When the monthly averaged observation from the TMI, MODIS, and in situ probes were subjected to a multivariable comparison the correlation value increased slightly, improving the accuracy of the TMI-soil moisture correlation. Our results show that the TMI estimate would not result in an adequate monitoring of large land areas but when used in conjunction with other satellite sensors and in situ networks and model output can constitute an effective means of monitoring soil moisture of the land surface.

The study is based on extensive field surveys conducted from 2005 to 2009 in the Campidano plain of Sardinia, Italy. A total of 12 small bare soil fields were sampled for moisture, surface roughness, and texture values. From field scale analysis with ENVISAT ASAR (C-band, VV polarized, descending mode, incidence angle from 15.0 degrees to 31.4 degrees), an empirical model for estimating bare soil moisture was established, with a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.85. LANDSAT TM5 images were also used for soil moisture estimation using the TVX slope (temperature/vegetation index), and in this case the best linear relationship had an R-2 of 0.81. A cross-validation on the two empirical models demonstrated the potential of C-band SAR data for estimation of surface moisture, with and R-2 of 0.76 (bias + 03\% and RMSE 7\%) for ENVISAT ASAR and 0.54 (bias + 13\% and RMSE 5\%) for LANDSAT TM5. The two models developed at plot level were then applied over the Campidano plain and assessed via multitemporal and spatial analyses, in the latter case against soil permeability data from a pedological map of Sardinia. Encouraging estimated soil moisture (ESM) maps were obtained for the SAR-based model, whereas the LANDSAT-based model would require a better field data set for validation, including ground data collected on vegetated fields. ESM maps showed sensitivity to soil drainage qualities or drainage potential, which could be useful in irrigation management and other agricultural applications. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Sustainable nutrient cycling in agroecosystems combining grazing and crops has global ramifications for protecting these ecosystems and for the livelihoods they support. We sought to understand environmental, management, and social drivers of nutrient management and sustainability in Andean grazing/crop systems. We assessed the impact of farmer wealth, fields' proximity to villages, topography, and rangeland net primary productivity (NPP) on mass balances for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) of 43 fields. Wealthier farmers applied greater total amounts (kg) of manure nutrients. However, higher manure application rates (kg ha(-1)) were associated with field proximity and NPP rather than wealth. Manure P inputs in far fields ({\textgreater} 500-m distant) were half those in near fields. Harvest exports increased with manure inputs (P {\textless} 0.001) so that balances varied less than either of these flows. Erosion nutrient losses in steeper far fields matched crop exports, and yields declined with increasing field slope (P {\textless} 0.001), suggesting that erosion reduces productivity. Balances for P were slightly positive in near and far fields (+2.2 kg P ha(-1) y(-1), combined mean) when calculated without erosion, but zero in near fields and negative in far fields with erosion included (-6.1 kg P ha(-1) y(-1) in far fields). Near/far differences in both inputs and erosion thus drove P limitation. Crop K exports dominated K balances, which were negative even without accounting for erosion. Modeled intensification scenarios showed that remediating far field deficits would require P addition and erosion reduction. Management nested within environmental constraints (NPP, erosion) rather than socioeconomic status drives soil nutrient sustainability in these agroecosystems. Time-lags between management and long-term degradation are a principal sustainability challenge to farming in these montane grazing/crop agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {In-depth study of the soil moisture mechanisms and understanding of the soil moisture transport law has an important practical significance for regional water resources management and the challenge of the water resources scarcity. Using traditional methods of soil moisture monitoring, deep soil layers can be monitored, but continuous monitoring of soil moisture at the regional level cannot be achieved. Although remote sensing simulation models can meet regional scale needs, these models are confined to the surface soil layer, and research on deep soil moisture inversion is still lacking. This paper focuses on these two issues, and investigates a remote sensing-driven soil moisture monitoring model for the Weihe River Basin. Considering water resource management needs in the Weihe River Basin, we improved the structure of the soil moisture balance model and optimized model parameters to build the remote sensing driven soil moisture balance model (RS-SWBM). Based on soil moisture modeling, the effect of vegetation on soil moisture in the Weihe River Basin was analyzed. The RS-SWBM developed for the Weihe River Basin was validated with observational data and Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) soil moisture data products. Based on the correlation analysis, correlation coefficients were all above 0.80, reflecting the effectiveness of the model. The effects of different vegetation types on soil moisture dynamics and consumption efficiency were analyzed. The results indicated that different vegetation types experienced different seasonal variations, vertical patterns, and consumption efficiencies, with strong correlations existing between these parameters and land use as well as precipitation.},

Using EO metadata ontology, an application for soil moisture monitoring in Hubei Province in China is tested. The results indicate that metadata retrieval with a spatiotemporal-spectral-enhanced method can efficiently achieve fine-grained discovery of qualified EO metadata and obtain soil moisture monitoring information from sensor images.

The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Aqua platform (AMSR-E) has made significant contributions to this application. As the result of agency and individual initiatives, several approaches for the retrieval of soil moisture from AMSR-E have been proposed and implemented. Although the majority of these are based on the same Radiative Transfer Equation, studies have shown that the resulting soil moisture estimates can differ significantly. A primary goal of this investigation is to understand these differences and develop a suitable approach to potentially improve the algorithm currently used by NASA in producing its operational soil moisture product In order to achieve this goal, the theoretical basis of several alternative soil moisture retrieval algorithms are examined. Analysis has focused on five established approaches: the operational algorithm adopted by NASA, which is referred to as the Normalized Polarization Difference algorithm, the Single Channel Algorithm, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model, the University of Montana soil moisture algorithm, and the HydroAlgo Artificial Neural Network algorithm. Previous comparisons of these algorithms in the literature have typically focused on the retrieved soil moisture products, and employed different metrics and data sets, and have resulted in differing conclusions. In this investigation we attempt to provide a more thorough understanding of the fundamental differences between the algorithms and how these differences affect their performance in terms of range of soil moisture provided. The comparative overview presented in the paper is based on the operating versions of the source codes of the individual algorithms. Analysis has indicated that the differences between algorithms lie in the specific parameterizations and assumptions of each algorithm. The comparative overview of the theoretical basis of the approaches is linked to differences found in the soil moisture retrievals, leading to suggestions for improvements and increased reliability in these algorithms.

	abstract = {Agricultural drought can have long-lasting and harmful impacts on both the ecosystem and economy. Therefore, it is important to monitor and predict agricultural drought accurately. Soil moisture is the key variable to define the agricultural drought index. However, in situ soil moisture observations are inaccessible in many areas of the world. Remote sensing techniques enrich the surface soil moisture observations at different tempo-spatial resolutions. In this study, the Level 2 L-band radiometer soil moisture dataset was used to estimate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI). The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) dataset was evaluated with the soil moisture dataset obtained from the China Land Soil Moisture Data Assimilation System (CLSMDAS). The SMAP-derived SWDI (SMAP\_SWDI) was compared with the atmospheric water deficit (AWD) calculated with precipitation and evapotranspiration from meteorological stations. Drought monitoring and comparison were accomplished at a weekly scale for the growing season (April to November) from 2015 to 2017. The results were as follows: (1) in terms of Pearson correlation coefficients (R-value) between SMAP and CLSMDAS, around 70\% performed well and only 10\% performed poorly at the grid scale, and the R-value was 0.62 for the whole basin; (2) severe droughts mainly occurred from mid-June to the end of September from 2015 to 2017; (3) severe droughts were detected in the southern and northeastern Xiang River Basin in mid-May of 2015, and in the northern basin in early August of 2016 and end of November 2017; (4) the values of percentage of drought weeks gradually decreased from 2015 to 2017, and increased from the northeast to the southwest of the basin in 2015 and 2016; and (5) the average value of R and probability of detection between SMAP\_SWDI and AWD were 0.6 and 0.79, respectively. These results show SMAP has acceptable accuracy and good performance for drought monitoring in the Xiang River Basin.},

	abstract = {Increasing drought poses a big threat to food security over recent decades, highlighting the need for effective tools and adequate information for drought monitoring and mitigation. This study analyzed the performance of five climate-based drought indices and soil moisture measurements for monitoring winter wheat drought threat in China. We employed the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), the Palmer Drought SeverityIndex (PDSI), the Palmer Z index and the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index (scPDSI). On average, soil moisture at 50-cm depth correlated better with winter wheat yield during October-December of the previous year of harvest compared to soil moisture at 10-cm and 20-cm depths. Moreover, the 3-layer soil moisture and reference evapotranspiration (ETo) correlated weakly (Pearson's r{\textless}0.3) and even negatively with winter wheat yield. The SPI and SPEI at shorter (1-5 months) timescales during September-December in the previous year of harvest showed higher correlations with winter wheat yield. The SPEI trend in March-June has a significant positive influence on trend in winter wheat yield (r{\textgreater}0.40, p{\textless}0.05). The climate-based drought indices can facilitate crop drought monitoring in water-limited regions due to the wide-availability of climatic data, particularly in the light of uncertainties arising from the crop model. Among the investigated indices, results revealed that the SPEI is advantageous for drought monitoring over the study area due to its multiscalarity and effective characterization of agricultural droughts.

Samples were obtained from seven soil profiles along a 250 m succession from unvegetated dunes to dunes partially stabilized by C-3 or C-4 grasses to stable dunes supporting an oak-savannah ecosystem. This location provided the opportunity to determine the relative influences of topography, vegetation and seasonality on the volumetric soil-water content under temperate-humid conditions. Despite frequent and abundant precipitation, the soils were well drained at all times. Nevertheless, the sands typically retained a fraction of older soil water even following large rain events. The presence and type of vegetation had the greatest influence on soil moisture contents, both within a given profile and along the transition from unvegetated to forested dunes. Relative to unvegetated soils, grass roots facilitated more rapid infiltration of precipitation into deeper soil layers. During the growing season, however, soils in both forested and grassy areas became depleted of moisture in the rooting zone. The greater moisture retention of the organic-rich A-horizon and shading resulted in higher water contents of the uppermost soil layer in forested areas despite interception of some precipitation by the oak canopy. During warm summer months, the competing effects of increased evapotranspiration and periodic wetting accentuated differences in soil moisture content among sites.

	abstract = {The agriculture sector is a major contributor towards global N2O (nitrous oxide) emissions. Amongst various factors controlling N2O emissions from cultivated fields, application of fertilizers and manures is the key factor. The effect of 42 years of continuous application of inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on N2O emissions in loamy sand soil was studied via closed chambers and gas chromatography. Daily N2O fluxes from five treatments: 100\% NPK (T-1), 150\% NPK (T-2), 100\% N (T-3), 100\% NPK+ FYM(T-4) and Control (T-5), of an onging experiment under maize-wheat cropping system on Typic Ustochrept in Northern India, were measured during maize and wheat crop seasons. The average N2O fluxes in T-1, T-2, T-3, T-4 and T-5 treatments during maize crop season were 56.2, 60.8, 58.5, 59.2 and 24.6N(2)O-Ng ha(-1) day(-1), respectively and in thewheat crop season 17.1, 19.7, 17.2, 19.4 and 11.5 N2O-N g ha(-1) day(-1), respectively. Total N2O emissions in long-term fertilizer or manure treatments were approximately 100 and 50\% higher than control in the maize and wheat crop seasons, respectively. Various long-term treatments had significant effect on status of various soils C and N forms, which in-turn influenced N2O emissions. Regression analysis revealed that water-input either from rainfall or irrigation controlled nearly 50\% of the seasonal variations in N2O fluxes in the control treatment and about 20\% variations in fertilizer and manure treatments. This suggested that in addition to irrigation or rainfall, fertilizer application also played an important role in N2O emissions. Although carbon-equivalent emissions were higher from balanced fertilization or FYM application treatments, yield-scaled global warming potentials (GWP) were lower due to higher maize and wheat grain yields in these treatments. Long-termmaize-wheat cropping without any nutrient application or imbalanced fertilization resulted in higher yield-scaled GWP. The findings suggested that to achieve food security and curtail N2O emissions, balanced fertilization or integrated nutrient management may be adopted. (c) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Soil water is strongly affected by land use/cover in the Loess Plateau in China. Water stored in thick loessal soils is one of the most important resources regulating vegetation growth. However, soil water in the deep loess profile, which is critical for maintaining the function of the “soil water pool” is rarely studied because deep profile soil samples are difficult to collect. In this study, four experimental plots were established in 2005 to represent different farming systems on the Changwu Tableland: fallow land, fertilized cropland, unfertilized cropland, and continuous alfalfa. The soil water content in the 15-m-deep loess profiles was monitored continuously from 2007 to 2012 with the neutron probe technique. The results showed that temporal variations in soil water profiles differed among the four farming systems. Under fallow land, the soil water content increased gradually over time, first in the surface layers and later in the deep soil layers. In contrast, the soil water content decreased gradually under continuous alfalfa. The distributions of soil water in deep soil layers under both fertilized and unfertilized cropland were relatively stable overtime. Thus fanning system significantly affected soil water content. Seven years after the start of the experiment, the soil water contents in the 15-m-deep profiles averaged 23.4\% under fallow land, 20.3\% under fertilized cropland, 21.6\% under unfertilized cropland, and 16.0\% under continuous alfalfa. Compared to measurements at the start of the experiment, both fallow land and unfertilized cropland increased soil water storage in the 15-m loess profiles. In contrast, continuous alfalfa reduced soil water storage. Fertilized cropland has no significant effect on soil water storage. These results suggest that deep soil water can be replenished under the fallow and unfertilized farming systems. Dry soil layers (i.e., those which have soil water content less than the stable field water capacity) in the subsoil of the Changwu Tableland region can be classified as either temporary dry soil layers or persistent dry soil layers. Temporary dry soil layers, which typically form under annual crops, often disappear during wet years. Persistent dry soil layers generally develop under perennial vegetation. Even after removing the vegetation, persistent dry soil layers remain for several decades. This study provides information useful for the conservation and utilization of soil water resources in the Loess Tableland.},

	abstract = {Farmers in Central India practice a unique rain water management system ('Haveli') based on impounding rain water in the fields during three months monsoon season (June-September) and draining out in October. Winter crops, mainly grain legumes are then grown that utilize the soil moisture conserved in the soil profile. We monitored the soil physico-chemical and fertility properties, C and N mineralization, microbial populations and biomass and soil enzymes in the 0-30 cm soil layer at ten sites over three years at four stages viz., prior to submergence in summer (PS), during water-logging (WL), after drainage (AD) and after legume cropping (AC). Anaerobic conditions during water-logging (for 11 weeks) led to extensive losses of soil carbon amounting to 1900 mg C kg(-1) soil but no significant change in soil N. Post-drainage and decomposition of weeds (for 6 weeks), there was an increase in soil C of 3700 mg C kg(-1) and soil N of 74.1 mg N kg(-1) soil. Overall in 17 weeks, there was a net increase of 1800 mg C kg(-1) (+30.5\%) and 87.5 mg N kg(-1) (+20.1\%) amounting to soil C and N accretion rate of 15.1 mg C kg(-1) soil day and 0.74 mg N kg(-1) soil day. Microbial biomass decreased by 19.7\% during 11 weeks of water logging and improved by 54\% in the 6 weeks aerobic phase; an overall increment of 23.5\% (31 mg microbial C kg(-1)) in 17 weeks. Prolonged water-logging induced severe stress on microbial processes. However, post-drainage, there was significant improvement in microbial populations, nitrogen mineralization, soil enzymes and soil fertility. There were strong relationships between soil enzymes and microbial carbon; and, nitrogen mineralization and soil carbon. Results unequivocally demonstrated the benefits of rain-water conservation in Vertisols for carbon sequestration and nitrogen accretion and improvement of soil biological quality.

	abstract = {Yield decline or stagnation under long-term cultivation and its relationship with soil organic matter fractions are rarely considered. To understand this phenomenon, soil organic matter fractions and soil aggregate size distribution were studied in a long-term experiment at Akola, in a Vertisol in a semiarid tropical environment. For 14 years, the following fertiliser treatments were compared with undisturbed fallow plots: unfertilised (control), 100\% recommended rates of N, NP, NPK (N: P: K ratios of 100: 21.8: 18.2 and 120: 26.2: 50 kg/ha for sorghum and wheat, respectively) and 100\% NPK plus farmyard manure (FYM) and continuous cropping with a sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) system during 1988-2001. The significant negative yield trend was observed in unbalanced use of inorganic N application for both crops. However, yields were maintained when NPK and NPK + FYM were applied. Results showed that soil organic C and total N in the unfertilised plot decreased by 21.7 and 18.2\%, compared to the initial value, at a depth of 0-15 cm. Depletion of large macroaggregates ({\textgreater} 2 mm) accounted for 22-81\% of the total mass of aggregates in N, NP and unfertilised control plots compared to fallow plots. Irrespective of treatments, small macroaggregates (0.25-2 mm) dominated aggregate size distribution (56-71\%), followed by microaggregates (0.053-0.25 mm, 18-37\%). Active fractions, such as microbial biomass C, microbial biomass N, hot water soluble C and N, and acid hydrolysable carbohydrates were greater in NPK and NPK + FYM treatments than in the control. Carbon and N mineralisation were greater in small macroaggregates than microaggregates. Particulate organic matter C (POMC) and N (POMN) were significantly correlated (P {\textless} 0.01) with water-stable aggregate C and N (0.25-2 mm size classes), respectively. It was further observed that POMC and POMN were significantly greater in NPK and NPK + FYM plots than N and NP treated plots. Microbial biomass C was positively correlated with acid-hydrolysable carbohydrates (r = 0.79, P {\textless} 0.05). Continuous cropping and fertiliser use also influenced humic acid C and fulvic acid C fractions of the soil organic matter. Acid-hydrolysable N proportion in humic acid was greater than fulvic acid and it was greatest in NPK + FYM treatments. Continuous application of 100\% NPK + FYM could restore soil organic carbon (SOC) to a new equilibrium level much earlier (t = 1/k, 2.4 years) than N (t = 1/k, 25.7 years), NP (t = 1/k, 8.1 years) and NPK (t = 1/k, 5.02 years). In conclusion, integrated use of NPK with FYM would be vital to obtain sustainable yields without deteriorating soil quality.},

	abstract = {The performances of six time-domain reflectometry (TDR) and frequency-domain reflectometry (FDR) type soil moisture sensors were investigated for measuring volumetric soil-water content (theta(nu)) in two different soil types. Soil-specific calibration equations were developed for each sensor using calibrated neutron probe-measured theta(nu.) Sensors were also investigated for their performance response in measuring theta(nu) to changes in soil temperature. The performance of all sensors was significantly different (P{\textless}0.05) than the neutron probe-measured theta(nu) with the same sensor also exhibiting variation between soils. In the silt loam soil, the 5TE sensor had the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.041 m(3)/m(3), indicating the best performance among all sensors investigated. The performance ranking of the other sensors from high performance to low was: TDR300 (High Clay Mode), CS616 (H) and 10HS, SA4150, TDR300 (Standard Mode), and CS616 (V) (H: horizontal installation and V: vertical installation). In the loamy sand, the CS616 (H) performed best with an RMSE of 0.014 m(3)/m(3) and the performance ranking of other sensors was: 5TE, CS616 (V), TDR300 (S), SA4150, and 10HS. When theta(nu) was near or above field capacity, the performance error of most sensors increased. Most sensors exhibited a linear response to increase in soil temperature. Most sensors exhibited substantial sensitivity to changes in soil temperature and the a response of the same sensor to high vs. normal soil temperatures differed significantly between the soils. All sensors underestimated theta(nu) in high temperature range in both soils. The ranking order of the magnitude of change in theta(nu) in response to 1 degrees C increase in soil temperature (from the lowest to the greatest impact of soil temperature on sensor performance) in silt loam soil was: SA4150, 5TE, TDR300 (S), 10HS, CS620, CS616 (H), and CS616 (V). The ranking order from lower to higher sensitivity to soil temperature changes in loamy sand was: 10HS, CS616 (H), 5TE, CS616 (V), SA4150, and TDR300 (S). When the data from all sensors and soils are pooled, the overall average of change in theta(nu) for a 1 degrees C increase in soil temperature was 0.21 m(3)/m(3) in silt loam soil and -0.052 m(3)/m(3) in loamy sand. When all TDR- and FDR-type sensors were pooled separately for both soils, the average change in theta(nu) for a 1 degrees C increase in soil temperature for the TDR- and FDR-type sensors was 0.1918 and -0.0273 m(3)/m(3), respectively, indicating that overall TDR-type sensors are more sensitive to soil temperature changes than FDR-type sensors when measuring theta(nu).},

	abstract = {Tillage practices may affect the active fraction of soil organic N. As part of a national project to examine soil management and environmental controls on the active fraction of organic N, this study examined the effects of no-till (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems on the quantity of potentially mineralizable soil N (N-0) and mineralizable N pools, and the potential to detect changes in these pools using N availability indices. Preplant soil samples from the top 15 cm were collected from four long-term tillage experiments at Swift Current, SK; Woodslee, ON; L'Acadie, QC; and Agassiz, BC. Potentially mineralizable N was determined by aerobic incubation at 25 degrees C and periodic leaching for 24 wk. The N-0 was greater under NT than under CT but only at Swift Current. The labile and intermediate mineralizable N pools were significantly higher under NT than under CT at three of the four sites. The stable mineralizable N pool and the mineralization rate coefficient (k) were greater under NT than under CT at only one of the four sites. Adoption of NT influenced the quality of the active organic N fraction at three sites, as indicated by an increased proportion of mineralizable N in the more labile N pools. Among tested indices of N availability, KCl-extractable NH4-N, NaOH-extractable N, Illinois Soil N Test, phosphate-borate buffer extractable N, and particulate organic C were most sensitive to tillage-induced changes in the active organic N fraction. Tillage-induced changes in the size and quality of the active organic N fraction may influence soil N supply and should be considered in optimizing fertilizer N management.},

Sources of hydrogen near the ground, other than soil moisture, affect the neutron measurement and therefore must be quantified. This study investigates the effect of atmospheric water vapor on the cosmic-ray probe signal and evaluates the fast neutron response in realistic atmospheric conditions using the neutron transport code Monte Carlo N-Particle eXtended (MCNPX). The vertical height of influence of the sensor in the atmosphere varies between 412 and 265 m in dry and wet atmospheres, respectively. Model results show that atmospheric water vapor near the surface affects the neutron intensity signal by up to 12\%, corresponding to soil moisture differences on the order of 0.10 m(3) m(-3). A simple correction is defined to identify the true signal associated with integrated soil moisture that rescales the measured neutron intensity to that which would have been observed in the atmospheric conditions prevailing on the day of sensor calibration. Use of this approach is investigated with in situ observations at two sites characterized by strong seasonality in water vapor where standard meteorological measurements are readily available.},

In this experiment, a closed loop control system based on the relationship of electrical resistance and soil moisture was used to test the performence of the automated drip irrigation system for pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) growth. A main strategy for irrigation was determined before irrigation events and the pot (100k Omega) in the circuit was adjusted to the strategy determined before, thereafter a signal was produced by the electrodes embedded in the substrate whenever soil moisture reached to the threshold level. Therefore, the system took over irrigation events, started and stopped the irrigations throughout the entire growing season. The irrigation times and amounts of irrigation water applied by the system was not suitable for uniform crop production, because irrigation throuhout the whole growing season was commenced as almost 55\% of the available soil moisture was depleted from field capacity (FC).},

	abstract = {Precipitation analysis and soil moisture from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) are used to assess the land-atmosphere coupling in boreal summer. Correlations between antecedent soil moisture and precipitation suggest that regions of strong land-atmosphere coupling lie mainly in arid to semiarid transition zones or in semihumid forest to grassland transition zones. They consist of central Eurasia, the region from Mongolia to northern China, southwest China, the Sahel, the northern continental United States, and southern Europe. It is found that over these regions, positive soil moisture feedback accounts for typically 10-20\% of the variance of monthly precipitation anomalies with the feedback efficiency of the order of 0.3-0.9 mm month(-1) (0.1 standardized soil moisture)(-1). While soil moisture feedback is dominated by the positive sign, negative feedback may exist in some areas, such as India and the western part and Quebec province of Canada. Generally, the land-atmosphere coupling strength estimated from the GLDAS data agrees well with those from the observational soil moisture in Illinois and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 40-year reanalysis (ERA-40) soil moisture product. Physical mechanisms responsible for the findings are further discussed. This study provides a Northern Hemisphere distribution of the land-atmosphere coupling strength, which can be used to test the model simulations on monthly to seasonal time scales.},

Moreover, the flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a fully 2D hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved. The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in Genoa in northwestern Italy.

Toward this goal, such a framework has been developed by linking the Community Land Model, version 4 (CLM4), and a microwave radiative transfer model (RTM) with the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART). The deterministic ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF) within DART is utilized to estimate global multilayer soil moisture by assimilating brightness temperature observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E). A 40-member ensemble of Community Atmosphere Model, version 4.0 (CAM4.0), reanalysis is adopted to drive CLM4 simulations. Space-specific, time-invariant microwave parameters are precalibrated to minimize uncertainties in RTM. Besides, various methods are designed to upscale AMSR-E observations for computational efficiency and time shift CAM4.0 forcing to facilitate global daily assimilations. A series of experiments are conducted to quantify the DA sensitivity to microwave parameters, choice of assimilated observations, and different CLM4 updating schemes. Evaluation results indicate that the newly established CLM4-RTM-DART framework improves the open-loop CLM4-simulated soil moisture. Precalibrated microwave parameters, rather than their default values, can ensure a more robust global-scale performance. In addition, updating near-surface soil moisture is capable of improving soil moisture in deeper layers (0-30 cm), while simultaneously updating multilayer soil moisture fails to obtain intended improvements. Future work is needed to address the systematic bias in CLM4 that cannot be fully covered through the ensemble spread in CAM4.0 reanalysis.},

Growing barley and legumes for grain and forage in pistachio, olive and vineyards is a common alley cropping system applied in the southeastern Turkey. However, this practice is not being widely used by farmers because of their concern of that these forage crops severely compete the trees for water and nutrients. This study was therefore conducted to observe temporal variation in soil moisture content (SMC) under an alley cropping systems in pistachio to investigate the competition between main and secondary crops for SM in three alley cropping systems and to suggest the most proper alley crops to farmers in the region. The experiment was conducted in an orchard of 20 year-old pistachio trees. There were no differences in SM content among the four treatments from beginning until April 19, 2009. However, the means were significantly different after this date (April 19, 2009). The soil moisture deficit (SMD) calculated was 27.4 mm for control compared to 45.1 mm for alley cropped treatments. Even though there were no significant differences in SMC among the treatments during the whole experimental period, the effect of treatments on the yield or other physiological characteristics of pistachio trees needs investigating for a sound decision on the selection of the best alley cropping system.

	abstract = {In situ soil moisture monitoring networks are critical to the development of soil moisture remote sensing missions as well as agricultural and environmental management, weather forecasting, and many other endeavors. These in situ networks utilize a variety of sensors and installation practices, which confounds the development of a unified reference database for satellite calibration and validation programs. As part of the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission, the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (SMAP-MOISST) was initiated to perform inter-comparisons and study sensor limitations. Soil moisture sensors that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600 m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM, Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system. In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an RMSE below 0.04 m(3) m(-3). For most sensor types, a single near surface sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0.03 m(3) m(-3).},

In Loess Plateau in China, where soil erosion is a major issue, information about soil water content helps in the planning of regional water resources and vegetation restoration for the prevention of erosion. In this study, we have developed the SWEST (soil water estimation from surface temperature) method by integrating well-known relationships among surface temperature, evapotranspiration and soil water content. An advantage of the proposed SWEST method is that it can estimate soil water content for the location of a water source of evapotranspiration, where there would be a near-surface for bare soil and the root zone for well vegetated surfaces. A verification study conducted at Liudaogou River Basin of the Loess Plateau, China, indicated the method could estimate soil water content accurately, with an estimation error of about 2.6\% of the total volume of soil. Application of the method to satellite thermal imaging successfully presented the applicability of the SWEST method to estimate soil water content with spatial and temporal variability.

The main aim of the study was to relate soil Olsen-P to apparent P balance and to determine Olsen-P critical value for early and late rice using data from a 29-year study (1984-2012) at the Jiangxi province. The results showed that Olsen-P decreased by 0.12-0.26 mg/kg/year without P addition and increased by 0.56-2.52 mg/kg/year with P fertilization. Olsen-P decreased by 0.30 mg/kg for CK and NK under an average deficit of 100 kg P/ha, and increased by an average of 9.10 mg/kg in treatments with organic manures and were 4.55 times higher than chemical fertilizers with 100 kg/ha of P surplus. The critical values for early and late rice were 22.70 and 22.67 mg/kg, respectively. The average Olsen-P content is 90.89 mg/kg after 29-year application of chemical fertilizer and manures. Therefore, decreasing the amount of total P input and increasing the compost portion should be recommended to improve food production and protect environment in red paddy soils in south China.},

	abstract = {Rural areas represent approximately 95\% of the 14000 km(2) Alabama Black Belt, an area of widespread Vertisols dominated by clayey, smectitic, shrink-swell soils. These soils are unsuitable for conventional onsite wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) which are nevertheless widely used in this region. In order to provide an alternative wastewater dosing system, an experimental field moisture controlled subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) system was designed and installed as a field trial. The experimental system that integrates a seasonal cropping system was evaluated for two years on a 500-m(2) Houston clay site in west central Alabama from August 2006 to June 2008. The SDI system was designed to start hydraulic dosing only when field moisture was below field capacity. Hydraulic dosing rates fluctuated as expected with higher dosing rates during warm seasons with near zero or zero dosing rates during cold seasons. Lower hydraulic dosing in winter creates the need for at least a two-month waste storage structure which is an insurmountable challenge for rural homeowners. An estimated 30\% of dosed water percolated below 45-cm depth during the first summer which included a 30-year historic drought. This massive volume of percolation was presumably the result of preferential flow stimulated by dry weather clay soil cracking. Although water percolation is necessary for OWTS, this massive water percolation loss indicated that this experimental system is not able to effective control soil moisture within its monitoring zone as designed. Overall findings of this study indicated that soil moisture controlled SDI wastewater dosing is not suitable as a standalone system in these Vertisols. However, the experimental soil moisture control system functioned as designed, demonstrating that soil moisture controlled SDI wastewater dosing may find application as a supplement to other wastewater disposal methods that can function during cold seasons.

	abstract = {The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) currently prepares the assimilation of soil moisture data derived from advanced scatterometer (ASCAT) measurements. ASCAT is part of the MetOp satellite payload launched in November 2006 and will ensure the operational provision of soil moisture information until at least 2020. Several studies showed that soil moisture derived from scatterometer data contain skillful information. Based on data from its predecessor instruments, the ERS-1/2 scatterometers we examine the potential of future ASCAT soil moisture data for numerical weather prediction (NWP). In a first step, we compare nine years of the ERS scatterometer derived surface soil moisture index (Theta(S)) against soil moisture from the ECMWF re-analysis (ERA40) data set (Theta(E)) to (i) identify systematic differences and (ii) derive a transfer function which minimises these differences and transforms Theta(S) into model equivalent volumetric soil moisture Theta(S)*. We then use a nudging scheme to assimilate Theta(S)* in the soil moisture analysis of the ECMWF numerical weather prediction model. In this scheme the difference between Theta(S)* and the model first guess Theta(FG), calculated at 1200 UTC, is added in 1/4 fractions throughout a 24 h window to the model resulting in analysed soil moisture Theta(NDG). We compare results from this experiment against those from a control experiment where soil moisture evolved freely and against those from the operational ECMWF forecast system, which uses an optimum interpolation scheme to analyse soil moisture. Validation against field observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet, shows that the assimilation of Theta(S)* increases the correlation from 0.39 to 0.66 and decreases the RMSE from 0.055 m(3) m(-3) to 0.041 m(3) m(-3) compared against the control experiment. The corresponding forecasts for low level temperature and humidity improve only Marginally compared to the control experiment and deteriorate compared to the operational system. In addition, the results suggest that an advanced data assimilation system, like the Extended Kalman Filter, could use the satellite observations more effectively. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The objective of this study is to incorporate a time-dependent Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) based Curve Number method (SMA\_CN) in Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and compare its performance with the existing CN method in SWAT by simulating the hydrology of two agricultural watersheds in Indiana, USA. Results show that fusion of the SMA\_CN method causes decrease in runoff volume and increase in profile soil moisture content, associated with larger groundwater contribution to the streamflow. In addition, the higher amount of moisture in the soil profile slightly elevates the actual evapotranspiration. The SMA-based SWAT configuration consistently produces improved goodness-of-fit scores and less uncertain outputs with respect to streamflow during both calibration and validation. The SMA\_CN method exhibits a better match with the observed data for all flow regimes, thereby addressing issues related to peak and low flow predictions by SWAT in many past studies. Comparison of the calibrated model outputs with field-scale soil moisture observations reveals that the SMA overhauling enables SWAT to represent soil moisture condition more accurately, with better response to the incident rainfall dynamics. While the results from the modification of the CN method in SWAT are promising, more studies including watersheds with various physical and climatic settings are needed to validate the proposed approach.

	abstract = {The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration. While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR)remote sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of soil moisture within a 55-km(2) Alpine foothill river catchment in Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought into synergy for a 9-ha grassland and several other locations within the catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm. The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29 with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter product as a biomass water proxy.},

	abstract = {Understanding the role of vegetation in the interface between the atmosphere and groundwater is the most decisive key in analyzing the processes involved in water transfer. The main effect of vegetation is its root water uptake, which significantly modifies the processes involved in water transfer in the vadose zone. This paper focuses on mapping temporal and spatial changes in soil moisture using electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The main objective is to assess how electrical resistivity (ER) is useful for mapping water distribution along a heterogeneous toposequence crossed by a hedgerow. Ten ERT were performed over the studied period for a 28m long toposequence and compared to matric potential and groundwater level measurements. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) was predicted with two methods: (i) from ER using the Waxman and Smits model (ii) and from matric potential using an experimental retention curve fitted by a Van Genuchten model. Probability density functions (PDFs) of our set of data show that the largest change in mean ER and matric potential was observed in the topsoil layer. We then analyzed the consistency between ER and point measurements in this layer by extracting the arrays at the junction of ER grids and point measurements. PDFs of ER maps at each monitoring time (from T01 to T10) were also calculated to select the most contrasting distributions, corresponding to the wettest (T06) and driest states (T10). Results of ER were consistent with matric-potential measurements, with two different behaviors for locations inside and outside the root zone. A consistent correlation between VWC values from the Waxman and Smits model and those obtained from the retention curve was observed outside the root zone. The heterogeneous soil system inside the root zone shows a different pattern in this relationship. A shift in the relationship between ER and soil moisture for the locations outside and inside the root zone highlights the nonstationarity between wet and dry periods inside the root zone. The equivocal behavior of this relationship shows the limitation of using ER to predict soil moisture in a heterogeneous soil system. Such systems were actually related to the high hedgerow root density and also to a particular topographical context (ditch and bank) that is encountered in Brittany and throughout northwestern Europe.},

	abstract = {The Soil Conservation Service curve number (CN) method commonly uses three discrete levels of soil antecedent moisture condition (AMC), defined by the 5-day antecedent rainfall depth, to describe soil moisture prior to a runoff event. However, this way may not adequately represent soil water conditions of fields and watersheds in the Loess Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effective soil moisture depth to which the CN is most related, (2) to evaluate a discrete and a linear relationship between AMC and soil moisture; and (3) to develop an equation between CN and Soil moisture to predict runoff better for the climatic and soil conditions of the Loess Plateau of China. The dataset consisted of 10 years of rainfall, runoff and soil moisture measurements from four experimental plots cropped with millet, pasture and potatoes. Results indicate that the standard CN method underestimated runoff depths for 85 of the 98 observed plot-runoff events, with a model efficiency E of only 0.243. For our experimental conditions, the discrete and linear approaches improved runoff estimation, but still underestimated most runoff events, with E values of 0.428 and 0.445 respectively. Based on the measured CN values and soil moisture values in the top 15 cm of the soil, a non-linear equation was developed that predicted runoff better with an E value of 0.779. This modified CN equation was the most appropriate for runoff prediction in the study area, but may need adjustments for local conditions in the Loess Plateau of China.

	abstract = {Ecological restoration of high-quality, semi-natural communities of conservation value on ex-arable soils with raised fertility has been a major problem in northern Europe. One suggested way of tackling this problem is to use Full-Inversion Tillage (FIT) where the fertile top-soil is moved below infertile subsurface layers. This should provide infertile conditions at least in the short- to medium-term for the establishment of communities that require these conditions. Here, we pioneer a rigorous test of the efficacy of this approach. Our new method, using Principal Response Curves (PRCs), overcomes the difficulty in testing for change in soil physico-chemical properties down soil profiles with the inherent problem of autocorrelations between soil layers. Principal Response Curves (PRCs) is a multivariate technique, usually used to test for effects of treatment effects through time on a community matrix. We propose an extension of their use for the multivariate analysis of properties down a soil-depth profile. We tested the effects of FIT in two contrasting soils, before and after treatment. In a clay loam soil, FIT was effective in reducing the soil fertility in the surface 12 cm. Indeed the soil available P concentration, a key variable, was more than halved in the surface layers, and was below the lowest literature target threshold for the establishment of semi-natural grassland. In contrast, in the sandy soil, soil properties increased throughout the profile after FIT, primarily because of the pre-treatment nutrient distribution within the soil. Before FIT treatment, the maximum concentrations of most measured variables were at mid-depth and FIT redistributed these to the surface and bottom layers. Our results demonstrate the potential for FIT in ecological restoration, but indicate that its efficacy depends on soil type and the site history. We recommend that in future a pre-treatment assessment of soil properties with depth is undertaken before FIT is implemented, and that afterwards our PRC approach can be used to test efficacy immediately after treatment, and has the potential for measuring soil resilience to perturbation through time.

The method has been proven suitable for estimating soil moisture for a wide range of land covers and soil types and has been used for hydrological modeling, data assimilation, and calibration and validation of satellite products. The method is challenged by the effect on neutron intensity of other hydrogen pools such as vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. Identifying the signal of the different pools can be used to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture method as well as extend the application to, e.g., biomass and canopy interception surveying.

	abstract = {Accurate measurement of soil moisture (theta), bulk electrical conductivity (sigma(b)), and porewater electrical conductivity (sigma(w)) in the vadose zone is critical for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications. The use of combined dielectric probes allows for the automated collection of high-resolution, long-term data, however variation in probe response to different soil types can lead to unacceptably large measurement errors, especially in soils with high organic content such as those found in wetlands. The objectives of this study were to calibrate and field-test a combined, capacitance-based dielectric probe for three soil series encountered in the floodplain of a southeastern (USA) coastal river where watershed modifications have led to reduced freshwater flow and saltwater intrusion. To calibrate the probe, floodplain soils were categorized into three groups: a low organic content fine sand; a moderately organic, depositional fluvent soil; and a highly organic muck. PVC soil cores were packed at field bulk density, and theta and sigma(b) were measured in the lab over a range of soil moistures (pressure potentials of 0-333 cm H2O) and sigma(w) values (0.01-1.0 S/m). Soil dielectric properties measured with the probe were used to test several potential models relating real and imaginary dielectric constants to theta, sigma(b), and sigma(w). Soil-specific calibrations improved theta estimation over standard manufacturer calibrations, particularly for the more organic soils. Of all theta-sigma(b)-sigma(w) models tested, the empirical relationship proposed by Vogeler et al. (1996) performed the best (overall R-2=0.97 for the three soils), though all models performed well in all soils (0.94 {\textless}= R-2 {\textless}= 0.98) and each can be selected for the specific range of sigma(b) expected in the field. Calibrations were successfully tested in the field by comparing in-ground probe estimates of sigma(w) with collocated soil water samples. These calibrations add to the limited published data available for soils of high organic content and support accurate monitoring of the vadose zone in coastal wetlands to inform restoration and management of these valued ecosystems.

During the Monsoon `90 experiment, eight ground-based meteorological and flux stations were operating over the 150km(2) study area simultaneously with the acquisition of the aircraft-based L-band PBMR data. The heterogeneous scene is hence composed of eight subpixels and the microwave pixel is generated by aggregating the microwave emission of all sites. The results indicate a good agreement between the downscaled and ground-based soil moisture as long as the intensity of solar radiation is sufficiently high to use the soil temperature as a tracer of the spatial variability of near-surface soil moisture.

	abstract = {In spite of the importance of phosphorus (P) as a limiting nutrient in terrestrial ecosystems, our understanding of terrestrial P dynamics and our ability to model P cycling are hampered by the lack of consistent measurements of soil P. The Hedley fractionation method provides a comprehensive assessment of soil P and has been widely used in recent decades. Here we expand an earlier study that summarized Hedley P data from the literature to create a larger Hedley P database and further investigate the relationships between distributions of different forms of P and the stages of soil development. Our expanded Hedley P database generally supports what the Walker and Syers (1976) conceptual model predicts: the gradual decrease and eventual depletion of primary mineral P (mainly apatite P); the continual increase and eventual dominance of occluded P; and the overall decrease of total P during soil development. However the analysis disagrees with Walker and Syers (1976) in that we found labile inorganic P(Pi) and secondary mineral Pi (non-occluded P in Walker and Syers' model) to be a significant fraction of total P throughout all soil orders with different weathering stages. By analyzing the Hedley-labile P and vegetation P demand, we found that the amount of labile P is much greater than vegetation demand, even in highly weathered soils commonly considered P limited. We conclude that labile P measured by Hedley fractionation method should not be defined as plant available P since most of this labile P likely ends up as immobilized by microbes. Our analysis of the database also shows that carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil organic matter are closely linked in all soil orders, but P is decoupled from C and N in highly weathered soils with larger variations of nitrogen: organic P (N:Po) ratio and higher mean values of N: Po ratio, compared to slightly and intermediately weathered soils.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with the tuning of the free parameters of the Support Vector Regression technique used for the retrieval of geo/bio-physical variables from remotely sensed data. We propose to address this task in the framework of the multi-objective optimization. A multi-objective function is defined based on a set of two (or more) metrics (e. g., mean squared error MSE and determination coefficient R-2) that quantify from different (and sometimes competing) perspectives the goodness of a given parameter configuration. Then the metrics are jointly optimized according to the concept of Pareto optimality. This allows preserving the meaning of each metric and deriving multiple optimal solutions to the tuning problem. Each solution leads to a different optimal trade-off among the considered metrics. The main advantages of the proposed multi-objective parameter optimization approach with respect to traditional mono-objective strategies are: 1) the intrinsic improved robustness and efficiency, since multiple metrics are jointly exploited in the tuning of the free parameters of the considered regression method; and 2) the possibility to select the parameter configuration that leads to the desired trade-off among different criteria and thus best meets both the application constraints and the requirements of the specific estimation problem. The experimental analysis was focused on the challenging application domain of soil moisture retrieval from microwave remotely sensed data. The results obtained on data sets associated with two different operative conditions are very promising and show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in comparison with more traditional tuning strategies based on a single metric and its usefulness in defining estimation systems for real application domains.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion processes in vineyards, beyond surface runoff and sediment transport, have a strong effect on soil organic carbon (SOC) loss and redistribution along the slope. Variation in SOC across the landscape can determine differences in soil fertility and vine vigor. The goal of this research was to analyze the interactions among vines vigor, sediment delivery and SOC in a sloping vineyard located in Sicily. Six pedons were studied along the slope by digging 6 pits up to 60 cm depth. Soil was sampled every 10 cm and SOC, water extractable organic carbon (WEOC) and specific ultraviolet absorbance (SUVA) were analyzed. Erosion rates, detachment and deposition areas were measured by the pole height method which allowed mapping of the soil redistribution. The vigor of vegetation, expressed as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), derived from high-resolution satellite multispectral data, was compared with measured pruning weight. Results confirmed that soil erosion, sediment redistribution and SOC across the slope was strongly affected by topographic features, slope and curvature. The erosion rate was 16Mg ha(-1) y(-1) since the time of planting (6 years). SOC redistribution was strongly correlated with the detachment or deposition areas as highlighted by pole height measurements. The off-farm SOC loss over six years amounted to 1.2 Mg C ha(-1). SUVA(254) values, which indicate hydrophobic material rich in aromatic constituents of WEOC, decreased significantly along the slope, demonstrating that WEOC in the detachment site is more stable in comparison to deposition sites. The plant vigor was strongly correlated with WEOC constituents. Results demonstrated that high resolution passive remote sensing data combined with soil and plant analyses can survey areas with contrasting SOC, soil fertility, soil erosion and plant vigor. This will allow monitoring of soil erosion and degradation risk areas and support decision-makers in developing measures for friendly environmental management. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

	doi = {10.1016/j.rse.2018.11.021},
	abstract = {A radiative transfer and process-based model, called Soil-Canopy-Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE), relates remote sensing signals with plant functioning (i.e., photosynthesis and evapotranspiration). Relying on optical remote sensing data, the SCOPE model estimates photosynthesis and evapotranspiration, but these ecosystem-level fluxes may be significantly overestimated if water availability is the primary limiting factor for vegetation. Remedying this shortcoming, additional information from extra sources is needed. In this study, we propose considering water stress in SCOPE by incorporating soil moisture data in the model, besides using satellite optical reflectance observations. A functional link between soil moisture, soil surface resistance, leaf water potential and carboxylation capacity is introduced as an extra element in SCOPE, resulting in a soil moisture integrated version of the model, SCOPE-SM. The modified model simulates additional state variables: (i) vapor pressure (e(i)), both in the soil pore space and leaf stomata in equilibrium with liquid water potential; (ii) the maximum carboxylation capacity (V-cmax) by a soil moisture dependent stress factor; and (iii) the soil surface resistance (r(ss)) through approximation by a soil moisture dependent hydraulic conductivity. The new approach was evaluated at a Fluxnet site (US-Var) with dominant C3 grasses and covering a wet-to-dry episode from January to August 2004. By using the original SCOPE (version 1.61), we simulated half-hourly time steps of plant functioning via locally measured weather data and time series of Landsat (TM and ETM) imagery. Then, SCOPE-SM was similarly applied to simulate plant functioning for three cases using Landsat imagery: (i) with modeled e(i); (ii) with modeled ei and V-cmax; and (iii) with modeled e(i) V-cmax and r(ss). The outputs of all four simulations were compared to flux tower plant functioning measurements. The results indicate a significant improvement proceeding from the first to the fourth case in which we used both Landsat optical imagery and soil moisture data through SCOPE-SM. Our results show that the combined use of optical reflectance and soil moisture observations has great potential to capture variations of photosynthesis and evapotranspiration during drought episodes. Further, we found that the information contained in soil moisture observations can describe more variations of measured evapotranspiration compared to the information contained in thermal observations.},

In-situ SM observations together with a remotely sensed SM dataset retrieved by the Vienna University of Technology are used to validate the model. In the VIP model, climate-eco-hydrological (CEH) variables such as precipitation, air temperature and runoff observations and also simulated evapotranspiration (E-T), leaf area index (LAI), and vegetation production are used to analyze the soil moisture evolution mechanism. The results show that the model is able to capture seasonal SM variations. The seasonal pattern, multi-year variation, standard deviation and coefficient of variation (C-V) of SM at the daily, monthly and annual scale are well explained by CEH variables. The annual and inter-annual variability of SM is the lowest compared with that of other CEH variables. The trend analysis shows that SM is in decreasing tendency at alpha=0.01 level of significance, confirming the Northern Drying phenomenon. This trend can be well explained by the decreasing tendency of precipitation (alpha=0.1) and increasing tendency of temperature (alpha=0.01). The decreasing tendency of runoff has higher significance level (alpha=0.001). Because of SM's decreasing tendency, soil evaporation (E-S) is also decreasing (alpha=0.05). The tendency of net radiation (R-n), evapotranspiration (E-T), transpiration (E-C), canopy intercept (E-I) is not obvious. Net primary productivity (NPP), of which the significance level is lower than alpha=0.1, and gross primary productivity (GPP) at alpha=0.01 are in increasing tendency.},

The research was carried out from January to May 2008. The latitude and longitude of the farmland were taken with the global position system receiver and the data input into the computer system. ArcView 3.3 software programme was used to generate the boundary of the farmland from the coordinates while the topographic and slope maps were generated with the elevation data. The soil fertility investigation was carried out by locating sampling pits for soil samples collection on the basis of soil slope relationship for which the entire landscape was categorized into two slope types of 0.5 to 8\% and 8 to 15\%. Soil samples were collected at surface (0-30 cm) and subsoil (30-100 cm) across the slopes for the soil physical and chemical properties. The average values of soil data were computed using ArcView statistical analysis tools. The results of analysis showed the soil to be sandy loam in the surface and sandy clay loam in the subsoil. The gravel content was higher in the subsoil compared to surface soil and the soil which was slightly acidic to neutral had higher organic matter, total exchangeable bases and cation exchange capacity in the surface soil compared to the subsoil. The soil fertility was adjudged to be of moderate productivity and found suitable for arable crop production but can only be sustained with addition of organic and inorganic fertilizers in a continuous cropping over the years. The application of geospatial technologies had generated a digital map of the farmland to make possible a periodic review of the fertility status.},

	abstract = {Hydrological service by soil under mountain ecosystems is a hot topic in current ecological research. We monitored the precipitation and soil moisture dynamics and measured the soil hydrological parameters of grassland and forest ecosystems along an elevation gradient in the Dayekou catchment of the central Qilian Mountains in northwestern China. Soil moisture dynamics in response to rainfall events exhibit different characteristics with different ecosystems and at different elevations. The soil conditions (including soil texture, soil structure, and soil hydrological parameters), the local meteorological condition, and the physiological characteristics of the vegetation can help explain eco-hydrological differences. The total rainfall increased with an increase in elevation across the rainy season. Soil moisture content increased with an increase in altitude and differs with land cover on average values. Grassland and forest at low elevations have 50\% and 41.7\% of the soil moisture content level under shrubland at high elevations, and Qinghai spruce forest soil has the greatest “green water (the water used mainly by the ecosystem itself)” capacity. Fluctuation in soil moisture diminishes with increased depth, yet the trend is not obvious under shrubland at high elevations. The sensitivity of soil moisture response to rainfall differed depending on land cover and soil depth. Soil moisture under alpine shrubland is far more sensitive to single rainfall events, whereas other land-cover types display only typical responses in periods of frequent rainfall events (continued-rainfall scale). The study of soil moisture dynamics contributes to research on hydrological service in mountain ecosystems, and is helpful in promoting knowledge innovation regarding the relationship between water and ecosystems.

The causes of food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa include among others; poverty, economic constraints, agricultural and agronomical challenges, rapid population growth, and the effects of adverse climate change. These causes however, are linked to complex interactions, constraints and dependencies amongst the key physical resources in food systems, namely - Water, Land, Energy and Soil Nutrients (WLEN). There is limited insight on the combined impacts of the resource nexus, and how this may constrain the performance of food systems in Sub-Saharan Africa. This understanding is essential if the food challenges in the region are to be tackled sustainably. This study provides a detailed analysis of the Uganda's 2012 WLEN nexus resources vis-a-vis the country's current and potential food demand using calorific-demand analysis and source-to-service resource transformation modelling. The analysis determines estimates of the current resource stresses within Uganda's insufficient food system and the interconnected resource implications for the achievement of food security by 2050. The results are visualised using Sankey diagrams. The inferences highlight evident limits across all four resources. Overall, the analysis helps to inform food security policy and the resource context for the present and future management of Uganda's food system. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper examines near-surface soil moisture data (top similar to 6 cm) from an Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAFC) monitoring network in southern Manitoba, Canada, over the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. This network is intended for use (in part) as a core validation site for the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission. The network currently consists of 9 stations sited within agricultural fields. Each station uses a triplicate configuration of horizontally installed Hydra Probe soil moisture sensors at near-surface (similar to 5 an) to root-zone soil depths, in addition to permanently installed vertical surface sensors (0-5.7 cm). This domain was studied intensively over the 6.5 week SMAPVEX12 ground campaign in June/July 2012, providing coincident soil moisture datasets to assess network up-scaling over the domain. Results demonstrate that statistical differences exist between the network-level data from the horizontal (theta(3.5-6.5cm)) and vertical (theta(0-5.7cm)) surface Hydra Probes over 2012-13. Bootstrap resampling shows that a mean difference of 0.018 m(3) m(-3) (at 99\% confidence) is observed between theta(3.5-6.5cm) and theta(0-5.7cm) measurement depths (theta(0-5.7cm) sensors exhibit dry bias). Individual station analysis shows that the largest differences between theta(3.5-6.5cm) and theta(0-5.7cm) measurement depth occur at sites with higher clay content, whereas sensors located in sandy soils exhibit negligible differences. Up-scaling comparisons of the AAFC network to field-sampled data and a dense temporary network over SMAPVEX12 demonstrate that it is representative of the domain within 0.04 m(3) m(-3) RMSE. This suggests that the AAFC network is suitable for coarse resolution L-band microwave soil moisture validation. Comparison of Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) Level 2 soil moisture product data to the up-scaled AAFC network data over 2012-13 shows that superior temporal correlation is found with the theta(0-5.7cm) dataset. The difference in RMSEs between the SMOS comparisons to theta(3.5-6.5cm) and theta(0-5.7cm) network datasets is approximately 0.018 m(3) m(-3). These results suggest that differences of near-surface measurement depth and sensor configuration should be considered when conducting L-band satellite validation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The sand was saturated carefully with water from the bottom to the top and was exposed to the natural climate for a period of about two months.

	abstract = {Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) Normalized-Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and soil moisture data from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager (SSM/I) were utilized to derive Soil Moisture Use Efficiency (SMUE). SMUE, serving here as a proxy for the commonly used Water Use Efficiency (WUE), was used to evaluate drought vulnerability (i.e., the degree of drought stress and sensitivity) in the Northeast Asia drylands for the period of 1987-2006. SMUE was defined as the ratio of June August NDVI accumulation (NDVIacc) to average soil moisture (SMavg). This ratio was utilized to derive two additional indices representing drought stress (DSI) and sensitivity (DVI). We confined our vulnerability analyses to low NDVI regions because the determination of SSM/I soil moisture is unreliable in areas with high biomass. Both DSI and DVI identified high drought vulnerability in regions of the eastern Kazakhstan grasslands, western portions of the Hexi Corridor in the mid-north of China, the Gobi region, and the southwestern Mongolia grasslands. The identified vulnerable regions covered most of regions with land-degradation expansions or increased sand storm occurrence reported from previous individual studies. This study demonstrated the applicability of our SMUE-based vulnerability indices for identifying drought vulnerability across wide geographic regions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Results indicated that soil EC1:5 SAR and pH values were reduced with the application of farm manure under brackish water application. While organic Carbon, Nitrogen, available Phosphorus and Potassium was improved by manure application. Although farm manure application increased the concentration of NPK but their concentration decreased as depth of soil increased. It can be concluded that farm manure application reduced the deleterious effects of brackish water as indicated in EC and pH, and enhanced the fertility level of the soil.},

Photo-assimilated C allocation in a wheat cropping system was examined to identify the links between soil fertility, C partitioning and soil C sequestration. A pulse labelling experiment was conducted where (CO2)-C-14 was introduced to wheat plants grown in two groups of soils of varying fertility: arable soils spiked with nutrients, and soils with differing land-use histories. Wheat shoot, root and soil samples were taken 1, 14 and 28 days after pulse labelling to examine the fluxes of C-14 in the plant-root-soil system. The partitioning of C-14 in wheat plant-root-soil system was found to vary with time, nutrient spiked soil fertility and land-use history. At the end of the experiment using spiked soils, a positive correlation was observed between the allocation of C-14 in the shoots and soil fertility, whereas in the roots, this relationship was negative. The overall allocation of C-14 in the plant-root system differed significantly between the land-use histories; while in the spiked arable soils C-14 allocation in the shoots and roots systematically followed their fertility status. There was a weak relationship between C allocation and soil fertility in the soils of different land-use history compared to the strong relationship in the spiked arable soils. This suggests that other factors in the soils under different land uses were more important than nutrient status alone in driving photo-assimilated C allocation. This study demonstrated that soil fertility and land-use history have a crucial role in the allocation of photo-assimilated C in the plant-soil system and are important factors by which C sequestration in soil may be impacted.},

Soil moisture content remains a recognised, yet currently uncharacterised source of segmentation error. This work sought to quantify the effect of soil moisture content on the ability to segment roots from soil in mu CT images. Rice (Oryza sativa) plants grown in contrasting soils (loamy sand and clay loam) were mu CT scanned daily for nine days whilst drying from saturation. Root volumes were segmented from mu CT images and compared with volumes derived by root washing. At saturation the overlapping attenuation values of root material, water-filled soil pores and soil organic matter significantly hindered segmentation. However, in dry soil (ca. six days of drying post-saturation) the air-filled pores increased image noise adjacent to roots and impeded accurate visualisation of root material. The root volume was most accurately segmented at field capacity. Root volumes can be accurately segmented from mu CT images of undisturbed soil without compromising the growth requirements of the plant providing soil moisture content is kept at field capacity. We propose all future studies in this area should consider the error associated with scanning at different soil moisture contents.},

These mesonetworks provide data from which detailed estimates of various hydrological parameters, such as precipitation and reference evapotranspiration, can be made which, when coupled with simple surface characteristics available from soil surveys, can be used to obtain estimates of soil moisture. The question is Can meteorological data be used with a simple hydrologic model to estimate accurately daily soil moisture at a mesonetwork site? Using a state-of-the-art mesonetwork that also includes soil moisture measurements across the US State of Delaware, the efficacy of a simple, modified Thornthwaite/Mather-based daily water balance model based on these mesonetwork observations to estimate site-specific soil moisture is determined. Results suggest that the model works reasonably well for most well-drained sites and provides good qualitative estimates of measured soil moisture, often near the accuracy of the soil moisture instrumentation. The model exhibits particular trouble in that it cannot properly simulate the slow drainage that occurs in poorly drained soils after heavy rains and interception loss, resulting from grass not being short cropped as expected also adversely affects the simulation. However, the model could be tuned to accommodate some non-standard siting characteristics.},

Observations of this case suggest that the soil-moisture heterogeneity and atmospheric gravity waves emitted from a parent' MCS were important trigger mechanisms for this system. This study uses high-resolution Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) simulations to assess the importance of the synoptic circulation, land-surface and gravity waves in the initiation and development of the MCS. During the early afternoon shallow convection developed over a region of dry soil within a synoptic-scale convergence zone, which was caused by the confluence of the southerly monsoon flow with winds associated with the circulation around the Saharan heat low. Two pronounced waves were emitted from a nearby parent' storm and propagated towards the convergence zone. When the second wave reached the location of the shallow convection, deep convection was immediately initiated. Further convective cells developed later in the afternoon over dry soil, many adjacent to strong soil moisture gradients; these aggregated with the main storm, which later developed into the case study MCS. A comparison of model simulations with/without the soil-moisture heterogeneity and gravity waves shows that the synoptic-scale circulation and convergence zones, specified by the atmospheric analysis, were the most important factors for the successful simulation of the MCS. If the location of the initiation of the system is to be forecast accurately, the land-surface, that is, the soil moisture, must be represented adequately. In order to reproduce the timing of the secondary initiation of convection correctly the model must be able to capture gravity waves that are emitted by existing systems.},

The forecasts of surface variables, anomaly correlations of isobar heights, and precipitation forecast skills of the GFS with and without the soil moisture data assimilation are assessed. The surface and deep layer soil moisture estimates of the GFS after the satellite soil moisture assimilation are found to have slightly better agreement with the ground soil moisture measurements at dozens of sites across the continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts of surface humidity and air temperature, 500 hPa height anomaly correlations, and the precipitation forecast skill demonstrated certain level of improvements after the soil moisture assimilation against those without the soil moisture assimilation.

Microplots received 0, 2000, 5000, 8000, 12,000 or 15,000 kg ha(-1) of cereal rye shoot biomass, and were injected with two mg N-15 kg(-1) soil 5 cm below the soil surface. Pigweeds were sown and allowed to germinate. Results Maximum rates of cereal rye shoot decomposition were observed at {\textgreater}= 5000 kg ha(-1). Although cereal rye shoot N declined, shoots became enriched with N-15, indicating fungal transfer of soil N to shoots. Soil inorganic N declined by an average of 5 kg N ha(-1). Pigweed tissue N and biomass were reduced in the presence of cereal rye. The magnitude of pigweed N reduction was similar across all shoot application rates.

However, it remains largely unknown about the consequence of intensified agricultural activity on microbial N transformation in agricultural soils. In this study, the N-15-dilution technique was carried out to investigate the gross mineralization and nitrification in soils from a long-term field fertilization experiment starting from 1988. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis was used to determine soil microbial communities, e.g., biomasses of anaerobic bacterial, bacterial, fungi, and actinobacteria. The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results have demonstrated significant stimulation of gross mineralization in the chemical-fertilizers treatment (NPK) ([6.53 +/- 1.29] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) and chemical fertilizersplusstraw treatment (NPK+S1) soils ([8.13 +/- 1.68] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) but not in chemical fertilizersplustwo times straw treatment (NPK+S2) soil when compared to the control-treatment (CK) soil ([3.62 +/- 0.86] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)). The increase of anaerobic bacterial biomass is up to 6-fold in the NPK+S2 compared to that in the CK soil ([0.7 +/- 0.5] nmol g(-1)), implying that exceptionally high abundance of anaerobic bacteria may inhibit gross mineralization to some extent. The gross nitrification shows upward trends in the NPK+S1 and NPK+S2 soils. However, it is only significantly higher in the NPK soil ([5.56 +/- 0.51] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) compared to that in the CK soil ([3.70 +/- 0.47] mg N kg(-1) d(-1)) (p {\textless} 0.05). The AOB abundance increased from (0.28 +/- 0.07) x 10(6) copies (g soil)1 for the CK treatment to (4.79 +/- 1.23) x 10(6) copies (g soil)(-1) for the NPK treatment after the 22-year fertilization. In contrast, the AOA abundance was not significantly different among all treatment soils. The changes of AOB were well paralleled by gross nitrification activity (gross nitrification rate = 0.263 AOB + 0.047 NH4+-N + 2.434, R-2 = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting the predominance of bacterial ammonia oxidation in the fertilized fields.},

Furthermore, to fully capture the hydrologic effects of nonuniform precipitation, a representation of soil moisture heterogeneity and distribution of spatially varying precipitation must exist within the same framework. For this study, the explicit and sampling methods of Sellers et al. (2007) are tested off-line using the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB3) in an arid, semiarid, and wet site, and are numerically compared to the bulk method, which is currently used in GCMs. To carry out the numerical experiments, an arbitrary grid area was defined by (1) a single instance of SiB3 (bulk method), (2) 100 instances of SiB3 (explicit method), and (3) less than 100 instances of SiB3 (sampling method). Precipitation was randomly distributed over fractions of the grid area for the explicit and sampling methods, while the standard SiB3 exponential distribution relating precipitation intensity to the grid area wet fraction was used in the bulk method. Comparing the sampling and bulk method to the explicit method indicates that 10 instances of SiB3 in the sampling method better captures the spatial variability in soil moisture and grid area flux calculations produced by the explicit method, and deals realistically with spatially varying precipitation at little additional computational cost to the bulk method.},

	abstract = {In order to investigate the sensitivity of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) to soil moisture inhomogeneities in West Africa, convection-permitting simulations with the COSMO model are performed. Three scenarios are investigated in detail: a homogeneous soil texture and soil moisture distribution and a homogeneous soil texture field with a north-south oriented band of two degrees width with reduced and increased soil moisture, respectively. In all experiments an MCS develops in the late afternoon some hundred kilometres east of the band with modified soil moisture. About 100 km east of the band, significant differences in precipitation occur: when the MCS approaches the band with lower soil moisture, precipitation decreases because of higher convective inhibition (CIN) and higher saturation deficit above the lifting condensation level ahead of the band. Reaching the dry band, precipitation restarts. The moist band causes an increase of precipitation ahead of the band and a decrease over it due to very high CIN and saturation deficit values above the boundary layer. In both cases, the soil moisture patterns induce a secondary circulation which modifies the conditions in the lower troposphere. These altered conditions are responsible for the changes of the convection-related parameters and for the modification of the MCS. Additionally, the dry band causes the evolution of precipitating cells over its western part in the late afternoon. The cells are triggered by superimposed convergences, one generated by the thermally-forced circulation of the dry band and the other one caused by different boundary-layer depths over the dry band and its surroundings. The very deep boundary layer over the dry band is accompanied by downward mixing of momentum from the African Easterly Jet, resulting in a reduced westerly monsoon flow so that convergence and divergence zones develop at the transitions from the deeper to the lower boundary layers.

To reduce errors caused by uncertainties of system parameters, the LDAS uses a dual-pass assimilation algorithm, with a calibration pass to estimate major model parameters from satellite data and an assimilation pass to estimate the near-surface soil moisture. Validation data of soil moisture were collected in a Mongolian semiarid region. Results show that (i) the LDAS-estimated soil moistures are comparable to areal averages of in situ measurements, though the measured soil moistures were highly variable from site to site; (ii) the LSM-simulated soil moistures show less biases when the LSM uses LDAS-calibrated parameter values instead of default parameter values, indicating that the satellite-based calibration does contribute to soil moisture estimations; and (iii) compared to the LSM, the LDAS produces more robust and reliable soil moisture when forcing data become worse. The lower sensitivity of the LDAS output to precipitation is particularly encouraging for applying this system to regions where precipitation data are prone to errors.},

	abstract = {As a crucial parameter in land surface systems, soil moisture plays an important role in surface energy balance studies, environmental detection, and global climate change research. Remotely sensed data have been used for estimating soil moisture through different approaches, which has resulted in many achievements. Previous studies showed that the land surface temperature (LST) vegetation index method (LST-VI method) can obtain surface soil moisture with remote sensing sources, and it is relatively simple and easy to operate at a regional scale. However, one thorny difficulty is the dry edge determination from the LST-VI feature space. In this study, a remote sensing method is proposed to determine the theoretical dry edge from the LST-VI scatter plots, which do not require any ground measured auxiliary data. Based on the surface energy balance principle, this method derived the maximum LSTs for bare soil and full vegetation cover using MODIS products. The air temperature is parameterized by the LST using a semiempirical formula as the theoretical wet edge. The estimated soil moisture is validated by in situ measurements at a comprehensive weather station of Yucheng. The coefficient of determination is similar to 0.60, and the root mean square error is about 0.08 m(3)/m(3). The relevant key parameters in determining the dry edge are also validated from the meteorological observation. The air temperature and net surface shortwave radiation flux all reach a very high level, with an RMSE of 3.75 k and 49.3 W m(-2), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can derive the accurate dry edge to estimate soil moisture from the remote sensing data, which will provide great help for future studies of soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques.

The Chesapeake Bay watershed model (WSM) has been used for two decades to simulate hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport; however, spatial limitations of the WSM preclude edge-of-field scale representation of phosphorus (P) losses. Rather, the WSM relies on literature-derived, county-scale rates of P loss (targets) for simulated land uses. An independent field-scale modeling tool, Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE), was used as an alternative to the current WSM approach. Identical assumptions of county-level acreage, soil properties, nutrient management practices, and transport factors from the WSM were used as inputs to APLE. Incorporation of APLE P-loss estimates resulted in greater estimated total P loss and a revised spatial pattern of P loss compared with the WSM's original targets. Subsequently, APLE's revised estimates for P loss were substituted into the WSM and resulted in improved WSM calibration performance at up to 79\% of tributary monitoring stations. The incorporation of APLE into the WSM will improve its ability to assess P loss and the impact of field management on Chesapeake Bay water quality.},

	abstract = {[1] Soil moisture is a very important variable in land surface processes. Both field moisture measurements and estimates from modeling have their limitations when being used to estimate soil moisture on a large spatial scale. Remote sensing is becoming a practical method to estimate soil moisture globally; however, the quality of current soil surface moisture products needs to be improved in order to meet practical requirements. Data assimilation (DA) is a promising approach to merge model dynamics and remote sensing observations, thus having the potential to estimate soil moisture more accurately. In this study, a data assimilation algorithm, which couples the particle filter and the kernel smoothing technique, is presented to estimate soil moisture and soil parameters from microwave signals. A simple hydrological model with a daily time step is utilized to reduce the computational burden in the process of data assimilation. An observation operator based on the ratio of two microwave brightness temperatures at different frequencies is designed to link surface soil moisture with remote sensing measurements, and a sensitivity analysis of this operator is also conducted. Additionally, a variant of particle filtering method is developed for the joint estimation of soil moisture and soil parameters such as texture and porosity. This assimilation scheme is validated against field moisture measurements at the CEOP/Mongolia experiment site and is found to estimate near-surface soil moisture very well. The retrieved soil texture still contains large uncertainties as the retrieved values cannot converge to fixed points or narrow ranges when using different initial soil texture values, but the retrieved soil porosity has relatively small uncertainties.},

	abstract = {Pixel-based effective soil hydraulic parameters are crucial inputs for large-scale hydroclimatic modeling. In this paper, we extend/apply a genetic algorithm (GA) approach for estimating these parameters at the scale of an airborne remote sensing (RS) footprint. To estimate these parameters, we used a time series of near-surface RS soil moisture data to invert a physically based soil-water-atmosphere-plant (SWAP) model with a (multipopulated) modified-microGA. Uncertainties in the solutions were examined in two ways: (1) by solving the inverse problem under various combinations of modeling conditions in a respective way; and (2) the same as the first method but the inverse solutions were determined in a collective way aimed at finding the robust solutions for all the modeling conditions (ensembles). A cross validation of the derived soil hydraulic parameters was done to check their effectiveness for all the modeling conditions used. For our case studies, we considered three electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) footprints in Oklahoma and four polarimetric scanning radiometer (PSR) footprints in Iowa during the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology Experiment and Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) campaigns, respectively. The results clearly showed the promising potentials of near-surface RS soil moisture data combined with inverse modeling for determining average soil hydrologic properties at the footprint scale. Our cross validation showed that parameters derived by method 1 under water table (bottom boundary) conditions are applicable also for free-draining conditions. However, parameters derived under free-draining conditions generally produced too wet near-surface soil moisture when applied under water table conditions. Method 2, on the other hand, produced robust parameter sets applicable for all modeling conditions used. These results were validated using distributed in situ soil moisture and soil hydraulic properties measurements, and texture-based data from the UNSODA database. In this study, we conclude that inverse modeling of RS soil moisture data is a promising approach for parameter estimation at large measurement support scale. Nevertheless, the derived effective soil hydraulic parameters are subject to the uncertainties of remotely sensed soil moisture data and from the assumptions used in the soil-water-atmosphere-plant modeling. Method 2 provides a flexible framework for accounting these sources of uncertainties in the inverse estimation of large-scale soil hydraulic properties. We have illustrated this flexibility by combining multiple data sources and various modeling conditions in our large-scale inverse modeling.},

The field experiment was conducted in 2001 and 2002, including two treatments: lowland-rice variety (Oryza sativa L. spp. Japonica) grown under thin (14 gm) plastic-film soil cover (GCRPS(plastic)) at 80\%-90\% water-holding capacity (WHC) and traditional lowland rice (paddy control) grown with 3cm standing-water table. The pot experiment was conducted in a greenhouse with four treatments: (1) traditional lowland rice: paddy control; (2) GCRPS, water-saturated soil: GCRPS(saturated); (3) GCRPS at 90\% water-holding capacity (WHC): GCRPS(90\%WHC); and (4) GCRPS at 70\% WHC: GCRPS(70\%WHC). Results of the field experiment showed that dry-matter production, number of tillers, as well as N and Mn concentrations in rice shoots of GCRPS were significantly lower than in paddy control, while there was no significant difference in shoot Fe, Cu, Zn, and P concentration and nematode populations. In the pot experiment, shoot Mn concentration significantly decreased with decreasing soil water content, while soil redox potential increased. Shoot-dry matter production and tiller number of GCRPSsaturated were significantly higher than in other treatments. Significant correlations were observed between the shoot Mn concentration and tiller number at maximum tillering stage in the field and pot experiment, respectively. We therefore conclude that the limitation of Mn acquisition might contribute to the growth and yield reduction of lowland rice grown in GCRPS. The experiment provides evidence that GCRPSplastic combined with nearly water-saturated soil conditions helps saving water and achieving optimum crop development without visual or latent Mn deficiency as observed under more aerobic conditions.},

	abstract = {Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA), as an approach, has been developed for the measurement of soil dielectric constants. As it stands, the standard dielectric of dry soil is much less than the dielectric of soil exposed to water, and the volume of water present significantly affects the propagation of electromagnetic waves. With this in mind, this paper proposes a plan for the design and implementation of two distinct isolated probe structures for the measurement of water contents within the soil at different levels. Accordingly, Probe A is used to determine the water level present in soil at four different depths. Probe A does this by utilizing pairs of parabolic copper sections fixed horizontally and isolated over the outer surface of an access tube. Probe B, on the other hand, makes use of two steel rings buried vertically inside of an access tube, and is used to determine the water contents of soil on two levels. To do so, a fixed frequency square-wave is transmitted to measure the soil capacitance in which the probe sensors are connected to an Arduino microcontroller which also included air humidity, air temperature, and soil temperature sensors. During the experimental assessment of both probes, the results are loaded onto an SD memory card and are then compared with the results of other commercial sensors installed in the same irrigated plot. The soil moisture monitoring station used is powered by a photovoltaic (PV) module of 10 W 12 V and a storage battery of 12 Ah. The experimental monitoring station used to assess the efficiency of both probe designs was set up in a Mediterranean semiarid zone in the Southeast of Spain.},

	abstract = {Monitoring and estimating grid-mean soil moisture is very important for assessing many hydrological, biological, and biogeochemical processes and for validating remotely sensed surface soil moisture products. Temporal stability analysis (TSA) is a valuable tool for identifying a small number of representative sampling points to estimate the grid-mean soil moisture content. This analysis was evaluated and improved using high-quality surface soil moisture data that were acquired by a wireless sensor network in a high-intensity irrigated agricultural landscape in an arid region of northwestern China. The performance of the TSA was limited in areas where the representative error was dominated by random events, such as irrigation events. This shortcoming can be effectively mitigated by using a stratified TSA (STSA) method, proposed in this paper. In addition, the following methods were proposed for rapidly and efficiently identifying representative sampling points when using TSA. (1) Instantaneous measurements can be used to identify representative sampling points to some extent; however, the error resulting from this method is significant when validating remotely sensed soil moisture products. Thus, additional representative sampling points should be considered to reduce this error. (2) The calibration period can be determined from the time span of the full range of the grid-mean soil moisture content during the monitoring period. (3) The representative error is sensitive to the number of calibration sampling points, especially when only a few representative sampling points are used. Multiple sampling points are recommended to reduce data loss and improve the likelihood of representativeness at two scales.},

The analysis was carried out by comparing the satellite-derived indices with the previous normal years, and the assessments were made. The satellite-based indices clearly brought out the stress that the crop endured during late October and November, while SMI indicated soil water stress in early October. The soiland crop-specific SMI's were able to clearly indicate the exact period of water stress.

The study was conducted near Pana, IL, between 2002 and 2006. Soil compaction was evaluated indirectly by measuring soil penetration resistance (PR) and surface CO2 effluxes. Total soil C, N, and microbial biomass C, were measured from 2002 to 2005. Soil PR and CO2 effluxes showed inconsistent trends related to soil compaction and cattle presence. Corn yield from 2004 to 2006 was higher (P = 0.01) in the integrated system (11.6 Mg ha(-1)) compared with continuous corn (10.6 Mg ha(-1)). Total soil C concentration increased significantly from 2002 to 2005 within components of the integrated system but remained unchanged in continuous corn. Microbial biomass C was also higher in the integrated system but only in 2005.

	abstract = {The primary productivity of terrestrial ecosystems is influenced by soil phosphorus bioavailability, which depends largely on chemical fractions of phosphorus. The sequential fractionation technique developed by Hedley et al. or its subsequent modification is a well-known method to determine soil phosphorus forms. Hedley sequential fractionation technique separates the phosphorus into fractions based on their different chemical solubilities in extractants with certain chemical properties. Recently, synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy has been employed to measure soil phosphorus species directly and non-invasively. The XANES method provides information concerning local structure and chemical information of target elements at a molecular level. Thus, it can distinguish phosphorus fractions bound by metal oxides or hydroxides (such as Fe, Al, and Ca). In this present work, the phosphorus speciation of topsoil along a glacial foreland chronosequence in Gongga Mountain is determined using these two methods. The changes in soil phosphorus bioavailability along the 120-year-old chronosequence are assessed based on comparisons of the results obtained by these two methods. The results indicate that Hedley sequential fractionation technique shows a greater ability to determine soil bioavailable phosphorus (Resin-P and NaCHO3-P), while XANES is effective in distinguishing phosphorus bound by metal compounds. In the chronosequence, Ca- and Al-bound phosphorus were derived mainly from primary minerals, whose phosphorus contents decreased within 120 years of moraine weathering and soil development. The content of soil bioavailable phosphorus increased rapidly after 30 years since deglaciation. The increasing phosphorus bioavailability promoted the colonizing and primary succession vegetation.},

The residual effect on wheat yield was more pronounced. Soil pH in post harvest rice soil increased with the application of sludge, however, it decreased in post harvest wheat soil at higher levels of sludge application. Increase in available nutrients content of soil was also recorded with increasing levels of sludge application after harvest of rice and wheat crops. Application of sludge also increased the heavy metals contents in soil and plant. The Cd content in rice grain was above the Indian safe limit at 20 t ha(-1) or higher levels of sludge application.

For the study domain of Oklahoma, LDAS soil moisture estimates improve over the satellite retrievals and the open-loop (no assimilation) land surface model estimates, exhibiting higher daily anomaly correlation coefficients (e.g., 0.36 in the open loop, 0.38 in the AMSR-E, and 0.50 in LDAS for surface soil moisture). The LDAS soil moisture estimates also match the performance of a benchmark model simulation forced with high-quality radar precipitation.

	abstract = {A field study was conducted during 2003-2005 to compare the relative efficacy of three mulches (viz. rice straw, subabul leaf and weeds) and quantities (6, 8 and 10 tonnes/ha) on soil moisture retention and productivity of rainfed ginger in a gamari based agroforestry system in Mizoram. Soil moisture conservation was significantly (P = 0.05) affected by mulch type and quantity of mulch applied. Soil moisture retention in the plots was in the order of rice straw{\textgreater}subabul leaf{\textgreater}weeds and 10 t/ha {\textgreater}8 t/ha {\textgreater}6 t/ha mulch applied. The number of sprout, sprout frequency, tiller height and finger size of ginger were better in the mulched plots when compared with the unmulched (control) plots. Ginger yield in the mulched plots was in the order of subabul leaf{\textgreater}rice straw{\textgreater}weeds. The slower decomposition of rice straw caused greater moisture retention while quick decomposition of subabul leaf caused increased addition of nitrogen to the soil thereby increased ginger yield. Our study depicts the favourable role played by the mulches in soil conservation in the hilly terrain of Mizoram. Further, the study demonstrates that the common weeds can be effectively used in conserving soil moisture and improving crop productivity.},

	abstract = {Harvesting Miscanthus x giganteus (J.M. Greef \& Deuter ex Hodkinson \& Renvoize) after shoot emergence is known to reduce yields in subsequent seasons. This research was conducted in Miscanthus to assess the effects on crop response and soil compaction of annually repeated traffic, applied both before new growth in the rhizomes (early harvest) and after shoot emergence (late harvest), at two different soil moisture contents. While an annual early harvest, yields more than a late harvest, because damage to new shoots is avoided, soil compaction may be increased following repeated harvests. Five treatments were tested: (a) An untrafficked control, (b) early-traffic on soil with typical soil moisture content (SMC) (early-normal), (c) early-traffic on soil with elevated SMC (early-elevated), (d) late-traffic on soil with typical SMC (late-normal) and (e) late-traffic on soil with elevated SMC (late-wet). The experiment was conducted on a Gleysol in Co. Dublin, Ireland during 2010 and 2011. Crop response effects were assessed by measuring stem numbers, stem height, trafficked zone biomass yield (November) and overall stem yield (January). Compaction effects were assessed by measuring penetration resistance, bulk density and water infiltration rate. Trafficked zone biomass yield in the early-dry and early-wet treatments was, respectively, 18\% and 23\% lower than in the control, but was, respectively, 39\% and 31\% higher than in the late-dry treatment. Overall, stem yield was significantly lower in the late-normal and late-wet treatments (10.4 and 10.1 tdm ha(-1) respectively) when compared with the control (12.4 tdm ha(-1)), but no significant difference was recorded in overall stem yield between both early-traffic treatments and the control. Penetration resistance values were significantly higher in all trafficked treatments when compared with the control at depths of 0.15 m (54-61\%) and 0.30 m (27-57\%) and were significantly higher in 2011 when compared with 2010 at depths of 0.15 and 0.30 m. Baler system traffic in Miscanthus significantly reduced yields and significantly increased compaction annually. Miscanthus harvested early, on a dry soil, yielded 1.1 tdm ha(-1) more than when harvested late on a dry soil. The yield advantage increased to 1.3 tdm ha(-1) when early harvesting on a soil with 40-43\% moisture content was compared with late harvesting on a wetter soil (51-52\% moisture content). In this study, the magnitude of yield losses from compaction or other causes in early harvests was substantially lower than the yield losses, which resulted from shoot damage in late harvests. It is likely in similar climates that the results of this study would also apply to other perennial crops growing in similar soil types.},

	abstract = {Field experiments were conducted during 2007-2009 to study the effect of deficit irrigation practices through drip irrigation system on soil moisture distribution and root growth in cotton-maize cropping sequence. Creation of soil moisture gradient is indispensable to explore the beneficial effects of partial root zone drying (PRD) irrigation and it could be possible only through ADI practice in paired row system of drip layout, that is commonly practiced in India. In the present study, PRD and deficit irrigation (DI) concepts (creation of soil moisture gradient) were implemented through alternate deficit irrigation (ADI) at two levels of irrigation using drip system. Experimental treatments comprised of six irrigation levels (full and deficit) through drip system with surface irrigation for comparison. Maize was sown after cotton under no till condition without disturbing the raised bed and drip layout. Roots confined to the shallow depth and recorded the lowest values for both the crops under conventional drip irrigation at 100\% ETc. Among the deficit irrigation treatments, mild deficit irrigation produced longer lateral roots from both the sides of the plant. Contrary to rooting depth, severe water stress affected the lateral root spread and recorded lower values than other drip irrigation treatments. Soil moisture content (SMC) was low nearer to the plant (at 30 cm across the lateral) and far away (at 30 cm along the lateral) from the plant, irrespective of treatments. The reduction in SMC was increased at all locations as applied water level decreased. It is concluded that alternate watering imposed through ADI at 100\% ETc produced longer lateral roots with higher values for root dry mass Alternate deficit irrigation (ADI) resulted uneven distribution of soil moisture content. Among the ADI treatments, ADI at 100\% had less uneven distribution than ADI at 80\% ETc. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

This is why this research examines the factors that are related to the use of indigenous knowledge on fallow practices by small-scale food crop farmers in Iseyin Local Government Area of Oyo State. The findings show that majority of the farmers were above 40 years with no formal education and still practice indigenous fallow system despite their contact with extension agents. It was also found that the use of Indigenous Knowledge on fallow practices have strong relationship with fanner's age, educational level, social participation, contact with extension and sources of information. These variables however could explain 58 per cent of the variation in indigenous knowledge use on fallow practices adopted respectively by farmers. Significant determinants were age (t = 1.61), gender (t = 2.65), household size (t = 2.06), marital status (t = 1.65), social participation (t = 2.82), farm size (t = 1.89), farming experience (t = 2.65) and income (t = 1.73).

The level of soil fertility was also tested with or without incorporation of mung bean residue. The interaction of phosphorus to mungbean residue incorporation was thus studied in relation to improve crop productivity with balancing fertilizer requirements through an eco-friendly approach. Sorghum grain yield increased significantly when 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1) was applied and mungbean residue incorporated. The response was reduced to 30 kg P2O5 ha(-1) when mungbean residue was not incorporated. The succeeding lentil crop responded up to 60 kg P2O5 ha(-1) only when preceding sorghum crop received 0 or 30 kg P2O5 ha(-1).

Global drought events and their duration, frequency and severity are assessed on a grid basis with soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI). The results show that the ESA CCI SM and the GLDAS-Noah based SMAPI values are significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) correlated over most (83\%) of the study region, of seasonally dependent. Both datasets show similar global patterns in drought duration, drought frequency and drought severity. The droughts present generally longer duration, higher frequency and more severity in arid and semi-arid regions than humid and sub-humid regions. The ESA CCI SM droughts are relatively higher in frequency and more intense in severity than the GLDAS-Noah SM droughts in many regions of the globe, while the two datasets show considerable differences in drought duration over arid, semi-arid and highly vegetated regions. For long-term trend detection, both datasets show high consistency in spatial pattern of SMAPI, with major significant drying trends in arid and semi-arid regions. Part (similar to 20\%) trends are confirmed by the Global Precipitation Climatology Centre (GPCC) precipitation dataset using the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI). The two SM datasets exhibit large disparity in trending drought duration, drought frequency and drought severity. Despite that, both show major significant increasing trends in arid and semi-arid regions. Both soil moisture datasets are capable of identifying extreme drought events reported in southern China, North America, Europe and southern Africa. The ESA CCI SM dataset is more effective in determining the severity and spatial pattern of drought excluding densely vegetated regions, while the GLDAS-Noah dataset is more powerful in detecting drought occurrence, even over densely vegetated regions. Overall, the ESA CCI SM and GLDAS-Noah SM show potential in global drought analysis, yet cautions should be paid to arid and semi-arid regions where drying trends are prevalent and large discrepancy presents between two datasets.},

Specifically, the study contrasts a multidimensional satellite rainfall error model (SREM2D) to a simpler rainfall error model (CTRL) currently used to generate rainfall ensembles as part of the ensemble-based land data assimilation system developed at the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office. The study is conducted in the Oklahoma region using rainfall data from a NOAA multisatellite global rainfall product [the Climate Prediction Center (CPC) morphing technique (CMORPH)] and the National Weather Service rain gauge-calibrated radar rainfall product [Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D)] representing the “uncertain” and “reference” model rainfall forcing, respectively. Soil moisture simulations using the Catchment land surface model (CLSM), obtained by forcing the model with reference rainfall, are randomly perturbed to represent satellite retrieval uncertainty, and assimilated into CLSM as synthetic near-surface soil moisture observations. The assimilation estimates show improved performance metrics, exhibiting higher anomaly correlation coefficients (e.g., similar to 0.79 and similar to 0.90 in the SREM2D nonassimilation and assimilation experiments for root zone soil moisture, respectively) and lower root-mean-square errors (e.g., similar to 0.034 m(3) m(-3) and similar to 0.024 m(3) m(-3) in the SREM2D nonassimilation and assimilation experiments for root zone soil moisture, respectively). The more elaborate rainfall error model in the assimilation system leads to slightly improved assimilation estimates. In particular, the relative enhancement due to SREM2D over CTRL is larger for root zone soil moisture and in wetter rainfall conditions.},

Both soils from the central highlands of Mexico were characterized and incubated aerobically at 5\% field capacity (5\%FC) and 100\% field capacity (FC) for 45 days, while the C and N mineralization, enzyme activity and the bacterial community structure were monitored. After applying the different agricultural practices 3 years, the organic C content was 1.8-times larger in the milpa than in the conventional cultivated soil, the microbial biomass C 1.3-times, and C and N mineralization 2.0-times (mean for soil incubated at 5\%FC and FC). The dehydrogenase, activity was significantly higher in the conventional cultivated soil than in the milpa soil when incubated at 5\%FC, but not when incubated at FC. The relative abundance of Gemmatimonadetes was larger in the conventional cultivated soil than in the milpa soil in soil both at 5\%FC and FC, while that of Bacteroidetes showed an opposite trend. The relative abundance of other groups, such as Nitrospirae and Proteobacteria, was affected by cultivation technique, but controlled by soil water content. The relative abundance of other groups, e.g., FBP, Gemmatimonadetes and Proteobacteria, was affected by water content, but the effect depended on agricultural practice. For soil incubated at FC, the xenobiotics biodegradation and metabolism related functions were higher in the milpa soil than in the conventional cultivated soil, and carbohydrate metabolism showed an opposite trend. It was found that agricultural practices and soil water content had a strong effect on soil characteristics, C and N mineralization, enzyme activity, and the bacterial community structure and its functionality. Decreases or increases in the relative abundance of bacterial groups when the soil water content decreased, i.e., from FC to 5\%FC, was defined often by the cultivation technique, and the larger organic matter content in the milpa soil did not prevent large changes in the bacterial community structure when the soil was dried.},

	abstract = {Debris flows represent frequent hazards in mountain regions. Though significant effort has been made to predict such events, the trigger conditions as well as the hydrologic disposition of a watershed at the time of debris flow occurrence are not well understood. Traditional intensity-duration threshold techniques to establish trigger conditions generally do not account for distinct influences of rainfall, snowmelt, and antecedent moisture. To improve our knowledge on the connection between debris flow initiation and the hydrologic system at a regional scale, this study explores the use of a semi-distributed conceptual rainfall-runoff model, linking different system variables such as soil moisture, snowmelt, or runoff with documented debris flow events in the inner Pitztal watershed, Austria. The model was run on a daily basis between 1953 and 2012. Analysing a range of modelled system state and flux variables at days on which debris flows occurred, three distinct dominant trigger mechanisms could be clearly identified. While the results suggest that for 68\%(17 out of 25) of the observed debris flow events during the study period high-intensity rainfall was the dominant trigger, snowmelt was identified as the dominant trigger for 24\% (6 out of 25) of the observed debris flow events. In addition, 8\% (2 out of 25) of the debris flow events could be attributed to the combined effects of low-intensity, long-lasting rainfall and transient storage of this water, causing elevated antecedent soil moisture conditions. The results also suggest a relatively clear temporal separation between the distinct trigger mechanisms, with high-intensity rainfall as a trigger being limited to mid-and late summer. The dominant trigger in late spring/early summer is snowmelt. Based on the discrimination between different modelled system states and fluxes and, more specifically, their temporally varying importance relative to each other, this exploratory study demonstrates that already the use of a relatively simple hydrological model can prove useful to gain some more insight into the importance of distinct debris flow trigger mechanisms. This highlights in particular the relevance of snowmelt contributions and the switch between mechanisms during early to mid-summer in snow-dominated systems.},

Models for predicting N-mineralization contributions are needed, and development of these models will require field-based data. In situ mineralization methods are intended to quantify N mineralization under ambient environmental conditions. This study was conducted to compare soil moisture and temperature in intact soil cores contained in cylinders to those in adjacent bulk soil, compare the effect of two resin-bag techniques on water content of soil within cylinders, and assess the effect of installation duration on inorganic N retention by resins. The study was conducted at a dryland conventionally tilled corn (Zea mays L.) site and an irrigated no-tillage corn site in eastern Nebraska. Soil in cylinders was slightly wetter ({\textless}0.05 g g(-1)) and warmer ({\textless}1 degrees C) than adjacent soil. Soil water content was, {\textless}80\% water-filled pore space (WFPS) at all sampling times and differed little between the two resin-bag techniques. Greater soil water content and temperature conditions (though small) observed during most of the study period likely enhanced N mineralization within the cylinder compared to N mineralization in adjacent bulk soil, but the magnitude is likely much less than core-to-core variation normally observed in a field. Installing cylinders for more than 60 days resulted in loss of inorganic N from resins. Care is needed during installation to ensure that compaction of soil below the cylinder does not impede water movement through the intact soil core. The in situ method utilizing intact soil cores and resin bags replaced at 28- to 40-day intervals is a viable method for measuring N mineralization.},

	abstract = {Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture, but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and thermal remote-sensing images [e.g. using the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3 years. In situ soil moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability in degree of saturation for this region.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a vital parameter in various land surface processes, and microwave remote sensing is widely used to estimate regional soil moisture. However, the application of the retrieved soil moisture data is restricted by its coarse spatial resolution. To overcome this weakness, many methods were proposed to downscale microwave soil moisture data. The traditional method is the microwave-optical/IR synergistic approach, in which land surface temperature (LST), vegetation index and surface albedo are key parameters. However, due to the uncertainty in absolute LST estimation, this approach is partly dependent on the accuracy of LST estimation. To eliminate the impacts of LST estimation, an improved downscaling method is proposed in this study to downscale Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer on the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture product with visible and thermal data of Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)-Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI). Two temperature temporal variation parameters related to soil moisture, including mid-morning rising rate and daily maximum temperature time, are introduced in the proposed method to replace LST. The proposed method and the traditional method are both applied to the Iberian Peninsula area for July and August 2007. Comparison of the two results shows that the coefficient of determination (R-squared) has an average improvement of 0.08 and the root mean square error has a systematic decrease. The downscaled soil moisture by the proposed method was validated by REMEDHUS soil moisture network in the study area, and site specific validation gets poor correlation between the two datasets because of the low spatial representativeness of site measurement for one MSG-SEVIRI pixel. Although the comparisons at 15 km and network scale show an improvement over the site specific comparison, it is found that the downscaling method systematically degrades the accuracy in soil moisture data, with a R-squared of 0-0.4 and 0.218 for the downscaled data set against 0.7-0.8 and 0.571 for AMSR-E data at 15 km scale and the network scale respectively.},

	abstract = {Earth Observation (EO) provides a promising approach towards deriving accurate spatiotemporal estimates of key parameters characterizing land surface interactions, such as latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes as well as soil moisture content. This paper proposes a very simple method to implement, yet reliable to calculate evapotranspiration fraction (EF) and surface moisture availability (M-o) from remotely sensed imagery of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and surface radiometric temperature (T-ir). The method is unique in that it derives all of its information solely from these two images. As such, it does not depend on knowing ancillary surface or atmospheric parameters, nor does it require the use of a land surface model. The procedure for computing spatiotemporal estimates of these important land surface parameters is outlined herein stepwise for practical application by the user. Moreover, as the newly developed scheme is not tied to any particular sensor, it can also be implemented with technologically advanced EO sensors launched recently or planned to be launched such as Landsat 8 and Sentinel 3. The latter offers a number of key advantages in terms of future implementation of the method and wider use for research and practical applications alike.},

	abstract = {Ditch-buried straw return (DBSR) is a novel farming system that not only efficiently eliminates the need to burn straw, but also shows positive effects on soil carbon sequestration and crop yields. Implementation of DBSR, however, may penetrate the tillage pan, increasing the risk of N leaching losses. We therefore determined whether N retention could be increased by DBSR in order to reduce the risk of N loss to the environment. A four-year field experiment and a complementary greenhouse experiment were conducted to test the effects of DBSR on N retention in a rice-wheat rotation system. We found that DBSR altered the spatial distribution of fertilizer N. N content was significantly increased above but reduced below the straw layer in the field experiment. The greenhouse experiment further confirmed the N retention effects by the straw layer. In theory, a maximum of 9.09 mg urea-N could be adsorbed by one gram dry wheat straw. Our results suggest that DBSR has the potential to increase N retention in the soil, thus increasing crop uptake and minimizing leaching N loss in the rice-wheat rotation system.

Therefore, this study was carried out on a 30 hm(2) potato field located 650 km south of Riyadh, the capital city of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, to investigate the impacts of the center pivot irrigation distribution uniformity on the crop development and the spatial distribution of residual soil N. Irrigation performance test was designed to investigate water application rate and distribution uniformities. The overall water application uniformity coefficients (Cu), determined through Christiansen (Cud) and Heerman (CuH) methods, were determined at 81.29\% and 80.64\%, respectively. However, the overall water distribution uniformity (Du) was determined at 70\%. A considerable variability in the distribution uniformity of irrigation water was observed across the experimental field (a Du value of 67\% over the medium spans compared to a Du value of 88\% over the inner spans). Results of this study showed a linear correlation between the irrigation water distribution uniformity and the soil N (R-2=0.88). On the other hand, the vegetation cover distribution, indicated by the Cumulative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (CNDVI), was not found to be much responsive to the irrigation distribution uniformity (R-2=0.11). A time series of successive NDVI maps extracted throughout the potato crop growth stages showed a consistent trend in the distribution of NDVI across the field, with R 2 values that ranged between 0.25-0.73.},

	abstract = {Leguminous tree species are known to replenish soil nutrients through biological N fixation, mulch effect and recycling of other nutrients from the deeper soil layer to the topsoil, when managed in agroforestry systems. The soil available phosphorus (P) status and inorganic P-forms (fractionation) in a long-term gliricidia-maize trial was studied to understand the effect of additions of gliricidia prunings combined with and without inorganic fertilizers (N and P). Addition of gliricidia prunings and inorganic N and P fertilizers significantly increased phosphorus uptake by maize. Bray P1 had strong correlation with P uptake by maize in gliricidia/maize intercropping (r = 0.81, p {\textless} 0.001). Both the Olsen and Bray P1 methods of extraction were strongly correlated (r = 0.80). Phosphorus fractionation data of the soils from the maize and gliricidia-maize plots indicated that the Fe-P fraction was the most dominant form of inorganic P. The addition of gliricidia prunings significantly reduced the Fe-P and Al-P forms. We conclude that iron phosphate acts as a sink for applied inorganic P in Lixisols and the increased soil organic matter through addition of gliricidia prunings solubilizes fixed P in the soil.},

This task can be suitably performed through various methods; however, at the state of the art, there is not a single method that successfully combines ease of use, low cost, customization, possibility of measuring large volumes, and, most importantly, measurement accuracy. In this regard, seismic wave propagation (SWP)-based methods, which rely on the evaluation of the propagation velocity of a seismic wave v(c) through the soil sample under investigation, hold considerable potential for practical implementation. On such bases, in this work, first the authors propose an enhanced version of a previously developed SWP-based system for soil moisture measurement. Successively, to provide an exhaustive performance characterization of the system, a specific comparative methodology, based on reference time-domain reflectometry (TDR)-based measurements, is addressed. More specifically, SWP- and TDR-based measurements are simultaneously performed on river sand for increasing levels of water content. The TDR-measured moisture levels are taken as reference values and are used to infer the theoretical propagation velocity values v(c), REF. Then, these reference values are suitably compared with those directly measured through the SWP-based system (v(c), MEAS), thus allowing a consistent metrological assessment. The ultimate goal of this work is to validate and characterize the performance of the proposed SWP-based system in view of practical implementation for soil moisture evaluation.},

Excessive soil phosphorus concentrations are an issue, contributing to eutrophication of waterways, while sub-optimal soil pH due to a reduction in lime use is seen in many areas. This paper discusses the potential for introducing technology onto grassland farms, and implementing sensible farm-specific management decisions as a means of enhancing productivity and minimising the environmental impact of livestock fanning. The adoption rate of Precision Agriculture (PA) technology by grassland farmers in the UK and Ireland is still relatively low, and significantly lagging behind the advances that have taken place within the arable farming community. With rapidly advancing technology and investment in research, there are now a range of soil sensors available along with technology for grass growth monitoring, yield mapping, remote sensing, satellite imagery, and devices for tracking animal movement, behaviour and feed intake. In this review paper we examine the latest technology developments specific to grassland farming and we question their suitability and `readiness' for adoption by farmers. The review identifies the challenges that are specific to grassland such as complex soil, vegetation and climatic variables along with economic barriers that may be preventing change within the farming community in these areas.},

	abstract = {As an important component of the Earth's ecosystem, soil moisture plays a vital role in the global water cycle and serves as an important parameter in the study of hydrology, meteorology, and agroecology. Based on the energy balance theory of underlying surface, the atmospheric temperature data recorded by an automatic weather station as well as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-borne thermal infrared and multispectral remote-sensing data were used to establish inversion models of relative soil moisture at different depths based on remote-sensing UAV data and date from near-ground quadrats, respectively. Spatial differences and data accuracy verification were then performed using the 2017 spring wheat moisture data as a control. The results showed that: (1) the relative moisture of farmland soil can be effectively estimated using the proposed soil moisture inversion model. In terrestrial ecosystems, the ratio of actual to potential evapotranspiration, which is often used to characterize potential drought levels, is linearly correlated to soil moisture at different depths; (2) during the inversion of farmland soil moisture, the UAV-based observation method is superior to the near-ground quadrat observation method in both efficiency and accuracy. In addition, the relative soil moisture estimation model based on UAV data has a high accuracy, with R-2 reaching 0.629, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of {\textless}0.100; and (3) the number and size of quadrats are important factors affecting the inversion accuracy. The data collected by the UAVs covered a wide range and had high spatial matching degree at the field scale. Especially, during estimation of the relative moisture of surface soil (0 to 10 and 0 to 20 cm), the linear fitting between the inversion model based on UAV data and the measured value was optimal. The error was minimal (RMSE {\textless}0.07) and R-2 was {\textgreater}0.714, so this method is more suitable for estimating and dynamically monitoring relative soil moisture of farmland at the field scale.

However, the effectiveness of the trailing-shoe technique as a means of reducing P losses has not been evaluated when slurry is applied during periods of high soil moisture levels and lower herbage covers. To address this issue, three treatments were examined in a 3 x 4 factorial design split-plot experiment, with treatments comprising three slurry treatments: control (no slurry), splash-plate and trailing-shoe, and four slurry application dates: 7 December, 18 January, 1 March and 10 April. Dairy cow slurry was applied at a rate of 20 m(3)/ha, while simulated runoff was generated 2, 9 and 16 days later and analysed for a range of P fractions. Dissolved reactive P concentrations in runoff at day two was 41\% lower when slurry was applied using the trailing-shoe technique, compared to the splash-plate technique (P {\textless} 0.05). In addition, P concentrations in runoff were higher (P {\textless} 0.05) from slurry applied in December and March compared to slurry applied in January or April, coinciding with periods of higher soil moisture contents. While the latter highlights that `calendar'-based non-spreading periods might not always achieve the desired consequences, the study demonstrated that further field-scale investigations into the trailing shoe as a mitigation measure to reduced P loss from agricultural soils is warranted.},

This letter demonstrates an extension of the alpha approach by employing the juxtaposition method to adaptively set the soil moisture bounds using the absolute radar backscatter values. This extended alpha method was tested using an airborne time series of L-band SAR data and coincident ground measurements acquired during the SMAPEx-3 experiment over bare agricultural fields. The agreement between estimated and measured soil moisture values was within a rootmean-square error of 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) for each of the three polarization combinations used (i.e., HH, VV, and HH and VV). Moreover, inclusion of the two-polarization combination (HH and VV) slightly improved the retrieval performance. The proposed extension to the alpha method makes the most of the information contained in the SAR data time series by using dynamic, spatially explicit soil moisture bounds retrieved from the SAR data themselves.},

Hyperspectral remote sensing of salinized soil is favored for its advantages of being efficient and inexpensive. However, soil moisture often jointly has a great influence on the soil reflectance spectra under field conditions. It is a challenge to establish a model to eliminate the effect of soil moisture and quantitatively estimate the salinity contents of slightly and moderately salt-affected soil. A controlled laboratory experiment was conducted by way of continuously monitoring changes of soil moisture and salt content, which was mainly focused on the slightly and moderately salt-affected soil. We investigated the external parameter orthogonalization (EPO) method to remove the effect of soil moisture (4 to 36\% in weight base) by preprocessing soil spectral reflectance and establishing the partial least squares regression after EPO preprocessing model (EPO-PLS) to predict soil salt content. Through comparing PLS with EPO-PLS model, R-2 and ratio of prediction to deviation rose from 0.604 and 1.063, respectively, to 0.874 and 2.865 for validation data. Root mean square error and bias were, respectively, reduced from 1.163 and 0.141 g/100 g to 0.718 and 0.044 g/100 g.

Potassium extracted by ion-exchange resin decreased from 26 mg kg(-1) to 5-10 mg kg(-1) after eight consecutive seasons of growth at the ARI site. Addition of 100 kg K ha(-1) for each rice crop was not enough to maintain initial K availability, especially in the calcareous soil at ARI site. In treatments with K, a small increase in readily available K was observed only in SM soil. The K extracted by HNO3 also decreased significantly in the treatments without K addition and was increased slightly in the treatments with K application. In the NP treatment, the decrease in HNO3-K was several times greater than resin-K, indicating that nonexchangeable K may be the major source of K supply to rice.

Area of study: The site used for the collection of soil samples was situated at an elevation of 6900 feet above sea level (temperate forest in Himalaya region) in the Thandani area national forest located in the north west of Pakistan. Material and methods: For soil sampling and processing, three forest sites with three old tree plants per site were selected at approximately leveled plain for surface soil sampling. Two dust samples were collected and analyzed for different physicochemical properties along with different P fractions. First dust sample was collected from a site situated at an elevation of 4000 feet and second one was collected from an elevation of 6500 feet above sea levels. Modified Hedley procedure for the fractionation of P in the dust and soil samples were used. Main results: The input of dust was 43 and 20 kg ha(-1) during drier months of the year (September-June) at lower and higher elevation sites respectively, and the dust from lower elevation site had relative more all P fractions than the other dust sample. However, HCl-P-i fraction was dominant in both samples. Both labile (water plus NaHCO3) and non-labile (NaOH plus HCl) inorganic P (P-i) fractions were significantly increased in the surface soil by both stemflow and throughfall compared to the open field soil. The buildup of NaOH and HCl-P-i pools in soils underneath the canopy might prove useful in fingerprinting the contribution of atmospheric dust towards P cycling in this temperate forest. Research highlights: The role of dust in the cycling of P in temperate forest in Himalaya region.},

	abstract = {Block kriging (BK) is a common method of predicting the true value at the pixel scale when validating remote sensing retrieval products. However, measurement errors (MEs) increase the prediction uncertainty. In this letter, an extended interpolation technique-BK with MEs (BKMEs)-is developed. The properties of BKME are proven through derivation and demonstrated in a case study of soil moisture (SM) upscaling. Three prediction scenarios-one without MEs (BK), BK with homogeneous MEs (BKHOME), and BK with heterogeneous MEs (BKHEME)-are considered for the upscaling of SM data observed by a distributed wireless sensor network, and the results are compared. Both BK and BKHOME yield the same upscaling results, which differ from those of BKHEME, and the prediction results of BKHEME show less bias than those of the other scenarios. Because both BKHOME and BKHEME consider MEs, their prediction results show smaller kriging variances than do the BK results. Three primary conclusions are drawn. The first is that the optimal kriging coefficients assigned to the observations are affected not only by spatial distance but also by the MEs when the MEs of the samples are unequal. The second is that when the MEs are equal, it may not be necessary to consider the MEs to predict the value for an unobserved location. The third is that although the prediction uncertainty can be reduced by considering MEs, it is more meaningful to consider unequal MEs than equal MEs in the prediction process. BKME is an advanced upscaling method that achieves improved prediction accuracy by considering MEs.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) fertilizer has played an important role in increasing rice and oilseed rape yields, but more than half of the N fertilizer applied into the field has been lost and results in not only an environmental hazard but also a substantial economic loss. Thus, the controlled release N fertilizer was expected to reduce the labor cost from fertilizer dressing, to the convenience of fertilizers application and to increase N use efficiency. A 7-year field fertilization experiment applied controlled-release urea (CRU) 100\% (180 kg ha(-1)), 70\% (126 kg ha(-1)) and 50\% (90 kg ha(-1)) of the recommended N fertilizer to explore its effects on crops yield and soil fertility under the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) rotation system in Hubei province of China. Meanwhile the equivalent rates of N as common urea were supplied as split applications in different growth stages as the control. The N release characteristic of CRU in field condition was closely matched to the demand for N during the whole growth periods of crops. Consequently, the CRU treatments achieved significantly higher rice and oilseed rape yield by 6.1-8.2\% and 6.3-15.5\%, the mean nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) of CRU treatments was increased by 15.4-38.4\%, and the average annual net profit was also increased by 16.0-20.8\%, compared with urea treatment at the same N rate. For each type of N fertilizer, the yield increased as the input N rate increased. However, reducing CRU rate by 30\% produced the same yield of rice and oilseed rape as with the 100\% rate of urea. And, the rice yield of CRU50\% treatment was even showed no significant with Ureal 00\% treatment. The contents of nitrate N (NO3–N) and ammonium N (NH4*-N) were higher in 0-40 cm soil of CRU treatments than urea treatments over 7-year fertilization in 2013, but the opposite trend was found in 60-100 cm soil, which indicating that CRU decreased the NO3–N and NH4+-N leaching to deep in the soil. The contents of total N and organic matter were increased by applying CRU for 7 years compared with urea fertilizer. Although the contents of available P and K were increased over the 7 years of fertilization and cultivation, no prominent difference was observed between CRU70\% and Ureal 00\%. The results suggest that a 30\% decrease in the recommended application rate of N is possible with CRU while maintaining the same yield, preserving the soil fertility and also labor/time-saving.

In all, nine treatments, eight comprising integrated nutrient-use practices, chemical fertilizer (CF), farmyard manure (FYM), and green leaf manure (GLM) to supply nitrogen (N) at 45 kg N ha(-1) and one farmer's practice equivalent to 25 kg N ha(-1) (FYM 5 t ha(-1)), were tested on a long-term basis. Results of the study revealed that 20 kg N ha(-1) (FYM) + 25 kg N (CF) gave maximum mean rice grain yield of 1.52 t ha(-1), followed by 20 kg N (GLM) + 25 kg N (urea) with grain yield of 1.51 t ha(-1). In the case of pigeon pea, 30 kg N (FYM) + 15 kg N (urea) gave maximum pigeon pea grain yield of 0.94 t ha(-1), which was 34\% greater than the sole application of chemical fertilizer. Pigeon pea grain yield tended to increase with increasing proportion of organic N in FYM + CF or GLM + CF combinations. Application of 20 kg N (FYM) + 25 kg N (urea) recorded maximum mean rice equivalent yield of 3.59 t ha(-1) and sustainability yield index of 59\%. While studying profitability, application of 20 kg N (FYM)+ 25 kg N (CF) gave maximum net returns of US\$168.94 ha(-1). Impact of treatments on soil quality as assessed in terms of relative soil quality indices (RSQI) increased with increasing proportion of organic sources of N. Using an innovative and new approach, an index of integrated productivity-sustainability-profitability-soil quality performance index (I-P,I-S,I-Pr,I-SQ) was computed to make a precise evaluation of the treatments. Based on this index, the order of performance of the treatments was T-6 [20 N (FYM) + 25 N (CF)] (7.7) {\textgreater} T-7 [30 N (FYM) + 15 N (CF) (6.9)] {\textgreater} T-3 [20 N (GL) + 25 N (CF)] (6.8) {\textgreater} T-5 [10 N (FYM) + 35 N (CF) (6.6)] {\textgreater} T-9 [GL] (6.5) {\textgreater} T-8 [CF] (6.2) {\textgreater} T-4 [30 N (GL) + 15 N (CF)] (6.0) {\textgreater} T-2 [10 N (GL) + 35 N (CF)] (5.7) {\textgreater} T-1 [FYM at 5 t ha(-1)] (4.1). Thus, the results and the methodology adopted in this study using long-term data would be very useful to researchers, farmers, land managers, and other stakeholders not only in India but also across the world under similar climatic and edaphic situations.},

We hypothesized that both elevated CO2 and elevated temperature would stimulate A(sys) and R-sys. The study was conducted in sun-lit controlled-environment mesocosms using Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii Mirb. Franco) seedlings grown in reconstructed plant-litter-soil systems. A completely randomized design with two atmospheric CO2 and two air temperature levels was used. A mass-balance approach was used to calculate daily mean A(sys) and R-sys rates for 19 months. A mixed model analysis was used to test the effects of CO2 and air temperature on daily A(sys) and R-sys adjusted for covariates of time, light, soil moisture and seasonality. Elevated temperature stimulated A(sys) and R-sys but elevated CO2 did not. Elevated CO2 and temperature both increased light sensitivity and the light saturation level of photosynthesis. Both A(sys) and R-sys were controlled by temperature, soil moisture and endogenous seasonal processes. Temperature sensitivity of R-sys varied seasonally but there was no acclimatization. Because of the close linkage between assimilation and respiration, elevated CO2 failed to stimulate A(sys) and R-sys. Although CO2 is a substrate, assimilate is also controlled by its concentration. Needle-level studies established that increasing CO2 down regulates assimilation through changes in Rubisco, especially if resources are limited. This study shows that increasing CO2 also regulates assimilation allometrically through changes in needle area. Stimulation of assimilation is offset by a reduction in needle area such that the A(sys) and R-sys are similar in ambient and elevated treatments. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {A real-time soil moisture controlled wastewater SDI dispersal system was tested in a Vertisol for approximately one year to regulate soil nitrogen from an artificially prepared septic effluent. The control strategy was to allow wastewater hydraulic disposal only when the drain field moisture level was near field capacity. Due to limited field sampling and resulting uncertainty in rate of field nitrification/denitrification, numerical simulation (HYDRUS 2D) was utilized to assess system control over nitrogen concentrations in the drain field. Using nitrification/denitrification rates estimated from cumulative frequency distributions (CFD), simulated drain field moisture levels were found statistically lower than actual field observations over the entire year, suggesting persistent drain field soil swelling which is theoretically favorable to denitrification. Short- and long-term simulations suggest that denitrification level should be 50\% higher than 50\% CFD (first-order reaction, 0.042 day(-1)). Although no conclusive results are presented, this study indicates a potential management approach that favors denitrification by regulating nitrogen application using soil moisture.

	doi = {10.1175/2007JHM911.1},
	abstract = {A simple and accurate method to estimate regional or global latent heat of evapotranspiration (ET) from remote sensing data is essential. The authors proposed a method in an earlier study that utilized satellite-determined surface net radiation (R-n), a vegetation index, and daytime-averaged/daily maximum air temperature (T-a) or land surface temperature (T-s) data. However, the influence of soil moisture (SM) on ET was not considered and is addressed in this paper by incorporating the diurnal T-s range (DTsR). ET, measured by the energy balance Bowen ratio method at eight enhanced facility sites on the southern Great Plains in the United States and by the eddy covariance method at four AmeriFlux sites during 2001-06, is used to validate the improved method. Site land cover varies from grassland, native prairie, and cropland to deciduous forest and evergreen forest. The correlation coefficient between the measured and predicted 16-day daytime-averaged ET using a combination of R-n, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), daily maximum T-s, and DTsR is about 0.92 for all the sites, the bias is-1.9 W m(-2), and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is 28.6 W m(-2). The sensitivity of the revised method to input data error is small. Implemented here is the revised method to estimate global ET using diurnal T-a range (DTaR) instead of DTsR because DTsR data are not available yet, although DTaR-estimated ET is less accurate than DTsR-estimated ET. Global monthly ET is calculated from 1986 to 1995 at a spatial resolution of 1 degrees x 1 degrees from the International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project (ISLSCP) Initiative II global interdisciplinary monthly dataset and is compared with the 15 land surface model simulations of the Global Soil Wetness Project-2. The results of the comparison of 118 months of global ET show that the bias is 4.5 W m(-2), the RMSE is 19.8 W m(-2), and the correlation coefficient is 0.82. Incorporating DTaR distinctively improves the accuracy of the estimate of global ET.},

In the laboratory, dried soil samples varying in clay content were rewetted with different amounts of water of known isotopic composition. Further, we removed soil carbonate from a subset of samples prior to rewetting. Water was extracted from samples via cryogenic vacuum extraction and analysed by mass spectrometry. The isotopic composition of extracted soil water was similarly depleted in both O-18 and H-2 with decreasing soil moisture and increasing clay and carbonate content. Soil carbonate changed the delta O-18 composition while delta H-2 was not affected. Our results indicate that soil carbonate can cause artifacts for O-18 isotopic composition of soil water. At low soil moisture and high carbonate content this could lead to conflicting results for delta O-18 and delta H-2 in plant water uptake studies.},

We measured nutrients under annual pastures on a beef farm and a dairy farm in the Peel-Harvey catchment, Western Australia. Soils were sampled in 10-mm increments to 100 mm depth in March, June and September. Plant litter contained approximately 300-550 mg kg(-1) Colwell-extractable P. Extractable soil P was strongly stratified, being approximately 100-225 mg kg(-1) (dairy) and 50-110 mg kg(-1) (beef) in the top 10 mm and {\textless}40 mg kg(-1) at 40-50 mm depth. Total P and extractable potassium were also highly stratified, whereas sulfur was less strongly stratified. Shoot nutrient concentrations indicated that nitrogen was often limiting and sulfur was sometimes limiting for pasture growth: concentrations of P were often much greater than required for adequate growth ({\textgreater}4 mg g(-1)). We conclude that high P concentrations at the soil surface and in litter and shoots are a source of risk for movement of P from farms into waterways in the Peel-Harvey catchment.},

Correlations with VIP SSM simulation are generally satisfactory with average values of 0.71 for ASCAT and 0.47 for AMSR-E during 2007-2009. ASCAT and AMSR-E present unbiased errors of 0.044 and 0.053 m(3) m(-3) on average, with respect to model simulation. The empirical orthogonal functions (EOF) analysis results illustrate that AMSR-E provides more consistent SSM spatial structure with VIP than ASCAT; while ASCAT is more capable of capturing SSM temporal dynamics. This is supported by the facts that ASCAT has more consistent expansion coefficients corresponding to primary EOF mode with VIP (R=0.825, p{\textless}0.1). However, comparison based on SSM anomaly demonstrates that AMSR-E and ASCAT have similar skill in capturing SSM short-term variability. Temporal analysis of SSM anomaly time series shows that AMSR-E provides best performance in autumn, while ASCAT provides lower anomaly bias during highly-vegetated summer with vegetation optical depth of 0.61. Moreover, ASCAT retrieval accuracy is less influenced by vegetation cover, as it is in relatively better agreement with VIP simulation in forest than in other land-use types and exhibits smaller interannual fluctuation than AMSR-E. Identification of the error characteristics of these two microwave soil moisture data sets will be helpful for correctly interpreting the data products and also facilitate optimal specification of the error matrix in data assimilation at a regional scale.},

The objective of this study was to assess effects of long-term (1992-2010) tillage practices, including a partial-width tillage system (paraplow) on N concentration and stratification. The tillage treatments were: no-tillage (NT), minimum tillage (18-22 cm depth) with chisel plow (MT), conventional tillage (25-30 cm depth) with mouldboard plow (CT) and zone-tillage subsoiling (25-30 cm) with a paraplow (ZT) applied in alternate years in rotation with NT. The soil was a Calcic Haploxeralf from Central Spain. The crop rotation was chick pea (Cicer arietinun L.) cv. Inmaculada/barley (Hordeum vulgare L) cv. Volley. The equivalent mass approach was used to compare N stocks in the various tillage methods. Tillage treatments had significant effects on soil bulk density and no-till increased soil bulk density of the top layer. At the end of 19 years, the stocks of N had increased under NT compared with MT and CT. Most changes occurred within the 0-5 cm layer, where plots under NT had 0.48 Mg N ha(-1) and 0.53 Mg N ha(-1) greater than in MT and CT, respectively. Zone tillage maintained most of the long-term benefit of NT in increasing N stocks in the top layer (0-5 cm). At the end of the experiment, total N concentration in the 0-5 cm depth under ZT was 42\% and 53\% higher that under MT and CT, respectively. Stratification ratios of N from 1992 to 2000 showed no significant differences between NT, MT and CT. In contrast, from 2001 onwards, all stratification ratios were significantly higher in NT than in the other two tillage systems. In addition, in 2010 the stratification ratio of N in NT was {\textgreater}2 and more than 2-fold those obtained in MT and CT. Values of stratification ratios under ZT followed the same trend than under NT and were significantly greater than under MT or CT. These greater stratification ratios of N observed under NT and ZT confirm, in the soil studied, not only the benefits associated with the long-term application of no-till in increasing total N in the top layer, but also the positive impact of the use of a paraplow as a rotational tillage system.

Rice (Oryza sativa L.) and winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were grown under ambient CO2 or FACE (ambient + 200 mu mol mol(-1) CO2) conditions throughout the growth season. Low N (LN) and normal N (NN) were applied, LN being 150 kg ha(-1) for rice and 125 kg ha(-1) for wheat and NN being 250 kg ha(-1) for both rice and wheat. Compared with the ambient [CO2] condition, elevated [CO2] significantly increased crop biomass and P uptake for both rice and wheat and N uptake only for wheat at several main growth stages. The positive effects of elevated [CO2] on biomass, N and P uptake of wheat were greater than of rice. Soil available N was decreased by elevated [CO2] by 47\% in LN and 29\% in NN at the rice tillering stage at jointing stage and decreased by 25.4\% and 28.3\% in LN and by 33.3\% and 53.1\% in NN at the wheat seeding and heading stages, respectively. Soil available P was decreased by elevated [CO2] in rice by 32.0\% in LN and by 29.6\% in NN at the jointing stage, but increased by 22.4\% and 20.8\% at the heading stage and by 33.8\% and 30.7\% at the ripening stage in LN and NN, respectively. While in the wheat season, soil available P was not affected significantly by elevated [CO2] at each stage. These results suggest that under elevated [CO2] availability of soil N and P increased, particularly P and application of N and P should be adjusted to need for rice at tillering and jointing and for wheat at whole growth stages.

This study validated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E) soil moisture data with the Common Land Model (CLM), one of the most widely used LSMs, and ground-based measurements at two Korean regional flux monitoring network sites. There was reasonable agreement regarding the different soil moisture products for monitoring temporal trends except National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) AMSR-E soil moisture, albeit there were essential comparison limitations by different spatial scales and soil depths. The AMSR-E soil moisture data published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) showed potential to replicate temporal variability patterns (root-mean-square errors = 0.100.14 m(3) m(-3) and wet BIAS = 0.09 - 0.04 m(3) m(-3)) with the CLM and ground-based measurements. However, the NSIDC AMSR-E soil moisture was problematic because of the extremely low temporal variability and the VUA AMSR-E soil moisture was relatively inaccurate in Gwangneung site characterized by complex geophysical conditions. Additional evaluations should be required to facilitate the use of recent and forthcoming remotely sensed soil moisture data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive missions at representative future validation sites.

	abstract = {Soil moisture distributions with high spatio-temporal resolution are scarce but beneficial for understanding ecohydrological processes and closing the water cycle at the basin scale. Sensor networks are innovative in their ability to capture the spatio-temporal heterogeneity and dynamics of soil moisture; however, they cannot be used to directly derive spatially continuous soil moisture distributions. A Bayesian-based upscaling algorithm that utilizes MODIS-derived apparent thermal inertia is used to map daily soil moisture spatial patterns with a resolution of 1 km in the Babao River Basin, China. The 2-4 cm soil moisture observations from seven automatic meteorological stations located in different elevation zones from 3000 m to 3500 m are employed to validate the mapping algorithm. The correlation coefficient and unbiased root-mean-square error (RMSE) averaged 0.880 and 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively, which indicate satisfactory estimation accuracy. The 1 km resolution soil moisture products are re-sampled to a resolution of 25 km and then compared to the level 3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity Mission (SMOS) soil moisture product. The results show that both products exhibit strong temporal consistency; however, due to complex topography, the SMOS soil moisture is generally lower than that of the upscaling results. Semivariograms and an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis are used to analyze the space-time heterogeneities of soil moisture at the 1 km scale. In the summer, rainfall results in soil moisture with low spatial variability and a complex spatial structure. After the rainy season, the spatial heterogeneity of soil moisture is affected by other factors, such as soil texture, evapotranspiration and topography. From the perspective of temporal variation, the upscaled soil moisture shows a well-defined seasonal cycle, which represents the effects of decreased rainfall from August to October. Because more rain falls in the summer due to the mountain microclimate, the oscillation in soil moisture is more pronounced over 20\% of the area compared to that in other regions. Based on a validation analysis of the mapping results, the upscaling method is proven feasible, and the upscaled soil moisture can be used to analyze eco-hydrological processes and validate remote sensing products.

However, the effect of soil nutrient management practices on GHG flux and global warming potential (GWP) is less understood in agricultural soils of India. The present study was conducted to compare three nutrient management systems practiced for nine consecutive years in a soybean-wheat cropping system in the Vertisols of India, in terms of GHG flux and GWP. The treatments were composed of 100\% organic (ONM), 100\% inorganic (NPK), and integrated nutrient management (INM) with 50\% organic + 50\% inorganic inputs. The gas samples for GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O) were collected by static chamber method at about 15-day interval during 2012-13 growing season. The change in soil organic carbon (SOC) content was estimated in terms of the changes in SOC stock in the 0-15 cm soil over the 9-year period covering 2004 to 2013. There was a net uptake of CH4 in all the treatments in both soybean and wheat crop seasons. The cumulative N2O and CO2 emissions were in the order of INM {\textgreater} ONM {\textgreater} NPK with significant difference between treatments (p {\textless} 0.05) in both the crop seasons. The annual GWP, expressed in terms of CH4 and N2O emission, also followed the same trend and was estimated to be 1126, 1002, and 896 kg CO2 eq ha(-1) yea(r-1) under INM, ONM, and NPK treatments, respectively. However, the change in SOC stock was significantly higher under ONM (1250 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) followed by INM (417 kg ha(-1) year-1) and least under NPK (198 kg ha(-1) year(-1)) treatment. The wheat equivalent yield was similar under ONM and INM treatments and was significantly lower under NPK treatment. Thus, the GWP per unit grain yield was lower under ONM followed by NPK and INM treatments and varied from 250, 261, and 307 kg CO2 eq Mg-1 grain yield under ONM, NPK, and INM treatments, respectively.},

Cattle commenced grazing the following spring and grazed until May. In the summer, plots were overseeded with cowpea (Vigna unguiculata), fertilized at the same rates by reference to N recommendations for bermudagrass, and grazed by cattle until September. There were no effects of N fertilization on soil phosphatase activity, electrical conductivity, or concentrations of water-soluble P. Concentrations of extractable P decreased in plots receiving 50N, but increasing N fertilization to 100N resulted in no further reduction in extractable P. Forage biomass, foliar P concentrations, and forage P mass were not affected by N fertilization rates at the plant-community level, but responses were observed within individual forage species. Results are interpreted to mean that N fertilization at 50\% of the agronomic recommendation for the grass component can increase forage P mass of specific forages and decrease soil extractable P, thus providing opportunity for decreasing P losses from grazed pasture.

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of field-scale root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is essential for hydro-meteorological and agricultural management. The cosmic-ray neutron probe (CRNP) is an innovative technique for field-scale soil moisture observation. However, it is limited at deeper depths, and requires suitable methods for scaling the CRNP effective depth to represent the root-zone layer (up to 100 cm depth). A merging framework was developed in this study for improving field-scale RZSM with the CRNP via coupling the representative ancillary RZSM information with cosmic-ray soil moisture. By using ancillary RZSM retrieved at the most time stable location, this approach alleviates the problems associated with lack of independent datasets, while maintaining scale representativeness. A linear autoregressive model was adopted to forecast the errors between two input datasets (the cosmic-ray soil moisture and ancillary RZSM) and a reference product, which was computed by spatially weighting the deepest in-situ soil moisture measurements apart from the most time stable location. The variances of estimated errors were then used to compute a suitable weight for each single product by following the original linear combination of forecasts, and subsequently merging the ancillary RZSM and cosmic-ray soil moisture. Performance of the merged RZSM in comparison to input datasets and exponential filter-based RZSM over three different environments was evaluated against the reference RZSM product. The results indicated that differences in vegetation coverages related to total aboveground and belowground biomass accumulation, root water uptake rate and canopy density are the major factors controlling the temporal variation in merged RZSM, and they can be partly interpreted via the framework procedure. Superior performance achieved by the merging framework demonstrated its robustness in improving field-scale RZSM measurement compared to other products. This study also underlines the strong relationship between input data quality and the performance of the selected merging method, with respect to variations of CRNP effective depths. Overall, the merging framework is simple to apply, enables unrestricted-use in different environments, and is flexible to combine further standalone data sources.},

	abstract = {At radar frequencies below 2 GHz, the mismatch between the 5 to 15 cm sensing depth of classical time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe soil moisture measurements and the radar penetration depth can easily lead to unreliable in situ data. Accurate quantitative measurements of soil water contents at various depths by classical methods are cumbersome and usually highly invasive. We propose an improved method for the estimation of vertical soil moisture profiles from multi-offset ground penetrating radar (GPR) data. A semi-automated data acquisition technique allows for very fast and robust measurements in the field. Advanced common mid-point (CMP) processing is applied to obtain quantitative estimates of the permittivity and depth of the reflecting soil layers. The method is validated against TDR measurements using data acquired in different environments. Depth and soil moisture contents of the reflecting layers were estimated with root mean square errors (RMSE) on the order of 5 cm and 1.9 Vol.-\%, respectively. Application of the proposed technique for the validation of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) soil moisture estimates is demonstrated based on a case study using airborne L-band data and ground-based P-band data. For the L-band case we found good agreement between the near-surface GPR estimates and extended integral equation model ((IEM)-E-2) based SAR retrievals, comparable to those obtained by TDR. At the P-band, the GPR based method significantly outperformed the TDR method when using soil moisture estimates at depths below 30 cm.},

In a 21-yr field experiment conducted under subhumid tropical conditions in India, the impacts of crop residue C inputs were assessed for the rice (Oryza sativa L.)-lentil (Lens esculenta Moench) cropping sequence. These impacts were evaluated in an experiment involving mineral fertilizers and manuring treatments on crop yield sustainability with reference to critical biomass requirements for maintenance of SOC in an Inceptisol. Application of farmyard manure (FYM) without and with mineral fertilizers increased C input and SOC concentration and stock. In comparison with the control, the 100\% organic (FYM) treatment had significantly higher profile SOC (27.5 Mg ha(-1)), and more C build up (55.0\%) and C sequestration (6.6 Mg C ha(-1)) to 1-m depth vis-a-vis the antecedent values in 1986. These parameters were also higher in 100\% FYM treatment at a rate providing equivalent amount of the recommended dose of N followed by conjunctive use of FYM and mineral fertilizers. The SOC stock and rate of sequestration were positively correlated with cumulative C input, and with sustainable yield index (SYI) of upland rice and lentil. Higher grain yield (1.95 and 1.04 Mg ha(-1) of rice and lentil, respectively) was obtained with the application of 50\% organic (FYM)+50\% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF). In comparison, higher SOC sequestration rate was measured with the application of 100\% organic (FYM). For every Mg increase in SOC stock in the root zone there was 0.16 and 0.18 Mg ha(-1)yr(-1) yield increase of rice and lentil, respectively. For maintaining a stable SOC level (zero change due to cropping), a minimum quantity of 2.47 Mg C ha(-1) yr(-1) is required for this soil, climate, cropping system, and fertilization treatments. To achieve this quantity of C, 7.1 Mg of biomass is required to be produced every year vs. average rice and lentil yields of 1.6 and 0.7 Mg ha(-1), respectively. The sole application of mineral fertilizers at 50 or 100\% of the RDF did not maintain the SOC stock. Thus, application of FYM (or other organics) in conjunction with mineral fertilizers is essential to maintaining and enhancing the SOC stock in the rice-based cropping systems.},

	abstract = {In the Wadi Laba spate irrigation system, sorghum and maize crops complete their growth period (September to April) mainly based on the soil moisture stored during the flood season from 15 June to 15 August. For the past 100 years, the farmers have strived to divert the unpredictable and destructive floods and irrigate their fields three to four times (irrigation gift is 50 cm each time) so as to harvest 4.5 t ha(-1) yr(-1) of sorghum or sorghum and maize. Simultaneously, to realize fair water sharing, the farmers introduced two water rights and rules: (1) a field is entitled to a second, third or fourth turn only after all other fields have received one, two or three turns respectively; (2) upstream fields have a priority right to the medium floods ({\textless}= 50 m(3) s(-1)), the midstream and downstream fields to the moderately large and large (50-200 m(3) s(-1)), and very large (200-265 m(3) s(-1)) floods respectively. These water rights and rules were regularly observed in the indigenous systems when farmers relied on each other for the timely maintenance of the earthen/brushwood structures that frequently failed, but are being violated following the introduction of the concrete structures in 2000. The Soil Water Accounting Model (SWAM) that has been developed as part of the study on which this paper is based revealed that when a field receives two, three or four turns, the soil moisture at the onset of the planting season remains the same, namely 67.5, 72 and 77.5 cm if the field gets its last turn by 15 July, 30 July and 15 August respectively. These results were validated with the more complex Soil Water Atmosphere Plant Model (SWAP). Even the 67.5 cm water depth (with some 120 mm contribution from rainfall), sufficiently supports the said yield. Unlike in the indigenous system, when the fields usually received a third turn by the end of the flood season, the concrete structures of the modern system have made it possible for the upstream farmers to irrigate three or even four times by July. Thus, to maintain fairness of water sharing, the water rights on the size of floods would have to be modified to: regardless of the flood size, if upstream fields are irrigated twice or three times by 15-30 July, the subsequent floods would have to be conveyed to the midstream/downstream fields.

This paper presents a comprehensive comparison of SM versus SST impacts on land climate in the warm season. The authors perform fully coupled ensemble experiments with the Community Earth System Model in which they prescribe SM or SSTs to the long-term median seasonal cycles. It is found that SM variability overall impacts warm-season land climate to a similar extent as SST variability, in the midlatitudes, tropics, and subtropics. Removing SM or SST variability impacts land climate means and reduces land climate variability at different time scales by 10\%-50\% (temperature) and 0\%-10\% (precipitation). Both SM- and SST-induced changes are strongest for hot temperatures (up to 50\%) and for extreme precipitation (up to 20\%). These results are qualitatively similar for the present day and the end of the twenty-first century. Removed SM variability affects surface climate through corresponding variations in surface energy fluxes, and this is controlled to first order by the land-atmosphere coupling strength and the natural SM variability. SST-related changes are partly controlled by the relation of local temperature or precipitation with the El Nino-Southern Oscillation. In addition, in specific regions SST-induced SM changes alter the “direct” SST-induced climate changes; on the other hand, SM variability is found to slightly affect SSTs in some regions. Nevertheless a large level of independence is found between SM-climate and SST-climate coupling. This highlights the fact that SM conditions can influence land climate variables independently of any SST effects and that (initial) soil moisture anomalies can provide valuable information in (sub)seasonal weather forecasts.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important parameter that is widely used for drought monitoring and characterizing environment. Based on the universal triangular space constructed by the normalized land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), this study proposes a simple method to estimate surface soil moisture (SSM) using a nonlinear interpolation function with theoretical limiting edges derived from the energy balance principle. As an interpolation function, the quadratic polynomial equation is used to reveal the relationships among soil moisture, LST, and fractional vegetation cover (FVC), which are determined and validated by the simulation data from the Noah land surface model (Noah LSM). The developed function is much simpler than Carlson's function because the number of coefficients is reduced by half. The proposed method is applied to the North China Plain. The estimation results are also validated by the in situ measurements of soil water content at 10 and 20 cm depths at the Yucheng meteorological station; the corresponding biases are as high as 0.02 and 0.12 m(3)/m(3), respectively, and the root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) are approximately 0.04 and 0.10 m(3)/m(3), respectively. The results indicate that this method has high-estimation accuracy and overcomes the weakness induced by the effects of atmospheric conditions on different days. This study provides insight into the comparable soil moisture estimation from remotely sensed data on a regional scale.},

Here we use a novel diagnostic based on the observed warming of the land relative to the atmosphere during dry spells (relative warming rate, RWR) to assess ESMs. The ESMs show that RWR is well correlated with changes in the partition of surface energy between sensible and latent heat across dry spells. Therefore, comparisons between observed and simulated RWR reveal where models are unable to capture a realistic soil moisture-heat flux relationship. The results show that in general, models simulate dry spell ET dynamics well in arid zones while decreases in evaporative fraction appear excessive in some models in continental climate zones. Our approach can help guide land model development in aspects that are key in simulating extreme events like heat waves. Plain Language Summary We present a methodology to assess how land evapotranspiration (ET) responds to soil moisture (SM) in climate models across the world. Our method is based on looking at the observed versus modeled evolution of land surface temperature and the overlying air temperature during rain free periods, when SM decreases and limits the amount of land ET. We observed a good relationship between modeled ET and the modeled relative evolution of these temperatures during dry periods. Therefore, our method can be used to evaluate how realistic are modeled SM-ET relationships when soils are drying. Our results show that in general, models capture fairly well the influence of SM on ET in arid climate zones, while they perform less well in continental climate zones. Our method provides a unique new tool to improve aspects of weather and climate models important for simulating phenomena such as heat waves.},

	abstract = {In model-based irrigation control, the root zone soil moisture deficit (RZSMD) is maintained based on the water balance. To predict RZSMD in real-time, effective rainfall, irrigation and crop evapotranspiration need to be calculated online. Estimating the first two variables is more important yet tedious due to practical limitations of knowing the amount of water actually infiltrated into the soil. In order to solve this problem, we propose to apply system identification on water balance data to obtain a linear time series model. We further investigate how to carry out the modelling (i) under saturated conditions, (ii) when there is a rule-based irrigation control, and (iii) under measurement noise in the soil moisture readings. Using synthetic data we obtained a model fit above 80\% in all cases. Additionally, we show the model optimality and applicability with an independent dataset, using residual tests. For two sets of field data, we observed model fits of 84\% and 63\%, and satisfaction in all residual tests. Simplicity in the model reduces calibration efforts whereas its linearity and adequacy recommend it for real-time irrigation control applications. In summary, the results indicate that a first order linear time series model based on system identification can successfully predict RZSMD in a real-time irrigation control system.

	abstract = {Although recent years have witnessed excellent technological improvements, the initial setup costs of solar energy systems remain very high. It is for this reason that solar systems have not become sufficiently widespread. Optimum selection of panel power increases the applicability of these systems while at the same time decreasing their cost. The choice of which panel power is to be installed in a solar powered irrigation system will vary in direct proportion to the power of the pump supplying the water. In this study a reduction in pump power, and thus a reduction in the energy demand of the pump, is achieved by ensuring that the solar-powered drip irrigation system in an orchard is using water efficiently. To determine which areas needed to be irrigated, the authors used a soil moisture distribution map obtained via the artificial neural networks method. Using the system and software they developed to determine the soil moisture distribution, they were able to obtain an even distribution of water. Thus by preventing unnecessary irrigation, not only was instantaneous water demand reduced, but it was also possible to ensure the protection of freshwater resources. The system developed by the authors was observed to reduce the orchard's daily water and energy consumption by 38\%. Thus, using the method applied, it was possible to reduce the amount of pump power, depending on the instantaneous water demand, the total power of the solar panels, the current values of the electrical motor, the battery and power control units, and all other costs.

Hence, the estimation of soil moisture is very valuable in the social, economic, humanitarian (food security) and environmental segments of society. Extensive efforts to exploit the potential of remotely sensed observations to help quantify this complex variable are ongoing. This study aims at developing a new index, the Thermal Ground cover Moisture Index (TGMI), for estimating soil moisture content. This index is based on empirical parameterization of the relationship between raw image digital count (DC) data in the thermal infrared spectral band and ground cover (determined from raw image digital count data in the red and near-infrared spectral bands). The index uses satellite-derived information only, and the potential for its operational application is therefore great. This study was conducted in 18 commercial agricultural fields near Lubbock, TX (USA). Soil moisture was measured in these fields over two years and statistically compared to corresponding values of TGMI determined from Landsat image data. Results indicate statistically significant correlations between TGMI and field measurements of soil moisture (R-2 = 0.73, RMSE = 0.05, MBE = 0.17 and AAE = 0.049), suggesting that soil moisture can be estimated using this index. It was further demonstrated that maps of TGMI developed from Landsat imagery could be constructed to show the relative spatial distribution of soil moisture across a region.},

With this aim, a new “bottom-up” validation approach is proposed based on the synergistic use of in situ SSM measurements from the soil moisture measurement station network (REMEDHUS) of the University of Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain, and optical/thermal infrared observations over 18 cloud-free days from Landsat-8. An SSM estimation method using the boundary information from the land surface temperature and normalized difference vegetation index triangle space was developed for regional SSM mapping. The retrieved SSM reached a relatively good performance (mean R 2 and rootmean-squared error of 0.64 and 0.033 ne/m(3), respectively). Then, the regional SSM was aggregated into the grid-cell scale of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) L3 high-resolution (0.1 degrees /10 km) soil moisture product to validate it both at network and grid-cell levels. At the network level, the derived regional SSM showed a good agreement with the averaged in situ measurements over the network (R = 0.731). However, at the grid-cell level, small variations were observed for the cells over the network between the estimates and the AMSR2 product, with negative biases (-0.044 to -0.090 m(3)/m(3)) and positive correlations (R {\textgreater} 0.25) for most cells. In addition, it is shown that the descending product has a slightly better performance than does the ascending one. The preliminary assessments suggested that the proposed method provides new insights into the validation of passive microwave soil moisture products, while avoiding the common issue related to the big disparity in spatial scales between satellite observation and in situ measurements.},

Agronomic improvement requires knowledge of whole-plant phenotypes expressed in response to simultaneous variation in these essential resources. Most phenotypes, however, have been described from experiments where resources are varied singularly. To test the importance of varying shoot and root resources for phenotyping studies, sister pre-breeding lines of wheat were phenotyped in response to independent or simultaneous exposure to two light levels and soil moisture profiles. The distribution and architecture of the root systems depended strongly on the moisture of the deeper soil layer. For one genotype, roots, specifically lateral roots, were stimulated to grow into moist soil when the upper zone was well-watered and were inhibited by drier deep zones. In contrast, the other genotype showed much less plasticity and responsiveness to upper moist soil, but maintained deeper penetration of roots into the dry layer. The sum of shoot and root responses was greater when treated simultaneously to low light and low soil water, compared to each treatment alone, suggesting the value of whole plant phenotyping in response to multiple conditions for agronomic improvement. The results suggest that canopy management for increased irradiation of leaves would encourage root growth into deeper drier soil, and that genetic variation within closely related breeding lines may exist to favour surface root growth in response to irrigation or in-season rainfall.},

	abstract = {To better predict the soil moisture environment of cool-temperate forests, we studied the soil moisture for stands grown under elevated Co-2 concentration ([Co-2]) using Free Air Co-2 Enrichment (FACE) systems (50 Pa [CO2](e)) with controls at ambient levels (37 Pa [CO2](a))), over two years. Two distinct soil conditions, brown forest soil and volcanic ash soil, were prepared in each FACE. Two-year-old seedlings of six species were planted in May 2003. The soil moisture increased under [CO2](e) in both soil conditions. Since changes of soil moisture depend on evapotranspiration from a stand, we examined the fluctuation of soil moisture in relation to the transpiration (Tr) from leaves and evaporation (Ev) from the soil surface in the FACE. The Tr per leaf area decreased under [CO2](e) for both soil conditions, although the total Tr per seedling increased because the total leaf area per seedling increased under [CO2](e). Ev decreased under [CO2](e), because the soil surface temperature fell in both soils as a result of the increase of leaf area index (LAI), which blocked incident sunlight at the soil surface. These results show that the increase of soil moisture under [CO2](e) over two years is due probably to the change in Ev. Our results also indicate that the predicted rise in atmospheric [CO2] will lead to modification of the forest ecosystem accompanied by changing soil moisture conditions.},

We perform horizontally coupled assimilation experiments where pixels are updated not only by observations at the same location but also all in the study domain. Carrying out sensitivity studies within a multiscale assimilation system is a significant advancement over previous studies that used a 1-D assimilation framework where all horizontal grids are uncoupled. Twin experiments are performed with synthetic soil moisture retrievals. The hydrologic modeling system is forced with satellite estimated rainfall, and the assimilation performance is evaluated against model simulations using in-situ measured rainfall. The study shows that the assimilation performance is most sensitive to the spatial availability of soil moisture observations, then to revisit time and least sensitive to retrieval accuracy. The horizontally coupled assimilation system performs reasonably well even with large observation errors, and it is less sensitive to retrieval accuracy than the uncoupled system, as reported by previous studies. This suggests that more information may be extracted from satellite soil moisture observations using multiscale assimilation systems resulting in a potentially higher value of such satellite products.},

This study aimed to examine the influence of plant phosphorus (P) status and P distribution in the root zone on root P acquisition and root and shoot growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a split-root soil culture. One compartment (A) was supplied with either 4 or 14 mg P (kg soil)(-1), whereas the adjoining compartment (B) had 4 mg Pkg(-1) with a vertical high-P strip (44 mg kg(-1)) at 90-110 mm from the plant. Three weeks after growing in the split-root system, plants with 4 mg P kg-1 (low-P plants) started to show stimulatory root growth in the high-P strip. Two weeks later, root dry weight and length density in the high-P strip were significantly greater for the low-P plants than for the plants with 14 mg P (kg soil)(-1). However, after 8 weeks of growth in the split-root system, the two P treatments of compartment A had similar root growth in the high-P strip of compartment B. The study also showed that shoot P concentrations in the low-P plants were 0.6-0.8 mg g(-1) compared with 1.7-1.9 mg g(-1) in the 14 mg P kg(-1) plants after 3 and 5 weeks of growth, but were similar (1.1-1.4 mg g(-1)) between the two plants by week 8. The low-P plants had lower root P concentration in both compartments than those with 14 mg P kg(-1) throughout the three harvests. The findings may indicate that root proliferation and P acquisition under heterogeneous conditions are influenced by shoot P status (internal) and soil P distribution (external). There were no differences in the total root and shoot dry weight between the two P treatments at weeks 3 and 5 because enhanced root growth and P uptake in the high-P strip by the low-P plants were compensated by reduced root growth elsewhere. In contrast, total plant growth and total root and shoot P contents were greater in the 14 mg P kg(-1) soil than in the low-P soil at week 8. The two P treatments did not affect the ratio of root to shoot dry weight with time. The results suggest that root proliferation and greater P uptake in the P-enriched zone may meet the demand for P by P-deficient plants only for a limited period of time.},

	abstract = {Revegetation is an important means to improve the ecosystem services delivered by degraded land; however, inappropriate revegetation can result in severe soil desiccation and ecosystem degradation in water-limited regions. Here we evaluated seven common revegetation techniques by considering both deep soil moisture deficit and soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration on the Loess Plateau of China, attempting to identify a suitable method for soil restoration of severely degraded ecosystems. The seven revegetation techniques considered were: two single-species shrub plantations (Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides), two single species tree plantations (Platycladus orientalis with terracing and Robinia pseudoacacia), and three mixed plantations (P. orientalis/H. rhamnoides with terracing, R. pseudoacacia/H. rhamnoides, R. pseudoacacia/P. orientalis). A 12-year-old abandoned cropland served as the control. The results showed that the single-species plantation of P. orientalis with terracing had the lowest soil moisture deficit in deep layers (200-800 cm) but also had the lowest SOC sequestration. In contrast, the mixed plantation of R. pseudoacacia/H. rhamnoides had the highest SOC sequestration but also had significant deep soil moisture deficit. In contrast, the mixed plantation of P. orientalis/H. rhamnoides with terracing showed near-zero deep soil moisture deficit and significant, positive SOC sequestration. Therefore, this mixed plantation was identified as representing a suitable revegetation technique for this region. The results here suggest that appropriate mixed tree/shrub plantations with appropriate land engineering measures could deliver effective soil restoration in such environments. Our results provide an insight into revegetation in areas with degraded land.},

The objective of this study was to determine influence of soil pH on grain yield and its components, and use of nutrients by dry bean in a no-tillage system in an Oxisol (Typic Haplorthox) of the Cerrado region of Brazil. Five field experiments were conducted for three consecutive years. The pH levels were low (5.3), medium (6.4), and high (6.8), created by applying lime at the rates of 0, 12, and 24 Mg ha(-1). Grain yield and its components were significantly influenced by soil pH. Adequate pH for grain yield and its components was 6.4. Maximum variation in grain yield was measured by shoot dry weight, and minimum variation was due to 100-grain weight. Nutrient utilization efficiency was in the order of magnesium (Mg) {\textgreater} phosphorus (P) {\textgreater} calcium (Ca) {\textgreater} potassium (K) {\textgreater} nitrogen (N) {\textgreater} copper (Cu) {\textgreater} manganese (Mn) {\textgreater} zinc (Zn) {\textgreater} iron (Fe). Soil extractable P increased linearly with increasing pH in the range of 5.3 to 7.3.

	abstract = {Crops grown grown in semiarid tainted conditions are prone to water stress which could be alleviated by improving cultural practices. This study determined the effect of cropping system, cultivar, soil nitrogen status and Rhizobium inoculation (Rz) on water use and water use efficiency (WUE) of chickpea (Cicer arietinum L) in semiarid environments. The cultivars Amit, CDC Anna, CDC Frontier, and CDC Xena were grown in no-till barley, no-till wheat, and tilled-fallow systems and under various rates of N fertilizer (0, 28, 56, 84, and 112 kg N ha(-1)) coupled with or without Rz. The study was conducted at Swift Current and Shaunavon, Saskatchewan, from 2004 to 2006. On average, chickpea used about 10 mm of water from the top 0-15 cm soil depth. In the tilled-fallow system, chickpea extracted 20\% more water in the 15-30 cm depth, 70\% more in the 30-60 cm depth, and 156\% more in the 60-120 cm depth than when it was grown in the no-till systems. CDC Xena had WUE of 5.3 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) or 20\% less than the average WUE (6.6 kg ha(-1) mm(-1)) of the three other cultivars, even though these cultivars used the same amounts of water. Water use efficiency increased from 4.7 to 6.8 kg ha(-1) mm(-1) as N fertilizer rate was increased from 0 to 112 kg N ha(-1) when chickpea was grown in the no-till barley or wheat systems, but chickpea grown in the tilled-fallow system did not respond to changes in the fertilizer N rates averaging WUE of 6.5 kg ha(-1) mm(-1). In the absence of N fertilizer, the application of Rz increased WUE by 33\% for chickpea grown in the no-till barley system, 30\% in the no-till wheat system, and 9\% in the tilled-fallow system. Chickpea inoculated with Rhizobium achieved a WUE value similar to the crop fertilized at 84 kg N ha(-1). Without the use of Rz, chickpea increased WUE in a linear fashion with increasing fertilizer N rates from 0 to 84 kg N ha(-1). Cropping system, cultivar, and inoculation all had greater impact on WUE than on the amount of water extracted by the crop from the soil. The improvement of cultural practices to promote general plant health along with the development of cultivars with improved crop yields will be keys for improving water use efficiency of chickpea in semiarid environments.

The organically fertilized onions were compared with inorganically fertilized onions grown in the same field. Inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) in the row at sowing or during commercial transplant production was tested but did not significantly affect mycorrhizal root colonization levels in the field. Onions that received no fertilizer at all or that had fertilizer placed between rows had better establishment, probably due to more favorable soil nitrogen concentrations for seedling emergence. Broadcast application led to higher nitrogen concentration in the root zone, resulting in fewer but larger individual onions. Quercetin levels were not significantly altered as a result of nitrogen fertilizer source (inorganic or organic), application method, or mycorrhizal inoculation. However, variation between years was significant, with quercetin levels in 2004 almost twice as high as those in 2005.},

	abstract = {Manure generated by dairy cattle is a useful soil amendment but contributes to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and water pollution from nutrient leaching. In order to assess the impact of pine chip biochar produced at a peak temperature of 550 degrees C when added to a dairy grassland system, a one-year field study was conducted on a sandy loam soil under annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) grown for silage in Petaluma, California. Manure was applied to all plots at a rate of ca. 150 m(3) ha(-1) (410 kg N ha(-1)). Control plots received no biochar, high application biochar plots (FIB) received biochar (with a 17\% ash content) at a rate of 18.8 t ha(-1), and low application biochar plots (LB) received the same biochar at 5.7 t ha(-1). Although the HB plots demonstrated the lowest cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) emissions, there was no significant difference between treatments (p = 0.152 and p = 0.496, respectively). Soil pH results from samples collected throughout the year indicated a significant treatment effect (p = 0.046), though Tukey test results indicated that there was no difference between mean values. Soil total carbon was significantly higher in HB plots at the end of the experiment (p = 0.025) and nitrate (NO3-) intensity throughout the year (which expresses potential exposure of NO3- to the soil microbial community) was significantly lower in HB plots compared to the control (p = 0.001). Annual cumulative potassium (K+) loss from FIB plots was significantly higher than from the other treatments (p = 0.018). HB plots also demonstrated a short-term increase in phosphorus (P) and ammonium (NH4+) in leachate during the first rainfall event following manure and biochar application (p {\textless} 0.0001 and p = 0.0002, respectively) as well as a short-term decrease of NO3- in leachate during a heavy rainfall event following a long dry spell (p = 0.036), though differences between treatments for cumulative nutrient losses were not significant (p = 0.210, p = 0.061, and p = 0.295, respectively for P, NH4+, and NO3-). These data indicate that biochar produced from pine wood chips at 550 degrees C having high ash content (17\%) is not likely to impact GHG emissions in systems with high manure application rates. Further research should be conducted in order to investigate the impact of biochar amendment on the dynamics and mobility of nutrients applied in subsequent repeated applications of dairy manure.

The highest cane yield (78.6 t ha(-1)) was recorded in the plant crop given vermicompost + Gd, whereas ratoon yields (first and second) were highest (80.8 and 74.9 t/ha(-1), respectively) with sulphitation press mud cake (SPMC) + Gd. In both plant and ratoon crops, a number of different organic manures produced the highest cane yield that was also statistically similar to those obtained with using the recommended NPK levels (76.1, 78.2 and 71.7 t/ha for plant crop and subsequent two ratoons, respectively). The highest benefit:cost (B:C) ratio in the plant and two ratoon crops (1.28, 2.36, 2.03 respectively) were obtained with the addition of SPMC + Gd. The nutrient balance for NPK in the soil was highest in the SPMC + Gd treatment. The highest increase in organic C (94\%) and total N (87\%), in comparison to the initial level, and soil microbial biomass C (113\%) and soil microbial biomass N (229\%), in comparison to the control treatment, was recorded with the addition of SPMC + Gd. The maximum decrease in soil bulk density (BD) (12\%) with an increase in soil aggregate (17\%) and water infiltration rate (35\%) was obtained with the addition of SPMC. Overall, the sugarcane crop responded well to different organic manures in a multiple ratooning system with a better economic output and improved soil quality. Strategic planning in terms of an integrated application of these manures with inorganic chemicals will not only sustain our soils but will also be beneficial for our farmers in terms of reducing their dependence and expenditure on chemical fertilizers.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates estimation of root zone soil moisture using two passive microwave remote sensing datasets, Advanced Microwave Scattering Radiometer - 2 and Soil Moisture Active Passive satellites sensors. The study is focused on two crops, namely rice and wheat for the Indo-Gangetic basin, India, having a dynamic crop and soil type and land use land cover. A total of 21 rice crop and 23 wheat crop locations are chosen from the states of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar falling in the basin. The root zone soil moisture information is derived by estimating soil wetness index from surface soil moisture at 10 and 40 cm depths using a recursive exponential filter. The soil wetness index based algorithm is implementable even in the absence of ground information for a basin level study. The reference soil moisture dataset is obtained from the Global Land Database Assimilation System - NOAH at 10 and 40 cm depth. The research has also demonstrated significant potential of GLDAS-NOAH soil moisture data in the absence of ground (in-situ) soil moisture data. Of the various factors affecting surface and root zone soil moisture, this work evaluates the control of soil constituents on root zone soil moisture. The Spearman rank correlation coefficient is estimated for characteristic time delay with sand, silt and clay percentage at different locations. Coupling between and trends of surface and root zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crop locations are studied. The accuracy of estimated soil wetness index at 10 and 40 cm from two different satellite sensors at two different acquisition times (ascending and descending passes) is investigated by calculating the coefficient of determination, mean absolute error and mean biased error. This work highlights the significant difference in surface soil moisture estimation by two satellite sensors to derive root zone soil moisture for rice and wheat crops. Coefficient of determination is more (similar to 0.9) for SMAP derived soil wetness index whereas it is lower (similar to 0.65) for AMSR-2 derived soil wetness index for both crops. Characteristic time delay variation is observed at two different times and at both the depths, with characteristic time delay increasing with depth. Also, at the descending pass characteristic time delay is lower as compared to the ascending pass. A strong relationship between root zone soil moisture and soil texture is observed. For rice crop, a positive correlation with sand and clay is observed for Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar locations having loam and sandy loam as the major soil class. And, for wheat locations, a positive correlation is observed for silt and clay for Uttar Pradesh locations and sand for Madhya Pradesh locations having loam and clay (light) soil texture. This work delivers essential information in understanding sustainable irrigation scheduling and increasing irrigation potential for rice and wheat crop locations. Having the knowledge of all the factors influencing crop cultivation and the derived root zone soil moisture, crop production can be optimized.},

A field experiment was carried out in a Typic Haplustept soil of New Delhi, India to study the effect of permanent beds on soil hydro-physical properties, root growth, nitrogen uptake, and system productivity of irrigated rice-wheat rotation. Results revealed that direct-seeded rice followed by wheat on permanent beds irrigated at different soil water tensions (field capacity, 20 and 40 kPa) reflected a significant variation in soil hydro-physical properties, reduced total nitrogen uptake, contribution by different plant parts, and N use efficiency compared to wheat after flooded transplanted rice system. Rice root weight density at flowering was also significantly low at 0-15 cm depth but higher at 15-60 cm depth in dry-seeded rice on beds. System productivity of rice-wheat rotation was 25-33\% lower in permanent beds compared to flooded transplanted system.

The study was performed to provide a scientific basis for spring maize planting and environmental protection in this area. The four treatments were non-mulching (CK), plastic film-mulching during the growth period (PM1), plastic film-mulching during the fallow period (PM2), and straw-mulching (JM). After 13 years of continuous application, the yield of spring maize, the nitrogen uptake by plants, and the nitrate nitrogen content at the harvest stage were measured. The results revealed that soil moisture content and water storage capacity of the three soil-mulching treatments were all higher than those of the non-mulching treatment. Soil water storage at a depth of 0-300 cm in the JM, PM1 and PM2 treatments was increased by 11.8\%, 10.6\% and 8.8\%, respectively, compared with the CK treatment. Compared with the CK treatment, the mulching treatments significantly increased the aboveground biomass and grain yield of spring maize. The yield enhancement effect of the PM1 treatment was the most significant, with a yield of 1.1 Mg ha(-1) and an increase of 26.72\%. In addition to the JM treatment, the accumulation of soil nitrate at a depth of 0-300 cm in the PM1 and PM2 treatments was less than that of the CK treatment, but the largest increase in soil nitrate (80.20\% in the JM treatment) was observed at a depth of 0-100 cm. The results suggest that in the rainfed agriculture in the southern Loess Plateau, mulching cultivation can effectively increase the soil moisture content and water storage capacity. PM1, and PM2 treatments could significantly reduce the content and accumulation of nitrate nitrogen in the deeper soil profile, and the three mulching measures could slow down the deep accumulation of soil nitrate nitrogen to a certain extent.},

The indigenous K supply (zero K application) maintained an average grain yield of 7.0 t ha(-1) per year, but the year-to-year variation was large. Application of K significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased the average grain yields by 15.1 and 13.8\% in the 113 and 225 kg K2O ha(-1) treatments, respectively, over the experimental period. The mean K recovery efficiency, K agronomic efficiency, and K partial factor productivity decreased from 37.3 to 28.5\%, 10.8 to 4.9 kg kg(-1), and 86.8 to 43.1 kg kg(-1) when the K application rate increased from 113 to 225 kg 1(20 ha(-1). The effect of K application was larger on stover K concentrations than grain K concentrations. In the top 100 cm of the soil profile, excessive or non-synchronized K application significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) increased the leaching of exchangeable K in comparison with the control, but K application had little effect on soil non-exchangeable K and total K. K fertilizer, therefore, plays an important role in increasing grain yields in China, but the K application rate can be reduced if farmers return stover to the soil and make full use of K below the soil surface.

RLD of all varieties except SL 88 116 under irrigation were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) greater (15-63\%) than under rain-fed conditions. The rain-fed cane yield showed a significant (P {\textless} 0.05) positive correlation with RLD in the middle soil layer. Varieties with higher root length densities in the 30-60 cm soil layer survive better during significant water deficit periods in the top soil layer (0-30 cm), and such varieties produce high sugarcane yields in the rain-fed environments of Sri Lanka.},

The treatments consisted of lime, lime + PG, PG, and control (without corrective application) with four fertilization rates.

This could reduce soil fertility and crop productivity in the long run. A 20-year field experiment was conducted to 1) assess the effect of inorganic and organic nutrient sources on yield and yield trends of both winter wheat and maize, 2) monitor the changes in soil organic matter content under continuous wheat-maize cropping with different soil fertility management schemes, and 3) identify reasons for yield trends observed in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu Province, over a 20-year period. There were eight treatments applied to both wheat and maize seasons: a control treatment (C); three inorganic fertilizers, that is, nitrogen (N), nitrogen and phosphorus (NP), and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (NPK); and addition of farmyard manure (FYM) to these four treatments, that is, M, MN, MNP, and MNPK. At the end of the experiment the MN, MNP, and MNPK treatments had the highest yields, about 7 t wheat ha(-1) and 7.5 t maize ha(-1), with each about 1 t ha(-1) more than the NPK treatments. Over 20 years with FYM soil organic matter increased by 80\% compared to only 10\% with NPK, which explained yield increases. However, from an environmental and agronomic perspective, manure application was not a superior strategy to NPK fertilizers. AA If manure was to be applied, though, it would be best applied to the wheat crop, which showed a better response than maize.},

Then, considering that the crop is moderately sensitive to soil salinity, the model is tested to predict the salt distribution around a buried emitter, when two different water qualities (i.e.electrical conductivity of 1.0 and 4.0 dS m(-1)) are used during the growing season (treatments T1 and T2). Finally, the soil volume in which salt accumulates is distinguished by the model for the two treatments, for which the respective yields are not significantly different. The results showed that in the root zone, simulated and measured soil water content (SWC) are fairly close. HYDRUS-2D well enough predicts the average salt concentration in the soil and evaluates the dynamic of mass-conservative solutes around buried emitters. In both treatments, the salt concentration resulted in an increase in the wetting bulb, with a maximum located towards the edge of the wetting bulb and near the soil surface.

	abstract = {Lake fluctuations in river-lake-basin (RLB) systems are highly complex because of the significant interactions of various hydrological variables. Clarifying these interactions would be helpful for understanding the physical mechanisms of lake fluctuations and improving responses to extreme hydrological events (i.e., drought or flood). Though numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the flow between rivers and lakes (river-lake interaction), research on the hydrological processes between a lake and its surrounding basin (lake-basin interaction) remains rare. This study investigates lake-basin interactions by examining the changes in the water distribution between the land and a lake with an examination of the Poyang Lake region, China. Specifically, this study first estimates water storage by employing the water balance model. Then, the spatial and temporal correlations between the lake area and soil moisture are examined to capture the lake-land interaction. The results show that the region's annual water storage has decreased in recent decades and varies in different months. Specifically, more water in the region is stored in the lake before July, and increasing amounts of water are held on land after that. Spatially, soil moisture is low in the region near the lake in summer because of the high radiation of water reflectance, which enhances evapotranspiration. By contrast, soil moisture is high in other seasons because of the flow from top to bottom. It can be concluded that soil moisture could mitigate the change in water storage due to the shrinkage of Poyang Lake, which is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variabilities. The results of this study help elucidate the dynamics and distribution of water resources in similar RLB systems, support water management and promote local sustainable development.},

Sensitivity experiments were performed with extreme wet and dry initial soil moisture conditions for both the 1984 wet monsoon year and the 1989 dry year. The MM5-VIC model reproduced the key features of NAMS in 1984 and 1989 especially over northwestern Mexico. Our modeling results indicate that the land surface has memory of the initial soil wetness prescribed at the onset of the monsoon that persists over most of the region well into the monsoon season ( e. g. until August). However, in contrast to the classical thermal contrast concept, where wetter soils lead to cooler surface temperatures, less land-sea thermal contrast, weaker monsoon circulations and less precipitation, the coupled model consistently demonstrated a positive soil moisture - precipitation feedback. Specifically, anomalously wet pre-monsoon soil moisture always lead to enhanced monsoon precipitation, and the reverse was also true. Both the large-scale circulation change and local land-atmospheric interactions in response to pre-monsoon soil moisture anomalies play important roles in the coupled model's positive soil moisture - monsoon precipitation feedback. However, the former may be sensitive to the strength and location of the thermal anomalies, thus leaving open the possibility of both positive and negative soil moisture - precipitation feedbacks. Furthermore, our use of a regional model with prescribed large-scale circulation at the model boundaries leaves open the possibility that the model behavior may, to some extent, reflect its limited ability to adjust its large-scale circulation to the regional thermal changes.},

At six sites along the chronosequence (soil age: 6, 60, 150, 500, 12,000 and 120,000 years old), we measured rates of leaf R (D), R (L) (using Kok method), light-saturated CO2 assimilation rates (A), leaf mass per unit area (M (A)), and concentrations of leaf nitrogen ([N]), phosphorus ([P]), soluble sugars and starch. The chronosequence was characterised by decreasing R (D), R (L) and A, reduced [N] and [P] and increasing M (A) as soil age increased. Light inhibition of R occurred across the chronosequence (mean inhibition = 16 \%), resulting in ratios of R (L):A being lower than for R (D):A. Importantly, the degree of light inhibition differed across the chronosequence, being lowest at young sites and highest at old sites. This resulted in R (L):A ratios being relatively constant across the chronosequence, whereas R (D):A ratios increased with increasing soil age. Log-log R-A-M (A)-[N] relationships remained constant along the chronosequence. By contrast, relationships linking rates of leaf R to [P] differed among leaves with low vs high [N]:[P] ratios. Slopes of log-log bivariate relationships linking R (L) to A, M (A), [N] and [P] were steeper than that for R (D).

	abstract = {Reduction of soil tillage is of paramount importance for agricultural soil preservation. However, it is often accompanied by yield reduction and weed management problems. In this perspective, cover crops could play an important role to alleviate weed infestation and sustain yield. In this study, the results from a three-year experiment of cover crop cultivation in different soil tillage treatments is presented, together with results from DayCent simulations on the long term evolution of soil organic carbon and total nitrogen. Eight cover crop treatments were set up as subtreatments in a long term experiment in Switzerland. Cover crops were cultivated for a short two-month period between two winter wheats. Substantial differences in cover crop growth were observed depending on cover crop species. In all tillage treatments, high cover crop biomass production allowed to supress weed biomass compared to the no cover crop control. Wheat grain yield was higher in the minimum tillage than in the plough treatment. In the no till treatment, wheat yield was notably low, except in the field pea treatments, where wheat yield reached values similar to that observed in the plough and minimum tillage treatments. In addition, these differences in biomass production translated into important differences in nutrient inputs, and even in soil nutrient concentration in some cases. Long term simulations showed that cover crop cultivation could increase drastically soil organic carbon and total nitrogen, especially in reduced tillage treatments. Altogether, these results demonstrated that the Presence of a well-developed cover crop, even for only two months, allows to sustain wheat yield in a no till treatment. It impacts also soil fertility and nutrient cycling. This study shows that an accurate use and management of cover crops, in interaction with tillage reduction, could maintain yield and improve soil fertility in the long term.},

	abstract = {A field experiment was conducted in Cullman, AL, to evaluate the effects of three different rollers/crimpers on the termination of a rye (Secale cereale L) winter cover crop, soil moisture, and yield of sweet corn (Zen mays saccharata L.) in a no-till system. The following roller types were tested: a straight bar roller, a smooth roller with crimper, and a two-stage roller. These rollers were tested at operating speeds of 3.2 km h(-1) and 6.4 km.h(-1). The three rollers/crimpers were compared with a smooth drum roller (no crimping bars) plus glyphosate applied at rate 1.0 kg.ha(-1) used as a control. Rye termination dates were selected to be 3 weeks before the recommended sweet corn planting date, which is in the beginning of May for this region. Data indicate that at 3 weeks after rolling for all seasons (2006-2008), 100\% rye termination was reached with the smooth drum roller and glyphosate. Two weeks after rolling, average rye termination rates by rollers/crimpers alone were 54.6\%, 30.0\%, and 50.4\% in 2006, 2007, and 2008, respectively. Three weeks after rolling, rye termination rates increased only by approximate to 10\% compared with 2 weeks after rolling. These termination levels were below the recommended rate of 90\% termination necessary for planting a cash crop into the cover residue. Lower rye termination was probably caused by rolling the rye in an early growth stage (flowering stage). The rollers' operating speed did not influence rye termination rates. Similarly, roller type did not affect soil moisture during the first and second week after rolling. Applying glyphosate with rolling did not increase yield of sweet corn in any of the three growing seasons, and in 2006, sweet corn yield was lower compared with the roller alone treatments. These results are important to vegetable organic systems, in which use of herbicides is not allowed. No significant difference in sweet corn yield was found between operating speeds of 3.2 km.h(-1) vs. 6.4 km.h(-1) and between the assigned treatments in all growing seasons. However, significant differences in sweet corn yield were detected between the years, most likely as a result of different weather patterns. The lowest sweet corn yield of 3513 kg.ha(-1) was reported in 2007 as a result of severe drought in spring and summer of 2007. The highest yield of 15,613 kg-ha(-1) was recorded in 2006. In 2008, the yield was 10,158 kg-ha(-1). Although the different roller designs were not as effective in ending the rye cover crop compared with the glyphosate treatment, sweet corn yields were unaffected. Multiple rolling operations over the same area could be useful if greater rye termination levels are required without the use of a herbicide, but this recommendation should be tested experimentally in more detail.},

The fully-coupled subsurface-land surface model TerrSysMP including variably saturated groundwater dynamics is used in this work. We test and compare five data assimilation methodologies for assimilating groundwater level data via the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to improve root zone soil moisture estimation with TerrSysMP. Groundwater level data are assimilated in the form of pressure head or soil moisture (set equal to porosity in the saturated zone) to update state vectors. In the five assimilation methodologies, the state vector contains either (i) pressure head, or (ii) log-transformed pressure head, or (iii) soil moisture, or (iv) pressure head for the saturated zone only, or (v) a combination of pressure head and soil moisture, pressure head for the saturated zone and soil moisture for the unsaturated zone. These methodologies are evaluated in synthetic experiments which are performed for different climate conditions, soil types and plant functional types to simulate various root zone soil moisture distributions and groundwater levels. The results demonstrate that EnKF cannot properly handle strongly skewed pressure distributions which are caused by extreme negative pressure heads in the unsaturated zone during dry periods. This problem can only be alleviated by methodology (iii), (iv) and (v). The last approach gives the best results and avoids unphysical updates related to strongly skewed pressure heads in the unsaturated zone. If groundwater level data are assimilated by methodology (iii), EnKF fails to update the state vector containing the soil moisture values if for (almost) all the realizations the observation does not bring significant new information. Synthetic experiments for the joint assimilation of groundwater levels and surface soil moisture support methodology (v) and show great potential for improving the representation of root zone soil moisture.},

(0, 10, 20, and 30 Mg ha(-1) on fresh weight basis) and three tillage practices (No puddling, puddling, and soil compaction). From wet season of 1997, however, three tillage practices were replaced with three levels of nitrogen (N) and potassium (K) to rice (33, 66, and 100\% of recommended) and 66\% of recommended N, phosphorus (P), and K to wheat. Phosphorus was totally omitted for the rice crop. The recommended N and K for rice was 90 and 40kg ha(-1), whereas the recommendations for N, P, and K for wheat were 120, 90 and 30kg ha(-1). Organic amendments are known to improve soil productivity under rice-wheat cropping by improving physical conditions and nutrient status of the soil, but their availability is restricted. There is a need to identify locally available and cost-effective organic materials that have minimal alternate uses as fodder and fuel. We evaluated Lantana camara L. residues, a fast-growing weed in nearby wastelands, as a potential soil organic amendment. Among the different fractions of K, nonexchangeable K was dominant followed by exchangeable and water soluble K. The incorporation of lantana (10 to 30 Mg ha(-1)) over the last 12years has resulted in a significant build-up of all the K fractions, the maximum being in water-soluble K (10 to 32\%) followed by exchangeable K (18 to 27\%) and least in nonexchangeable K (5 to 7\%) over no lantana incorporation. The increasing levels of these two inputs significantly and consistently increased ammonium acetate (NH4OAc)- extracted K (available K) content in soil and also resulted in significantly higher accumulation of K by the crops during the years of experimentation. Among different K fractions, exchangeable K was observed to be the most important K fraction contributing towards wheat and rice yields as well as K accumulation by wheat and rice. Stepwise multiple regression equations indicated that exchangeable K was the most important variable contributing towards total variation in grain yield and K accumulation by wheat or rice.},

	abstract = {Transgenic glyphosate-resistant (GR) soybean (Glycine max L. Merr.) is cultivated throughout the United States. Soybean growth is influenced by the presence of weeds, although managing non-crop vegetation can potentially impact soil arthropods, which are being increasingly recognized for their impacts on soil health, plant growth, and above-ground trophic interactions. We investigated how weed management (weedy controls, hand-weeded, glyphosate herbicide) and soil insecticide (chlorpyrifos) application affected densities of soil arthropods, soil nutrient availability, soybean growth and yield, and densities of an above-ground herbivore on sandy and clayey soils for two consecutive growing seasons. The soil insecticide treatment was intended to lower densities of subterranean arthropods to gain insight into how their presence influenced other factors, although their densities were primarily reduced the first year of the study. Surprisingly, weed management and soil insecticide use had virtually no interactive effects on any response. Weed presence had a positive effect on soil K at the sandy site and on nodule density per unit root. Negative effects of weed management on plant growth and aphids were related to the presence of weeds rather than herbicide use. Reduced soybean aphid density (at the clayey site) and soil P availability (at the sandy site) were associated with insecticide treated plots. Conversely, several measures of plant productivity, including number of nodules per unit root, and root and shoot biomass increased in + insecticide plots compared to other treatments, although effect strength depended on year and location. Collembola were the dominant soil microarthropod, and their densities in 2012 were negatively associated with nodule numbers in 2013. One explanatory hypothesis is that increased plant growth in plots treated with insecticide was caused by altered soil arthropod-microorganism interactions, possibly affecting arbuscular mycorrhizae function. This work highlights the importance of management decisions that affect soil arthropods in annual legume production systems.},

In this article, the relationships between vegetation indices (VIs) and in situ soil moisture under maize and soybean canopies were analysed using close-range reflectance data acquired at a rainfed cropland site in the US Corn Belt. Because of the deep rooting depths of maize plants, maize-based VIs exhibited significant correlations with soil moisture at a depth of 100 cm (P {\textless} 0.01) and kept soil moisture memory for a long period of time (45 days). Among the VIs applied to maize, the chrolophyll red-edge index (CIred-edge) correlated best with the concurrent soil moisture at 100 cm depth (P {\textless} 0.01) for up to 20 day lag periods. The same index showed a significant correlation with soil moisture at a 50 cm depth for lag periods from 10 (P {\textless} 0.05) to 60 days (P {\textless} 0.01). VIs applied to soybean resulted in statistically significant correlations with soil moisture at the shallower 10 and 25 cm depths, and the correlation coefficients declined with increasing depths. As opposed to maize, soybean held a shorter soil moisture memory as the correlations for all VIs versus soil moisture at 10 cm depth were strongest for the 5 day lag period. Wide dynamic range VI and normalized difference VI performed better in characterizing soil moisture at the 10 and 25 cm depths under soybean canopies when compared with enhanced VI and CIred-edge.},

This study presents a new variational land system used to assimilate AMSR-E brightness temperature of vertical polarization of 6.9 GHz and 18.7 GHz. The system consists of a land surface model (LSM) used to calculate surface fluxes and soil moisture, a radiative transfer model (RTM) to estimate the microwave brightness temperature, and an optimization scheme to search for optimal values of soil moisture by minimizing the difference between modeled and observed brightness temperature. The LSM is an improved simple biosphere model for sparse vegetation modeling and the RTM is a Q-h model that can account for the effects of surface roughness and vegetation. Several parameters in the LSM and RTM can significantly affect the outputs of the land data assimilation system but their values are either highly variable or unavailable. To solve this problem, we developed a dual-pass assimilation technique. Pass 1 inversely estimates the optimal values of the model parameters with long-term (similar to months) forcing data and brightness temperature data, while Pass 2 estimates the near-surface soil moisture in a daily assimilation cycle. This system is driven by well-established reanalysis data and global data sets of leaf area index, precipitation, and surface radiation, and was tested at a CEOP (Coordinate Enhanced Observing Period) reference site on the Tibetan Plateau. The system not only detected the effect of precipitation events that were missing in the forcing data, but also led to a significant improvement in modeling of the surface energy budget.},

	abstract = {A 4-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of biochar amendment on the net greenhouse gas emission (NGHGE), greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), soil fertility and crop yield in a typical double rice cropping system in the central subtropics of China, from April 2012 to April 2016. Three biochar treatments were studied in this experiment, with application rates of 0, 24 and 48 t ha(-1) (named CK, LB and HB, respectively) using straw-derived biochar applied once at the beginning of the experiment. In each treatment, the fluxes of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and soil heterotrophic respiration (Rh) were measured using a static chamber/gas chromatography method. Major soil fertility properties were also determined throughout the experimental period. Biochar amendment was found to persistently decrease annual total CH4 emissions by 20 to 51\% in the four years, but increased the annual total N2O emissions and Rh by 150 to 190\% and 2 to 19\% in the first year and the following three years, respectively. On a 4-year average, biochar addition significantly reduced annual NGHGE and GHGI by 156 to 264\% and 159 to 278\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), with much higher reduction in the first year than those in the following three years (916 to 1911\% vs 24 to 51\%) due to soil carbon sequestration from biochar addition in the first year. The reduction of NGHGE and GHGI was mainly caused by the decrease of CH4 emissions (71 to 74\% contribution), and the increase of soil carbon sequestration (25 to 29\% contribution) in biochar treatments. Biochar amendment also significantly and persistently increased soil pH, total organic carbon (TOC), total nitrogen (TSN), and total phosphorus (TSP) by 6 to 14\%, 33 to 61\%, 11 to 15\%, and 9 to 12\%, respectively (p {\textless} 0.05), in the four years. Significant increases (p {\textless} 0.05) of microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen contents were found only in the first year after biochar amendment. Soil pH was also increased significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) with biochar amendment, but showed a declining trend in the four years. Annual grain yields for the biochar treatments were enhanced by 1 to 13\%, with an average of 4 to 7\% in the four years, compared to CK (p = 0.07-0.26). Compared to the LB treatment, the HB treatment significantly decreased average NGHGE and GHGI, and significantly increased average soil pH value and TOC content, but there was no significantly difference in average TSN, TSP, and yield between LB and HB treatments (p {\textless} 0.05). The gross margin analysis by considering the profit from rice grain, gain for NGHGE, and cost for biochar indicated that the economical profit for the LB treatment might be higher than that for the CK and HB treatments. Our results suggest that addition of biochar at 24 t ha(-1) can be regarded as a consistently effective and economic measure for greenhouse gas emission mitigation, and soil fertility improvement, in the double rice cropping system.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture variability and the depth of water stored in the arable layer of the soil are important topics in agricultural research and rangeland management. In this study, we use the distributed rainfall-runoff (DR2) model to perform a detailed mapping of topsoil moisture status (SMS) in a mountain Mediterranean catchment. This model, previously tested in the same study area against the Palmer Z-index, is run at monthly scale for the current scenario of land uses and under three scenarios that combine the land abandonment and the application of the new common agricultural policy (CAP) of the European Union. Under the current conditions, runoff yield is scarce and presents a high spatial variability when monthly rainfall intensity and depth are low, and infiltration processes mainly lead to water storage in the soil. When rainfall intensity is high, runoff accumulation along the hillslopes controls the depth of available water in the soil, and SMS is more homogeneous. On average, scrublands and pasture have the wettest values, crops of winter cereal and abandoned fields have intermediate conditions, and areas of bare soil and forest have the driest conditions all the year around. The abandonment and no revegetation of the low productive fields located in steep areas and the collapse of their landscape linear elements (LLEs) produce not only an increase of 2.3 \% of the overall SMS in the catchment in comparison with the current scenario but also an increment of the effective runoff that cross the cultivated areas of the lowlands and the runoff depth that reach the wetlands, increasing the soil erosion risk and compromising the conservation of the lakes. When the new green areas of the CAP are installed in the upper part of the fields of the lowlands and around the lakes, the runoff depth and thus siltation risk clearly decreases but also SMS decreases 1.7 and 1.1 \% considering the current land uses and adding revegetation practices in the abandoned fields, respectively. Hence, a management scenario where: (1) abandoned fields are covered with a dense cover of shrubs, (2) the LLEs are preserved, (3) the green areas of the PAC are created, and (4) runoff harvesting practices are applied to partially compensate the water deficit, will help to preserve the humidity of the soil and will be of interest to keep the agricultural land use around the protected lakes of the study area.},

	abstract = {Monitoring sea surface salinity (SSS) is important for understanding and forecasting the ocean circulation. It is even crucial in the context of the intensification of the water cycle. Until recently, SSS was one of the less observed essential ocean variables. Only sparse in situ observations, mostly closer to 5 m depth than the surface, were available to estimate the SSS. The recent satellite ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), NASA Aquarius SAC-D and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) missions have made it possible for the first time to measure SSS from space and can bring a valuable additional constraint to control the model salinity. Nevertheless, satellite SSS still contains some residual biases that must be removed prior to bias correction and data assimilation. One of the major challenges of this study is to estimate the SSS bias and a suitable observation error for the data assimilation system. It was made possible by modifying a 3D-Var bias correction scheme and by using the analysis of the residuals and errors with an adapted statistical technique. This article presents the design and the analysis of an observing system experiment (OSE) conducted with the 0.25 degrees resolution Mercator Ocean global analysis and forecasting system during the El Nino 2015/16 event. The SSS data assimilation constrains the model to be closer to the near-surface salinity observations in a coherent way with the other data sets already routinely assimilated in an operational context. This also shows that the overestimation of E-P is corrected by data assimilation through salting in regions where precipitations are higher. Globally, the SMOS SSS assimilation has a positive impact in salinity over the top 30 m. Comparisons to independent salinity data sets show a small but positive impact and corroborate the fact that the impact of SMOS SSS assimilation is larger in the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) regions. There is little impact on the sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) error statistics. Nevertheless, the SSH seems to be impacted by the tropical instability wave (TIW) propagation, itself linked to changes in barrier layer thickness (BLT). Finally, this study helped us to progress in the understanding of the biases and errors that can degrade the SMOS SSS data assimilation performance.},

During 2008-2009 year, yield attributes and rice yield were greater in NPK plots as compared to the green-leaf manured ones. However, in the third year, green leaf manuring (except that of Alnus) surpassed even the recommended N-P2O5-K2O treatment in terms of dry matter production and yield; better response was however observed with Erythrina. The soil available N after final harvest increased by ca. 14-20 \% in Alnus and Erythrina treated plots as compared to the control. Over all, it could be said that management of plant residues can have long-term implications apart from the desired maintenance of soil organic matter and improving crop yield.},

Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) can flexibly monitor land surfaces with thermal and optical imagery at very high spatial resolution (meter level, VHR) for most weather conditions. We modified the temperature-vegetation triangle approach to transfer it from satellite to UAS remote sensing. To consider the effects of the limited coverage of UAS mapping, theoretical dry/wet edges were introduced. The new method was tested on a bioenergy willow short rotation coppice site during growing seasons of 2016 and 2017. We demonstrated that by incorporating surface roughness parameters from the structure-from-motion in the interpretation of the measured land surface-atmosphere temperature gradients, the estimates of SM significantly improved. The correlation coefficient between estimated and measured SM increased from not significant to 0.69 and the root mean square deviation decreased from 0.045 m(3).m(-3) to 0.025 m(3).m(-3) when considering temporal dynamics of surface roughness in the approach. The estimated SM correlated better with in-situ root-zone SM (15-30 cm) than with surface SM (0-5 cm) which is an important advantage over alternative remote sensing methods to estimate SM. The optimal spatial resolution of the triangle approach was found to be around 1.5 m, i.e. similar to the length scale of tree-crowns. This study highlights the importance of considering the 3-D fine scale canopy structure, when addressing the links between surface temperature and SM patterns via surface energy balances. Our methodology can be applied to operationally monitor VHR root-zone SM from UAS in agricultural and natural ecosystems.},

The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) has been extensively applied to assimilate the SM observations into numerical weather predication models. Implementation of EnKF requires the observations and model simulations to be Gaussian distributed and not biased from each other. In this letter, we tested the impacts of three bias-correction methods on effectiveness of assimilating SMAP retrievals into the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration-National Centers for Environmental Prediction Global Forecast System (GFS). They are: 1) global cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching with only one CDF for all grids and time series; 2) monthly CDF matching with one CDF for each grid; 3) the linear transformation technique that matches monthly mean and standard deviation of the SMAP retrievals and model simulations for each grid; and 4) assimilating SMAP SM data into GFS without any bias-correction procedure. With respect to the global land data assimilation (DA) system precipitation product, the results demonstrate that the effectiveness of assimilating SMAP retrievals into GFS is significantly impacted by the bias-correction methods. Relative to other DA cases, the monthly CDF matching produces the best precipitation forecast performance. Improvements of the three-hourly GFS precipitation prediction with SMAP assimilation using the monthly CDF matching can reach to 8\% and 10\% in sparsely and densely vegetated areas, respectively, and marginally positive in medium vegetation areas. Based on these results, assimilating SMAP retrievals into the GFS with the EnKF algorithm using the monthly CDF matching method is suggested for enhancing accuracy of the precipitation forecasts.},

However, the highest values of the Met Office Fire Severity Index (MOFSI, based on the Canadian Forest Fire Weather Index System) occur in the height of summer, thus successfully predicting extreme fire weather conditions, but failing to predict when the majority of real fires occur. Here we illustrate this discrepancy with data from the English Peak District, and present an alternative model which calculates a proposed shrub fire index (SFI) and compares it with randomly generated numbers to simulate fire occurrence. The major peaks in the SFI dynamics occur in spring, reflecting the effect of drought stress on shrubs caused by damaged leaf cuticles during winter and the lack of resources to alleviate the damage during the pre-green-up period. The model presented here shows a reasonable performance in reproducing the seasonal distribution of wild fire occurrence, and may therefore prove helpful for future development of a fire prediction system designed specifically for British conditions. An effective wildfire prediction system will have great value for increasing the preparedness of land managers, National Park Authority staff and the Fire and Rescue Services. A weather index that accurately predicts the fuel moisture content of the dominant shrubs will also be valuable to land managers who use prescribed fire for vegetation management.},

Continuous use of FYM, WS and GM in conjunction with fertilizers increased the fertility status, NPK uptake, and yield of pearl millet and wheat crops. The soil reaction and soluble salts were found invariant under different treatments after the harvest of wheat. Among the organic materials, FYM resulted in highest available N (220.5 kg/ha), P (21.0 kg/ha) and K (333.8 kg/ha) in soil, and yielded highest grain yield of pearl millet (3142 kg/ha) and wheat (5452 kg/ha). These yields were not different with the yields obtained with the application of chemical fertilizer alone. Continuous application of FYM to meet 50\% N requirement of pearl miller resulted in highest increase in plant height, dry matter accumulation, number of grains per earhead/spike and test weight of both the crops as compared to other treatments. Study suggests that long term integrated use of chemical fertilizers and organic materials has great potential for improving soil productivity and achieving higher crop productivity under pearl millet-wheat cropping system in arid and semi-arid climatic conditions.},

	abstract = {Water determines the success of coffee farming, since it influences the phenology of the plant and, consequently, its productivity, product quality and commercial viability. The Least Limiting Water Range (LLWR) associated with the monitoring of soil water content (theta) distinguishes management systems as to their effectiveness in supplying water to plants. The need for developing better management systems -in Brazilian rainfed farming that promote water uptake by coffee plant radicular systems at lower soil depths where water is more available, inspired this study. This work had as an objective to evaluate the availability of water in soil through LLWR limits in association with leaf water potential, as well as growth and yield of coffee plants, in the Cerrado region of Southeastern Brazil over 4 years. The management systems evaluated were: CV-0 (conventional management with coffee interrow maintained with bare soil); G-28 (conservation management, with maintenance of Brachiaria in interrow, ridging and additional application of 28 Mg ha(-1) gypsum applied in the rows) and G-7 (same as G-28, except for an additional application of 7 Mg ha(-1) of gypsum). theta was monitored every 15 days. Critical moisture for coffee crop in each phenological stage was added as the lowest limit of LLWR. In all evaluated management systems, theta was below the critical moisture as measured at the soil depths of 0.20 m and 0.60 m. At 1.00 m depth in the CV-0 management system, the greatest value of theta was found, which caused the assumption of smaller water uptake. Regardless of the management adopted, the leaf water potential reached -1.16 MPa in August 2010, but that did not cause water stress high enough to reduce productivity. At 0.60 m depth, the lowest value for theta between rows was observed for the G-28 management system. Plants showed a more accentuated initial growth in the CV-0 management system. Each management system showed distinct behavior regarding productivity of the evaluated crops: in 2011, CV-0 had the highest productivity, but, in 2012, productivity was greater for G-7 and G-28.},

In semi-arid regions, due to limited near-surface observational data and large errors in large-scale parameters obtained by the remote sensing method, there exist uncertainties in land surface parameters, which can cause large offsets between the simulated results of land-surface process models and the observational data for the soil moisture. In this study, observational data from the Semi-Arid Climate Observatory and Laboratory (SACOL) station in the semi-arid loess plateau of China were divided into three datasets: summer, autumn, and summer-autumn. By combing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the land-surface process model SHAW (Simultaneous Heat and Water), the soil and vegetation parameters that are related to the soil moisture but difficult to obtain by observations are optimized using three datasets. On this basis, the SHAW model was run with the optimized parameters to simulate the characteristics of the land-surface process in the semi-arid loess plateau. Simultaneously, the default SHAW model was run with the same atmospheric forcing as a comparison test. Simulation results revealed the following: parameters optimized by the particle swarm optimization algorithm in all simulation tests improved simulations of the soil moisture and latent heat flux; differences between simulated results and observational data are clearly reduced, but simulation tests involving the adoption of optimized parameters cannot simultaneously improve the simulation results for the net radiation, sensible heat flux, and soil temperature. Optimized soil and vegetation parameters based on different datasets have the same order of magnitude but are not identical; soil parameters only vary to a small degree, but the variation range of vegetation parameters is large.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a consideration for soil conservation, agricultural production and climate modelling. This article presents a simple method for estimating soil moisture storage under water stress and storage depletion conditions. The method is driven by the common agro-hydrologic variables of precipitation (PPT), irrigation (IRR) and evapotranspiration (ET). The proposed method is successfully tested for the 152 000 km(2) floodplain region of Hai River Basin using 48 consecutive months (2003-2006) of data. Soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system/Noah land surface model are validated with ground-truth data from 102 soil moisture monitoring sites. The validated soil moisture is used in combination with in situ groundwater data to quantify total water storage change (TWSC) in the region. The estimated storage change is in turn compared with gravity recovery and climate experiment-derived TWSC for the study area. The soil moisture and TWSC terms show favourable agreements, with discrepancies of {\textless} 10\% on the average. While there is no consistent seasonal trend in soil moisture, TWSC shows a strong seasonality. It is low in spring and high in summer. This trend corresponds with the IRR-PPT season in the study area. Change in groundwater and total water storage indicates storage depletion in the basin. Storage depletion in the region is driven mainly by groundwater IRR and ET loss. Despite the low PPT and high ET, there is narrowing seasonal trend in soil moisture. This is achieved at the expense of groundwater storage. IRR pumping has induced extensive groundwater depletion in the basin. It is therefore vital to develop cultivation strategies that aim at limiting IRR pumping and ET loss. Water management practices that not only reduce waste but also ensure high productivity and ecological sustainability could also mitigate storage depletion in the region. These measures could reduce further not only the seasonal trend in soil moisture but also that in groundwater storage. Copyright. (C) 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a core ecohydrological element in the middle-high latitude frozen area, which occupies approximately 30\% of the global land area. The Sanjiang Plain, an important commercial grain production area, is the largest swampy low plain in a middle-high latitude frozen area in China. However, no published studies on this region have clarified the accuracy of soil moisture data from in-situ measurements; the performance of ecohydrological models are also unknown. In this study, we compared the ability of the SMAP product, a RSDTVGM model, and two self-erected soil moisture monitoring stations to capture soil moisture information in the Sanjiang Plain by using the Triple Collocation method. Soil moisture data were collected for 642 continuous days, and the data period was divided into three frozen periods (FT) and two non-frozen (NFT) periods. Valid data supply rates of the three methods were also calculated and compared. From the Triple Collocation method, the root mean square error (RMSE) of the SMAP, model and in-situ monitoring data sets were 0.03, 0.08, and 0.05. The valid data supply rates of the SMAP product in the FT and NFT periods were 27.1\% and 57.5\%, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficient between the SMAP product and the in-situ monitoring dataset was 0.301 for the FT period and 0.557 for the NFT period. The RS-DTVGM model had a data supply rate of 100\%. The Pearson correlation coefficient for this model was 0.101 for the FT period, but reached 0.726 for the NFT period. For the three soil moisture data sets, the accuracy ranking in this middle-high latitude area was SMAP {\textgreater} in-situ monitoring {\textgreater} model simulation. Although neither SMAP nor the RS-DTVGM model could capture the real soil moisture information for the FT period, both could accurately simulate the soil moisture in the NFT period. The results from the RS-DTVGM model demonstrated a closer relationship with in-situ soil moisture measurement data relative to the SMAP method. The in-situ method provided accurate soil moisture data, but its application is limited by high cost. In the future, the data from the three methods should be assimilated together to measure soil moisture data with high accuracy and high spatial and temporal resolution in this important area.},

	abstract = {The phosphorus (P) efficiency of fertilised grazing systems on P deficient soils is often very low. P budgets (P input vs P output) were developed to examine P use in a long-term experiment in which grazing systems were managed with contrasting soil test P concentrations: (i) no P-fertiliser (PO; Olsen P = 2-5 mg/kg), (ii) near-optimum soil P fertility (P1; Olsen P = 10-15 mg/kg), (iii) supra-optimal P fertility (P2; Olsen P = 20-25 mg/kg), or (iv) with variable? fertility. Pastures were grazed with either 9 or 18 sheep/ha. P was exported as liveweight gain in sheep removed from the fields. Fertilised fields accumulated 89-93\% of their P input over the whole P-budgeting period (1994-2006). However, this included P that was contributing to a “build up” in soil fertility (1994-2000). The efficiency of P fertiliser use was better demonstrated by P budgets during a soil P fertility “maintenance” phase (2001-2006) in which P inputs and soil test P concentrations of the grazing system treatments were relatively stable. When the amounts of P associated with the small changes in soil fertility were accounted for, the accumulation of P was 4352 kg P/ha (83-87\% of P inputs) in P1 fields and 87 kg P/ha (88\% of P inputs) in P2 fields over the six-year period. Differences due to stocking rate were relatively small. Audits of the total Pin sheep camp soil and field soil demonstrated that sheep camps were not a major sink for the P that was accumulating in the grazed fields. P was mainly accumulated in soil in the non-camp area of fields when they were fertilised and this was the major reason for low P-balance efficiency. It was concluded that the annual rate of P accumulation in fertilised soil (due mainly to P-sorption reactions) was higher when soil is being maintained at higher extractable-P concentrations. Consequently, strategies that can achieve equivalent pasture production with lower concentrations of extractable-P in the soil should reduce the amount of P fertiliser necessary for high production.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activities have significantly altered global biogeochemical nitrogen (N) cycling leading to major environmental problems such as freshwater eutrophication, biodiversity loss and enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. The soils in the riparian interface between terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems may prevent excess N from entering freshwaters (e.g. via plant uptake, microbial transformations and denitrification). Although these processes are well documented in intensively managed agroecosystems, our understanding of riparian N removal in semi-natural systems remains poor. Our aim was to assess the spatial zoning of soil microbial communities (PLFA), N cycling gene abundance (archaeal and bacterial amoA, nifH, nirK, nirS, nos2), N processing rates and plant N uptake across an extensively sheep grazed riparian area. As expected, soil properties differed greatly across the riparian transect, with significant decreases in organic matter, NH4+, carbon (C) and N content closest to the river ( {\textless}10 m). In addition, different microbial community structures were found along the transect. The abundance of N fixation (nifH) increased with distance from the river ({\textgreater}10m), while ammonia oxidising archaea (AOA) increased in abundance towards the river. N2O emissions rates were limited by C and to a lesser extent by N with greater emissions close to the river. Plant uptake of urea-derived N-15 was high (ca. 55-70\% of that added to the soil) but 30-65\% of the N was potentially lost by denitrification or leaching. Percentage recovered also suggests that the spatial patterning of plant and microbial N removal processes are different across the riparian zone. Our study provides novel insights into the underlying mechanisms controlling the spatial variability of N cycling in semi-natural riparian ecosystems.},

The seedcotton yield and fiber quality with respect to fruiting position under ICMS and CCMS were investigated in 2012 and 2013 in two fields differing in soil fertility. Reduced bolls on fruiting branches 1-10 (FB1-10) and at fruiting position 1-2 (FP1-2) on FB11-15 could not be fully compensated by increased bolls on FB16+ under CCMS, resulting in more seedcotton yield under ICMS relative to that under CCMS. Fiber at majority fruiting positions under CCMS were longer and stronger than those under ICMS, but CCMS increased the contribution of bolls on FB11+ to the cotton yield, which overall resulted in no significant change in fiber length and strength by management system at field level. The number of bolls at FP1-2 on FB1-5 under CCMS while the number of bolls on FB1-5 and at FP1-2 on FB1-5 were not significantly changed by soil fertility, resulting in diminished yield difference in soil fertility among ICMS relative to that of CCMS. The high soil fertility significantly increased seedcotton yield relative to low soil fertility, which was attributed to more number of bolls on FB11+ and higher seedcotton weight per boll at all fruiting positions. High soil fertility field not only recorded superior fiber quality on FB11+, but also increased the contribution of these bolls to the cotton yield relative to those in the low soil fertility field, resulting in no significant change in overall fiber quality among soil fertility. These findings demonstrate that by combining optimal management practices on infertile soils ICMS could minimize the yield differences due to soil fertility without sacrificing fiber quality.},

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is a crucial factor in understanding the hydrological cycle and is essential to many applications in hydrology, ecology and water resources management. However, reliable ET measurements and predictions for a range of temporal and spatial scales are difficult. This study focused on the comparison of ET estimates using a relatively simple model, the Priestley-Taylor (P-T) approach, and the physically based Common Land Model (CLM) using ground and remotely sensed soil moisture data as input. The results from both models were compared directly with hourly eddy covariance measurements at two agricultural field sites during the Soil Moisture-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (SMACEX) in the corn soybean production region in the Upper Midwest, USA. The P-T model showed a significant overestimation of the potential ET compared to the measurements, with a root mean square error (RMSE) between 115 and 130 W m(-2). Actual ET was better predicted by the CLM, with the RMSE ranging between 50 and 75 W m(-2). However, actual ET from the P-T model constrained with a soil moisture dependency parameterization showed improved results when compared to the measurements, with a significantly reduced bias and RMSE values between 60 and 65 W m(-2). This study suggests that even with a simple semi-empirical ET model, similar performance in estimating actual ET for agricultural crops compared to more complex land surface-atmosphere models (i.e. the CLM) can be achieved when constrained with the soil moisture function. This suggests that remote sensing soil moisture estimates from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer - Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) and others such as the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission may be effective alternatives under certain environmental conditions for estimating actual ET of agricultural crops using a fairly simple algorithm.},

The treatments comprised omission of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and zinc, 50\% omission of N, P, and K, absolute control (no nutrient applied) and optimum nutrition (150-26.4-50-15-3 kg/ha of N-P-K-S-Zn). The reduction in the grain yield due to N, P and K omission was 35.0\%, 9.6\% and 3.0\% during the year 2010-11, which further increased to 49\%, 11.5\% and 7.4\% during the year 2011-12, respectively.

	abstract = {As an important surface parameter, surface soil moisture (SSM) plays a significant role in water resources management, crop growth, land degradation, and vegetation coverage as well as global climate change studies. In particular, the triangle model based on the spatial relationship between the land surface temperature (LST) and vegetation index from optical/thermal infrared remote sensing data has been widely used for the estimation of SSM. In the present study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) remote sensing data, including the MOD11A2 LST and MOD13A2 normalised differential vegetation index (NDVI) from July to October, 2008 to 2010, over the source area of the Yellow River (SAYR) in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau, are selected to construct the LST/NDVI triangle space. Two methods based on the triangle space, namely, the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI) method and second order polynomial method, is used to estimate the SSM at the regional scale. Finally, an analysis between the estimated SSM and ground-measured SSM is carried out to explore not only the quality of these two methods in triangle space but also the applicability of these two methods in the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau. In addition, the spatial distribution of SSM in the study area is investigated. The results of the validation of the estimated SSM results using ground-measured data show that the accuracy of the second order polynomial method is significantly higher than that of the TVDI method. The TVDI method root mean square error (RMSE) is 0.072m(3)m(-3), coefficient of determination R-2 is 0.461, and bias is -0.022m(3)m(-3), while the second order polynomial method RMSE is 0.075m(3)m(-3), R-2 is 0.519, and bias is 0.007m(3)m(-3). Moreover, the SSM decreases from west to the east; this distribution can be obtained with the estimated results by using either of the two methods. In addition, the SSM estimations by using the two methods are in good correlation with the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product. The present study indicates that the second order polynomial method can simulate the change in SSM in the triangle space more realistically and effectively and that the second order polynomial method is more suitable for the estimation of SSM over the alpine vegetation region of the Tibetan Plateau.},

The green mulch had higher carbon and nutrient contents as compared to its compost and vermicompost forms, and so were the hemicellulose, cellulose and lignin. Significant reduction in C/N ratio from fresh water hyacinth indicated rapid N release while composting. Over all, mulching significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) increased soil C, total N, available P and K as compared to the non-mulched plots. Nonetheless, soil C was greater in the green mulch plots, followed by compost and vermicompost plots. Net N mineralization rate also followed similar patterns. Upon comparison with other aquatic weedy species, E. crassipes had 20-50\% more C and 10-40\% more N in its residues. Likewise, the compost prepared out of E. crassipes also seems to be of good quality as indicated by a C/N ratio less than 25, as compared to Hydrilla spp., Najas spp., Ottelia spp. and Pistia stratiotes. It is therefore suggested that recycling of water hyacinth can be an ecofriendly aquatic weed management strategy to improve soil health and nutrient redistribution through a faster turnover that can engineer sustainable agricultural production in the tropical soils.

The inclusion of legumes in RWCS assumes a great significance to restore soil fertility. But farmers in the IGPR rarely grow legumes in the system. We, therefore, carried out farmers' participatory diagnostic survey in the Upper Gangetic plain zone (UGP) to understand farmers' fertilizer management practices for wheat (Trititicum aestivum L. Emend Fiori \& Paol) following rice (Oryza sativa L.) or pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan(L)Millsp). The survey indicated that most of the farmers in UGP grew pigeonpea in place of rice under RWCS as only a break crop at a 2-3 year interval. The farmers applied, on average, 11 kg N ha(-1) and 24 kg P ha(-1) to wheat sown after rice, and 12 kg N ha(-1) and 19 kg P ha(-1) to wheat sown after pigeonpea. Wheat yields, however, were lower (3.3 t ha(-1)) when sown after pigeonpea than after rice (3.7 t ha(-1)). The survey was followed by a field experiment at Modipuram (29degrees 4' N), Meerut, India that continued during the three consecutive years (1998-1999 to 2000-2001) to examine the effect of inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice on soil fertility, N and P use efficiency and yields of wheat. In 1998-1999, wheat yields after pigeonpea were lower than after rice, but improved significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) by 11.4-15.1\% in pigeonpea plots compared with those in rice plots during 1999-2000 and 2000-2001, respectively. The use efficiency of applied N and P fertilizers in wheat, measured as agronomic efficiency and apparent recovery, was increased with combined use of fertilizer N and P at recommended rate, and also with inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice. The post-wheat harvest NO3-N in soil profile beyond 45 cm depth was significantly greater under rice-wheat system than under pigeonpea-wheat system, suggesting that inclusion of pigeonpea may help in minimizing NO3-N leaching to deeper profile layers beyond root zone. Similarly, in the treatments receiving both 120 kg N and 26 kg P ha(-1), NO3-N beyond 45 cm soil depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone. Inclusion of pigeonpea in place of rice enhanced carbon accumulation in the soil profile. The available P content was, however, invariably low under pigeonpea plots as compared to that under rice. With continuous rice-wheat cropping, the bulk density (BD) of soil was increased, especially in the 30-45 cm soil profile. Inclusion of pigeonpea in the system not only helped maintaining soil BD at initial level in the surface (0-15 cm) soil layers, but also in decreasing (p {\textless} 0.05) BD in sub-surface layers (15-30 cm and 3045 cm). Compared to rice, a statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05) positive effect of pigeonpea on root volume (58\%) and root weight (99.5\%) of succeeding wheat was also recorded. The net economic returns under pigeonpea-wheat system were greater compared with rice-wheat system. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

To evaluate the possible maximum response of SSLW to climate change, the combination of the conditional nonlinear optimal perturbation related to the parameter (CNOP-P) approach and projections from 10 general circulation models (GCMs) of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5 (CMIP5) are used. The CNOP-P-type temperature change scenario, a new type of temperature change scenario, is determined by using the CNOP-P method and constrained by the temperature change projections from the 10 GCMs under a high-emission scenario (the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario). Numerical results have shown that the response of SSLW to the CNOP-P-type temperature scenario is stronger than those to the 11 temperature scenarios derived from the 10 GCMs and from their ensemble average in the entire `3H' region. In the northern region, SSLW under the CNOP-P-type scenario increases to 0.1773 m(3) m(aEuro'3); however, SSLW in the scenarios from the GCMs fluctuates from 0.1671 to 0.1748 m(3) m(aEuro'3). In the southern region, SSLW decreases, and its variation (-0.0070 m(3) m(aEuro'3)) due to the CNOP-P-type scenario is higher than each of the variations (-0.0051 to -0.0026 m(3) m(aEuro'3)) due to the scenarios from the GCMs.},

Moench.) cropping system in rainfed Alfisols of southern Telangana region of Andhra Pradesh. Application of recommended dose of NPK for castor (60-40-30 kg/ha) recorded higher seed yield (1 614 kg/ha) which was comparable with NPK + 5 tonnes FYM/ha (1 589 kg/ha) and 75 \% NPK + 25 \% N through FYM (1 512 kg/ha). Whereas for sorghum, recommended NPK (60-30-30 kg/ha) + 5 tonnes FYM/ha recorded higher sorghum seed yield (3 147 kg/ha) which was comparable with the treatment, recommended dose of NPK (2 718 kg/ha) and 75\% NPK + 25\% N through FYM (2 696 kg/ha). Imbalanced application of N alone or NP or 50 \% NPK and control plots recorded significantly the lowest seed yields of both crops. Response to zinc application was observed only in third crop cycle of sorghum. The system productivity in terms of castor equivalent yield (CEY) was the highest in NPK + 5 tonnes FYM/ha treatment (2 847 kg/ha) which was 84.3 \% higher than the control (1 544 kg/ha). This treatment recorded the maximum gross returns ((sic). 71 175 /ha), net returns ((sic). 45 025 /ha) and benefit cost ratio (2.72). At the end of 3 cropping cycles (6 years), the treatment receiving NPK + 5 tonnes FYM/ha significantly improved the soil available N, P, K, organic carbon and micro nutrient (Fe, Mn and Zn) status compared to control or imbalanced fertilizer treatments.},

	abstract = {Global Level-3 surface soil moisture (SM) maps derived from the passive microwave SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) observations at L-band have recently been released. In this study, a comparative analysis of this Level 3 product (referred to as SMOSL3) along with another Surface SM (SSM) product derived from the observations of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) at C-band is presented (this latter product is referred to as AMSRM). SM-DAS-2, a SSM product produced by the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) was used to monitor both SMOSL3 and AMSRM qualities. The present study was carried out from 03/2010 to 09/2011, a period during which both SMOS and AMSR-E products were available at global scale. Three statistical metrics were used for the evaluation; the correlation coefficient (R), the Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD), and the bias. Results were analysed using maps of biomes and Leaf Area Index (LAI). It is shown that both SMOSL3 and AMSRM captured well the spatio-temporal variability of SM-DAS-2 for most of the biomes. In terms of correlation values, the SMOSL3 product was found to better capture the SSM temporal dynamics in highly vegetated biomes (”tropical humid”, “temperate humid”, etc.) while best results for AMSRM were obtained over arid and semi-arid biomes (”desert temperate”, “desert tropical”, etc.). Finally, we showed that the accuracy of the remotely sensed SSM products is strongly related to LAI. Both the SMOSL3 and AMSRM (marginally better) SSM products correlated well with the SM-DAS-2 product over regions with sparse vegetation for values of LAI {\textless}= 1 (these regions represent almost 50\% of the pixels considered in this global study). In regions where LAI{\textgreater}1, SMOSL3 showed better correlations with SM-DAS-2 than AMSRM: SMOSL3 had a consistent performance up to LAI = 6, whereas the AMSRM performance deteriorated with increasing values of LAI. This study reveals that SMOS and AMSR-E complement one another in monitoring SSM over a wide range in conditions of vegetation density and that there are valuable satellite observed SSM data records over more than 10 years, which can be used to study land atmosphere processes.

	doi = {10.1016/j.fcr.2009.12.002},
	abstract = {In the Indo-Gangetic Plain region, a major deterrent to large scale adoption of the otherwise advantageous pigeonpea-wheat cropping system is the poor crop stand of pigeonpea due to temporary water logging during the rainy (monsoon) season, leading to its low productivity and a smaller residual effect on the succeeding wheat crop. The permanent raised bed (PRB) system of planting, as widely used particularly for wheat in different countries, has seldom been studied in the pigeonpea-wheat system. We, therefore, conducted a field experiment at Modipuram (29 degrees 4'N, 77 degrees 46'E, 237 m asl), India, for 3 consecutive years (2001-02 to 2003-04) to evaluate the PRB vis-A-vis the conventional flat bed (FB) system of planting at varying fertilizer NP rates in the pigeonpea-wheat system, in terms of changes in soil organic carbon, nutrient and water use efficiencies, annual productivity and economic returns. Pigeonpea grown on PRB had lower plant mortality (4-7\%) and higher yield (1.6-2.1 t ha(-1))as compared to FB with 26-36\% mortality and yield of 1.3-1.8 it ha(-1). Pigeonpea on PRB had greater N and P recycling (11-23\% N and 8-14\% P) through its residue comprising root, stubble and leaf litter. Although wheat yield following pigeonpea under PRB was lower (p {\textless} 0.05) compared with that under FB, the system productivity in terms of wheat equivalent yield was 8.44\% higher under PRB. The economic optimum doses of fertilizer N and P for wheat in the pigeonpea-wheat system were smaller (128 kg N and 28 kg P ha-1) under PRB as compared to FB (152 kg N and 30 kg P ha-1) owing to increased N and P supply, greater P use efficiency and a better crop growth environment under PRB planting. The N use efficiency indices were significantly greater (p {\textless} 0.05) in wheat under FB compared to those under PRB. By contrast, P use efficiency was greater under PRB, particularly in treatments that received both N and P fertilizers. Compared with FB, the root mass density (20-46\%) of wheat was also greater under PRB in surface and sub-surface soil layers. PRB favored saving of irrigation water by 9.5-13.4 ha cm and improved the irrigation application efficiency by 9.5-13.4\% and the irrigation use efficiency by 1928 kg ha cm(-1) over FB. The post-wheat harvest nitrate N (NO3-N) at 20-40 cm soil depth in plots fertilized with 120 or 180 kg N ha(-1) was greater under FB planting (10.25-13.81 mg kg(-1)) compared to PRB (7.33-8.42 mg kg(-1)), suggesting that PRB planting might reduce NO3-N leaching to deeper soil layers. Similarly, in the treatments that received both N and P, NO3-N in soil below 20 cm depth was lower compared to those receiving N or P alone. After three crop cycles, soil OC and the Olsen-P content in the 0-20 cm depth were increased compared to the initial content under both planting techniques but the magnitude of increase was greater under PRB. Compared with FB, the annual net returns of the pigeonpea-wheat system were greater by US\$ 210 ha-1 under PRB, and the crop also required less specific energy (1.99 MJ kg(-1)) compared with the FB planting (3.18 MJ kg(-1)).

Combined application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants (S-5) registered highest CEY in both the seasons. Cotton intercropped with dhaincha (M-2) recorded highest uptake of N, P, and K. Among the nutrient management practices, application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants (S-5) showed highest uptake of N, P, and K. A similar trend was noticed in the post-harvest soil fertility too and it is significantly higher under cotton + dhaincha and application of 100\% recommended NPK with bioinoculants treatment compared to 100\% recommend NPK alone. It could be concluded from these results that crop productivity can be improved and soil fertility status can be sustained with integrated plant nutrient management practices.},

In this study, four previously developed mtlD transgenic (T) peanut lines were used for detailed characterization under DS, at the reproductive stage using lysimeter system under controlled greenhouse conditions. In dry-down experiments, T lines maintained better photosynthetic machinery, such as, photosynthesis rate, stomatal conductance, transpiration rate, and SPAD (Soil-Plant Analyses Development) values, and had lower oxidative damage, including lipid membrane peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical accumulation than WT, when exposed to 24 days of DS. WT plants had a more negative water potential (WP; up to -3.22 MPa) than T lines did (-2.56 to -2.71 MPa) at day 24 of DS treatment. During recovery, T lines recovered easily whereas 67\% of WT plants failed to recover. In T lines, the rate of photosynthesis strongly and positively correlated with the transpiration rate (r = 0.92), RWC (r = 0.90), WP (r = 0.86), and total chlorophyll content (r = 0.75), suggesting its strong correlation with water retention-related parameters. Furthermore, yield parameters such as, pod weight and harvest index of T lines were up to 2.19 and 1.38 times more than those of WT plants, respectively. Thus, the significantly better performance of mtlD T peanut lines than of WT plants under DS could be attributed to the accumulation of mannitol, which in turn helped in maintaining the osmoregulation and ROS scavenging activity of mannitol and ultimately conferred water-economizing capacity and higher yield in T lines than in WT plants.},

A set of two global 61-day analysis/forecast experiments based on the Integrated Forecast System at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) has been performed for June and July 2002. Analyses and forecasts based on the operational Optimal Interpolation (OI) scheme are compared against results obtained from an open loop system, in which soil moisture evolves freely. It is found that soil moisture assimilation or analysis has a significant impact on the model atmosphere. Temperature forecasts for the Northern Hemisphere up to a level of 700 hPa and up to nine days were significantly improved when the operational analysis was used. A comparison of volumetric soil moisture against in situ observations from the Oklahoma Mesonet reveals, however, that the operational OI system fails to improve both the analysis and the subsequent forecast of soil moisture itself. In addition, the system is not able to correct soil moisture for errors introduced through wrong precipitation in the background forecasts. Biweekly observations from the Illinois Climate Network support these findings. This study confirms the long assumed ( but rarely proven) characteristics of analysis schemes using screen-level variables: The observations are efficient in improving the turbulent surface fluxes and consequently the weather forecast on large geographical domains. The quality of the resulting soil moisture profile is often not sufficient for hydrological or agricultural applications.},

In this paper, both those in situ observations and a synthetic data set covering continental France are used to test a simple method to retrieve root zone soil moisture from a time series of surface soil moisture information. A recursive exponential filter equation using a time constant, T, is used to compute a soil water index. The Nash and Sutcliff coefficient is used as a criterion to optimise the T parameter for each ground station and for each model pixel of the synthetic data set. In general, the soil water indices derived from the surface soil moisture observations and simulations agree well with the reference root-zone soil moisture. Overall, the results show the potential of the exponential filter equation and of its recursive formulation to derive a soil water index from surface soil moisture estimates. This paper further investigates the correlation of the time scale parameter T with soil properties and climate conditions. While no significant relationship could be determined between T and the main soil properties ( clay and sand fractions, bulk density and organic matter content), the modelled spatial variability and the observed inter-annual variability of T suggest that a weak climate effect may exist.},

	abstract = {Better managing crop : weed competition in cropping systems while reducing both nitrogen and herbicide inputs is a real challenge that requires a better understanding of crop and weed root architecture in relation to soil-nitrogen availability. An original approach was used which considered the parameters of a simulation model of root architecture as traits to analyse (a) the interspecific diversity of root system architecture, and (b) its response to soil-nitrogen availability. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted using three crop and nine weed species grown at two contrasted concentrations of soil-nitrogen availability. Plant traits were measured to characterise both overall plant growth and root architecture, with a focus on primary root emergence, root elongation and branching. The studied root traits varied among species (from a twofold to a fourfold factor, depending on the trait), validating their use as indicators to analyse the interspecific variability of root architecture. The largest interspecies differences were for two traits: ` maximal apical root diameter' and ` interbranch distance' (distance between two successive laterals on the same root). Conversely, most of the studied root traits varied little with soil-nitrogen availability (from no variation to a 1.1-fold factor, depending on the trait) even though soil-nitrogen availability varied with a 17-fold factor and impacted the overall shoot and root biomass. So, the root traits used in this article are stable whatever soil-nitrogen availability. As they reflect processes underlying root system architecture, this low effect of nitrogen suggests that the rules governing root architecture are little affected by plant nitrogen status and soil-nitrogen availability. We propose that the determinants of differences in root system architecture between soils with contrasted nitrogen availability mainly originate from differences in the amount of carbon allocated to and within the root system. Characterising each plant species by a combination of root traits gave insights regarding the potential species competitive ability for soil resources in agroecosystems.},

Six treatments were evaluated: control (without K input), wheat straw at 0.9 t ha(-1), cotton residue at 0.7 t ha(-1), wheat straw and cotton residue at the aforementioned rates, and 150 and 300 kg ha(-1) fertiliser K. Treatments in each rotation year had an identical rate of nitrogen and phosphate fertiliser application. The initial soil K content was higher in Dafeng than Nanjing. In the low K content soil of Nanjing, crop K uptake with double crop straw was significantly higher than that under single crop straw return or inorganic fertiliser, and K uptake increased with increasing K inputs. Only double crop straw or 300 kg ha(-1) fertiliser K treatments reached apparent K balance in Nanjing, but not in Dafeng. The high negative K balance resulted from the elevated K removal by crops in Dafeng. Incorporation of double crop residues favoured accumulation of different forms of K. Application of K fertiliser tended to increase soil water-soluble K, and crop residue incorporation greatly improved non-exchangeable K at a depth of 0-20 cm. Similar to K fertiliser, crop residue incorporation significantly increased soil K release and decreased K fixation at both sites. In summary, in a 3-year field experiment, crop residue incorporation and inorganic K fertilisation had similar effects on soil K pools and balance depending on initial soil K level and actual K input.},

The mixtures increased the concentrations of K, Ca, Mg, N-NO3-, and S-SO42- in the subsurface layers. The sulphur concentration in the flag leaves of upland rice was higher with phosphogypsum application.

	abstract = {Maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for the long-term productivity of agroecosystems. An investigation was conducted to study the effects of long-term application of inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content, water-stable aggregate distribution, and aggregate-associated carbon in a field experiment started in 1982 in an and region of northwest China. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone (N, NP, or NPK treatments) did not increase SOC concentrations compared with no application of fertilizers (CK) and SOC concentration was significantly reduced, by 18\% on average, compared with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment. Application of imbalanced inorganic fertilizer (N and NP), especially, resulted in a significant decrease in available phosphorus and potassium nutrients at a depth of 20 cm. This indicates that long-term application of inorganic fertilizers were inadequate to maintain levels of SOC and nutrients under conventional management with no aboveground crop residues returning to the soil. Long-term application of FYM alone or combined with inorganic fertilizers (M (FYM), MN, MNPK, or MNPK treatments), however, improved SOC and total nitrogen concentrations from initial values of 12.1 and 0.76 g kg(-1), respectively, to 15.46 and 1.28 g kg(-1), on average, and also enhanced available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations by 47, 50, and 68\%, respectively, during the 23-year period. Treatment with FYM resulted in a 0.48 mm greater average mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and a higher percentage of macro-aggregates ({\textgreater} 2 mm) and small macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm) than treatment without FYM. The MWD increased with increasing SOC concentration (R-2=0.75). The SOC concentration was highest in small macro-aggregates, intermediate in macro-aggregates, and lowest in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm). Approximately 54-60\% of total SOC was stored in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm) and sand+silt fractions ({\textless} 0.05 mm) after treatment without FYM but 57-64\% of total SOC was stored in macro-aggregates ({\textgreater} 0.25 mm) after treatment with FYM.

Groundcovers can be used as green mulches, help reduce the use of farm chemicals, and provide several environmental benefits. We investigated the performance of a low-input cropping system by combining two legume cover crops [Dutch white clover (Trifolium repens) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa)] in combination with low rates of inorganic fertilizers as a step toward a more sustainable production system. The randomized block design comprised one cover crop and one of three applications of reduced rate inorganic fertilizer (75\%, 50\%, and 25\% of the recommended rate). A conventional system using herbicides for weed control and the 100\% rate of inorganic fertilizer was used as a control. Parameters measured included tree morphology, foliar nitrogen concentration, soil mineral nitrogen, and nitrate-N leaching below the root zone. A significant positive growth response (height and diameter) was obtained in all alfalfa-based cropping systems. This was accompanied by foliar nutrient concentrations similar to conventional plots and a reduction in nitrate-N leaching. However, in white clover-based cropping systems, the growth response was reduced (both height and diameter), suggesting competition for soil resources. In addition, the total nitrate-N leaching was higher in this system, suggesting an imbalance between mineral nitrogen availability and use in white clover-based cropping systems. We conclude that if the potential competition between cover crops and trees can be properly managed, legume cover crops can be effectively used to make intensive production tree-based systems more sustainable. Further studies related to mineralization and macronutrient flows are needed before any definite recommendation can be made about the use of these systems in large-scale production systems.},

This study focused on predicting soil moisture content, total dry matter, crop yield and water productivity of potato crop using traditional and modified, self-compensating gate outlet (SCGO) gated pipe using the SALTMED model to explore the model suitability to identify the optimum and economic gate spacings. The traditional gated pipes are known to exhibit a range of pressure head variations along the pipeline causing a non-uniform discharge from orifices while the modified gate pipe system, known as compensating gated pipes (SCGO) stabilizes the pressure heads and produce more uniform water discharge along the pipe line. The effect of three gate spacings (0.7, 1.0 and 1.5 m) was studied in a field experiment that has been conducted for two successive seasons, 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. The SALTMED model has been applied and showed excellent agreement between the simulated and observed soil moisture, dry matter, yield and water productivity. Similar to the field results, the simulated values indicated that the modified (SCGO), with the 1.5 m gate spacing, gave the highest yield and water productivity. The modified gated pipe received less water than the traditional gated pipe, due to its high application efficiency. In addition to water saving, there is an economic benefit for using 1.5 m gate spacings as its cost is low (14 gates per 21 m pipe length) in comparison with 1.0 m and 0.7 m spacings. The results confirmed SALTMED ability to simulate with high precision, soil moisture, dry matter, water productivity and yield for potato under gated pipe irrigation. Therefore, the model can be used for design purposes to identify the optimum and economic gate spacings without the need to conduct expensive, costly and labor intensive field trials.

Irrespective of whether relative sap flow was assessed using sap flow sensors in vivo or by pressurization of de-topped roots, each root system contributed similarly to total sap flow during DI, while sap flow from roots in drying soil declined linearly with soil water potential (Psi(soil)) during PRD. Although Psi(soil) of the irrigated pot determined the threshold Psi(soil) at which sap flow from roots in drying soil decreased, the slope of this decrease was independent of the wet pot Psi(soil). Irrespective of whether sap was collected from the wet or dry root system of PRD plants, or a DI plant, root xylem ABA concentration increased as Psi(soil) declined. The model, which weighted ABA contributions of each root system according to the sap flow from each, almost perfectly explained [X-ABA] immediately above the graft union. That the model overestimated measured [X-ABA](leaf) may result from changes in [X-ABA] along the transport pathway or an artefact of collecting xylem sap from detached leaves. The implications of declining sap flow through partially dry roots during PRD for the control of stomatal behaviour and irrigation scheduling are discussed.},

However, information is limited on the soil P transformation induced by application of fertilizer P in eastern China where most soils are inherently low in plant available P. The objective of this study was to investigate the long-term effect of various combinations of composted pig manure, rice straw, and inorganic fertilizers on the soil P pools, the subsequent P uptake by crops, and potential environmental effects. A long-term fertilizer field trial was established on a silty clay loam in east China since 1996. The trial had six treatments: no fertilizer application, combination of inorganic fertilizers and rice straw, combination of inorganic fertilizers and organic manure, inorganic fertilizers only, rice straw only, and organic manure only. Soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected from each plot at the trial site in May 2013. Soil was analyzed for pH, organic matter, Olsen P, and Mehlich 3 P (M3 P). Hedley's fractionation method was applied for P fractionation, and a soil P mass balance was evaluated. The accumulation of total soil P (TP), Olsen P, and M3 P was most pronounced (p {\textless} 0.05) when inorganic fertilizer P was applied in combination with manure, while the use of straw instead of manure did not lead to such an increase. Recovery by plant biomass as a percentage of applied P was greater in plots with inorganic P fertilizer than plots treated with manure alone. Based on the results of P fractionation, residual fertilizer P accumulated mostly as moderately labile and sparingly labile forms of P, irrespective of the type of fertilizer P applied. Application of organic manure apparently prevented the conversion of applied fertilizer P into recalcitrant P forms and resulted in relatively larger proportions of available P. From both agronomic and environmental perspectives, combined application of inorganic fertilizer P and organic manure is a promising agronomic strategy for increasing soil P availability and reducing P loss from the rice-wheat rotation system.},

	abstract = {The land surface soil moisture is a crucial variable in weather and climate models. This study presents a land data assimilation system (LDAS) that aims to improve the simulation of the land surface soil moisture and energy fluxes by merging the microwave remote sensing data and the general circulation model (GCM) output into a land surface model (LSM). This system was applied over the Tibetan Plateau, using the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis data as forcing data and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometers for EOS (AMSR-E) brightness temperatures as an observation. The performance of our four data sources, which were NCEP, AMSR-E, LDAS and simulations of Simple Biosphere Model 2 (SiB2), was assessed against 5 months of in situ measurements that were performed at two stations: Gaize and Naqu. For the surface soil moisture, the LDAS simulations were superior to both NCEP and SiB2, and there was more than a one-third reduction in the root mean squared errors (RMSE) for both of the stations. Compared with the AMSR-E soil moisture retrievals, the LDAS simulations were comparable at the Gaize station, and they were superior at the Naqu station. For the whole domain inter-comparison, the results showed that the LDAS simulation of the soil moisture field was more realistic than the NCEP and SiB2 simulations and that the LDAS could estimate land surface states properly even in the regions where AMSR-E failed to cover and/or during the periods that the satellite did not overpass. For the surface energy fluxes, the LDAS estimated the latent heat flux with an acceptable accuracy (RMSE less than 35 W/m(2)), with a one-third reduction in the RMSE from the SiB2. For the 5-month whole plateau simulation, the LDAS produced a much more reasonable Bowen Ratio than the NCEP, and it also generated a clear contrast of the land surface status over the plateau, which was wet in the southeast and dry in the northwest, during the monsoon and post-monsoon seasons. Because the LDAS only uses globally available data sets, this study reveals the potential of the LDAS to improving the land surface energy and water flux simulations in ungauged and/or poorly gauged regions.

	abstract = {On-line measurement of soil properties using the visible (Vis) and near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy is sensitive to soil-to-sensor distance (D) and angle (alpha) variations, which have prevented the successful development of on-line soil sensors so far. This study was undertaken to minimise these variations through optimising the three-point linkage of the tractor to improve the quality of soil spectra and the accuracy of plant available phosphorus (P-avl) measured with an on-line soil sensor. The sensor consisted of a tine, to the back of which an optical probe was attached to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance mode from the bottom of the trench opened by the tine. A mobile, fibre-type, Vis-NIR spectrophotometer (Zeiss Corona 45 visnir fibre, Germany), with a measurement range of 306.5-1710.9 nm was used. Five lengths of the third point link (L) of the tractor of 545, 550, 555, 560 and 565 mm were selected to evaluate the quality of spectra collected on-line at 0.15 m tine depth. The on-line measured spectra were corrected to remove the effect of D and a. The correction was evaluated by estimating the accuracy of predicting P-avl using on-line measured spectra and a previously developed P-avl calibration model. Results showed that the best quality of spectra measured on-line was obtained for L of 555 mm, at which D and alpha vanished. This finding was supported by the maximum value of average maximum reflectance (AMR) of 75.7\% obtained and by 100\% successfully collected spectra. The worst quality of spectra was obtained at L of 545 mm, with the largest D of 6 mm and the largest alpha of 0.6 degrees. Values of L of 560 and 565 mm led to a decrease in the AMR (43.3 and 33.2\%, respectively), while recording 100\% successful spectra. Correction of on-line measured spectra led to clear improvements in the accuracy of on-line measured P-avl. A lower root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.07 mg 100 g(-1) and higher ratio of prediction deviations (RPD) of 1.42 were obtained with corrected spectra as compared to uncorrected spectra (RMSE = 1.15 and RPD = 1.39). In addition, the correction of spectra resulted in an increase in the degree of similarity between laboratory and on-line measured P-avl maps by 29.6\%. These results suggest the need for optimising the tractor hydraulic three-point linkage set up, and for spectra correction in order to improve the accuracy of on-line measured soil properties.

Evaluated cover crops should be able to suppress weed growth, reduce plant available nitrogen in the soil and produce large amounts of biomass with slow N mineralisation. Six non-legume species; spring rye (Secale cereale L.), black oat (Avena sativa L.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), white mustard (Sinapis alba L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench) and hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) were tested. Plots with organic fertiliser (50 kg N ha(-1)) and without fertiliser incorporation at three locations in south-east Germany were trialled and the cover crops' ability to produce biomass and accumulate N in plant compartments was evaluated. The N mineralisation from stem and leaf material was simulated using the STICS model. The biomass production ranged from 0.95 to 7.73 Mg ha(-1), with fertiliser increasing the total biomass at locations with low-N status. Sunflower consistently displayed large biomass and N accumulation at all locations and fertiliser variations, although not always significantly more than other species. Most N was stored in sunflower leaf material, which can be easily mineralised making it less suited as cover crop before no-till sown spring grain legumes. Rye, which produced slightly less biomass, but accumulated more N in the stem biomass, would be better suited than sunflower in this type of system. The N mineralisation simulation from rye biomass indicated long N immobilisation periods potentially improving weed suppression within no-till sown legume cash crops.},

A three-year replicated study was conducted to assess the effects of agronomic modification of traditional farming practices on productivity and sustainability of rice (wet season)-rice (dry season) system (RRS). The replacement of farmers practice (T-2) with conservation effective tillage (no-till (NT)) and integrated nutrient management (INM) practice along with 30\% residue retention (T-5) enhanced the straw, root and biomass yield of both wet season rice (WR), dry season rice (DR) and system as a whole over T-2. Treatment T-5 recorded significantly lower soil bulk density ((b)) and higher pH than the T-2 after three years of the experiment. Further, treatment T-5 increased total soil organic carbon (2.8\%), total soil organic carbon stock (2.8\%), carbon sequestration rate (336.5 kg ha(-1) year(-1)), cumulative carbon stock (142.9\%) and carbon retention efficiency (141.0\%) over T-2 of 0-20 cm depth after three year. The soil microbial biomass carbon concentration was significantly the highest under T-5. Similarly, the dehydrogenase activity was the maximum under T-5. Adoption of conservation tillage and nutrient management practice involving NT and INM along with residue retention can enhance the system productivity, and C and N sequestration in paddy soils is thereby contributing to the sustainability of the RRS.},

	abstract = {Rice-wheat cropping systems managed on 10 million ha in the Indo-Gangetic Plain region (IGPR) of India are the most important production systems for national food security. Recent reports, however, indicate that the system is under production fatigue and the growth rates of rice and wheat have started declining. We, therefore, conducted field experiments at Modipuram, Meerut, India, for 3 consecutive years (1998-99 to 2000-01), to study the conservation of soil organic carbon, improvement in nitrogen use efficiency and increase in system yields through inclusion of a grain legume ( pigeon pea) in place of rice. The wheat yields following pigeon pea crops were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) greater than those following rice crops during 1999-2000 and 2000-01, but not during 1998-99. The economic optimum doses of fertiliser N for wheat in the pigeon pea-wheat system were smaller (128-133 kg N/ha) than those in the rice-wheat system (139-173 kg N/ha), owing to increased N supply, greater N use efficiencies and a better crop growth environment in the pigeon pea-wheat system. The post-wheat harvest nitrate-N (NO3-N) at 90-105 cm soil depth in plots fertilised with 120 or 180 kg N/ha was greater for the rice-wheat system (6.5-8.1 mg/kg) than for the pigeon pea-wheat system (5.8-6.0 mg/kg), suggesting that inclusion of pigeon pea may help to minimise NO3-N leaching to deeper soil profile layers. In plots of pigeon pea, soil organic carbon at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm soil depths was increased at the end of the experiment compared with the initial organic carbon content. With continuous rice-wheat cropping, the bulk density of soil increased over the initial bulk density, at different soil profile depths in general, and at 30-45 cm soil depth in particular. Inclusion of pigeon pea in the system maintained soil bulk density at its initial level, and thus eliminated sub-surface soil compaction. Despite these advantages of pigeon pea over rice as a preceding crop to wheat, permanent substitution of rice with pigeon pea in rice-wheat system is unlikely, because rice is a staple foodgrain crop in India. Nonetheless, decline in wheat productivity owing to puddling-induced soil constraints that arise on continuous rice-wheat systems could be minimised by introduction of pigeon pea into the system at longer time intervals.},

	abstract = {Productivity of the rice-wheat system is critical to the food security of Bangladesh. However, many concerns about the sustainability of this system exist because of low soil organic matter (SOM). In this context, an experiment was performed in the agro-ecological zone of the High Ganges River Floodplain (HGRF) at the Regional Wheat Research Centre (RWRC), Rajshahi of the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute (BARI) over two consecutive years, 2009-2010 and 2010-2011. The experiment evaluated the productivity and changes in soil fertility of the wheat-rice cropping sequence as influenced by an integrated plant nutrition system (IPNS) and through the inclusion of legume crops. Two factors were considered: cropping sequence and IPNS treatment. A legume crop was fitted to the existing wheat-rice sequence, resulting in four cropping sequences: wheat-mungbean-rice, wheat-blackgram-rice, wheat-dhaincha-rice and wheat-fallow-rice. There were six fertilizer/manure treatments: 100\% recommended artificial fertilizer, farmers' practice (FP) and four IPNS treatments. The IPNS treatments comprised two rates of poultry manure (PM; 3 and 6 t ha(-1)) and cowdung (CD; 5 and 10 t ha(-1)). For the IPNS treatments, 100\% nutrient rates were adjusted with manure (PM and CD) and artificial fertilizers. The inclusion of legumes in the wheat-rice cropping sequence, particularly the use of mungbean, resulted in the highest productivity. This system rendered 57\% higher wheat equivalent yield (WEY) than the wheat-fallow-rice cropping sequence. The incorporation of legume residues into the soil increased SOM, total N, available P and available Zn, but exchangeable K and available S were depleted under all crop rotations. The simultaneous use of chemical fertilizer and organic manure (OM; PM and CD) with the IPNS approach resulted in higher crop productivity and system WEY as well as higher rates of OM, especially IPNS with 6 t ha(-1) PM. This indicates that chemical fertilizers alone could not provide adequate and balanced nutrition for potential yield of the tested crops. SOM, total N, available P and available Zn improved in treatments that included OM (both PM and CD) but the increment was greater in the combination of IPNS with higher rates of both OMs in the wheat-dhaincha-rice cropping sequence. K and S decreased in all nutrient treatments compared to initial soil. The wheat-mungbean-rice cropping sequence under IPNS with OM (especially 3-6 t ha(-1) PM) resulted in best crop productivity (wheat, 4.55; rice, 5.48; WEY of mungbean, 4.54 and system WEY, 13.19 t ha(-1)) in both years.

Mean values for tillage revealed that conservation tillage (ZT and RI) resulted in higher spikes per m(2), biological yield, grain yield, soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen compared with CT. Mean values for seed rates displayed the highest yield and yield components at 130 kg ha(-1) and showed the lowest values at 70 kg ha(-1) seed rate.

In contrast, CT in combination with 130 kg ha(-1) seed rate gave the highest grain yield in the second growing season. The results emphasized the necessity of using 130 kg ha(-1) seed rate in ZT for improving soil organic matter and total soil nitrogen, and sustaining wheat yield in poorly drained silty clay soil. However, in case of severe infestation with weeds or insect pests, CT in combination with 130 kg ha(-1) seed rate may be the best alternative.},

It is quite often sparsely intercropped in cereal-based cropping systems in the subhumid zone of Ghana. Management of pigeon pea and its biomass is a promising means of improving many abandoned arable fields but has not been consciously undertaken. The objective of this trial was to explore the use of pigeon pea and the management of its pruned biomass as part of an improved fallow for crop-livestock farming. Three pigeon-pea management options and a natural fallow (two-year fallow period) were compared in terms of maize grain yield and changes in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity. Pigeon pea grain yield ranged between 615 and 678 kg ha(-1) and 527 and 573 kg ha(-1) in the first and second year of fallow, respectively. In the first year after fallow, maize gain yield ranged between 0.43 and 2.39 t ha(-1) and was significantly influenced by the fallow system. There was a marked decrease in maize grain on the pigeon pea fallow plots in the second year, ranging between 50 and 38.6 per cent in Kumayili and between 42.6 and 17.6 per cent in Tingoli. After the two-year fallow period, increase of soil organic carbon on the pigeon pea fallow plot compared with the natural fallow plot was 30.5 per cent, and there was an improvement of total nitrogen (48.5 per cent) and CEC (17.8 per cent).

Experimentation was carried out at Palampur, India, in a randomized bock design (RBD), replicated three times with fourteen treatments comprising AM fungi (Glomus mosseae), inorganic phosphorus (50, 75, and 100\% soil-test-based recommended P dose), irrigation regimes (at 40 and 80\% available water capacity), generalized recommended NPK and irrigations (GRD), and farmers' practice. Effects of AM fungi on plant height, leaf area index (LAI), and dry-matter accumulation (DMA) were nominal at early crop growth stage, i.e., 50 DAS (days after sowing). However, at 100 DAS, AMF imbedded treatments led to higher plant height (4\%), LAI (3\%), and DMA (6\%) in okra, whereas in pea the magnitude of increase in these parameters following AMF inoculation was 6, 5, and 8\%, respectively, over non-AMF counterparts. AMF + 75\% soil-test-based P dose at either of these irrigation regimes gave statistically similar yields in both okra and pea as that obtained under 100\% soil-test-based P dose at either of two irrigation regimes, thus indicating an economy of about 25\% in soil-test-based P dose. Regarding nutrient harvest index in okra and pea, statistically similar values were registered with most nutrients under both AMF inoculated and non-AMF counterparts. In the case of okra, P harvest index was registered less by 3\% with AMF inoculation; however, its magnitude increased by 3\% in pea following AMF inoculation compared to non-AMF counterparts at similar levels of P and irrigation. At completion of two cycles of okra-pea system, AMF imbedded treatments did not alter available soil nutrient status significantly in comparison to non-AMF counterparts. Overall, current study suggests that practice of AMF inoculation has great potential in enhancing growth parameters for better productivity, fertilizer-P economy, and nutrient harvest efficiency in okra-pea production system in Himalayan acidic Alfisol.},

This study was conducted to investigate the spatial distribution of soil moisture and roots in the soil profiles of an apple orchard employing a Rainwater Collection and Infiltration (RWCI) system on the Loess Plateau of China. The results showed that: 1) There was a low soil moisture content (SMC) zone between depths of 40 and 80 cm and the RWCI treatment significantly increased SMC in these depths; 2) The RCWI system increased SMC in the 20-140 cm depth interval and depths greater than 140 cm when the RCWI pit depths were 60 cm (RWCI60) and 80 cm (RWCI80), respectively; 3) The total dry root density under the control (CK), RWCI60 and RWCIN treatments was 372.12, 594.76 and 491.82 g/m3, respectively. The mass percentage root distributions in the 0-100, 100-200 and 200-300 cm depths were: CK (69.88\%, 13.74\% and 16.38\%); RWCI60 (70.35\%, 24.08\% and 5.58\%); and RWCI80 (46.54\%,15.04\% and 38.42\%), respectively. We found that root mass was concentrated close to the wetted soil depths affected by the RWCI treatment. The RWCI system apparently reduced drought stress through increased water and nutrients uptake because of increased subsoil SMC in the RWCI treatments. This study of the RWCI systems and the effects of the RCWI pit depth are important with respect to increasing the efficient use of rainwater, reducing drought stress and demonstrating the effectiveness of RWCI water saving technology in the rain-fed orchards in the Loess Plateau, China.

This change in irrigation method has a significant effect on moisture distribution within the soil profile, with implications for root growth, root-system architecture, and soil-water acquisition. Those issues are addressed in this paper. Our report is based on grapevines that had been established under a diffuse irrigation system (overhead sprinklers or microjets) and subsequently converted to drippers. Results are also presented to show the influence of soils with different water holding capacities on root distribution within a single vineyard. Variations in soil texture within a vineyard were found to influence the vertical distribution of roots, whereas irrigation history had more influence on horizontal variations in root density within a depth range. Conversion of vines from sprinkler irrigation to drippers resulted in a marked increase in total root mass (volume) under the drip line, particularly 25-50 cm below the surface. Roots were differentially influenced by irrigation history according to their diameter class. Under drip irrigation, the largest increase in root-length density occurred with roots in diameter classes between 1 and 4 mm diameter. Grapevines established under sprinklers, and subsequently converted to drip irrigation, had significantly larger root systems (within the volume of soil sampled) than did vines maintained under sprinklers throughout. Therefore, vines established under sprinkler irrigation and then converted to drippers may be better equipped to cope with deficit irrigation during drought (via either RDI or PRD), by virtue of those additional roots.},

	abstract = {Environmental factors greatly influence grape quality. Among them, the effect of within-vineyard variability of soil in relation to soil moisture on table grape under protected condition has rarely been studied. In this present research, we investigated the influence of soil variability, in relation with soil moisture on chlorophyll fluorescence, yield and quality attributes of the “Summer Black” (Vitis vinifera L. x V. labruscana L.) table grape, popularly grown under double cropping system in protected covering in the southern part of China. The vineyard was divided vertically into three sites ( lower, middle and upper, 192, 202 and 212 m above sea level, respectively) and data on soil moisture and other yield and quality parameters were recorded. Among the three vineyard sites, middle site resulted in higher yield compared to the upper and lower sites during winter and summer cropping cycles. However, compared to regular summer cycle, winter cycle provided grapevines with higher quality attributes. Polyphasic OJIP fluorescence transient exhibited a considerable increase in fluorescence intensity at J, I and P phase in the upper and middle sites compared to the lower site due to variation in soil moisture in both seasons. Values of fluorescence parameters including minimal fluorescence, relative variable fluorescence at phase J and I, the maximal quantum yield of photosystem II were also influenced by soil moisture in different sites. Different sites also exhibited a significant difference in total phenolics, flavonoid, antioxidant activity and individual anthocyanin which was influenced by available soil moisture. The present study shows that chlorophyll fluorescence OJIP transient can be used as a sensitive indicator to determine the moisture stress in grape grown in a varied soil. Double cropping proved to be a powerful technique to improve the fruit quality. This result may be useful for the table grape growers to better utilize the vineyard soil variability with water management to get higher yield and quality table grape under protected condition.},

	abstract = {A deep root system may be a desirable plant characteristic in upland rice because it improves the plant's water extraction capacity. The objective of the present study was to assess the deep root development of rice cultivars in relation to soil moisture change and plant water Status under upland conditions with moderate water deficits in the field and in simple lysimeter experiments. We used one upland cultivar (Yumeno-hatamochi' [YHM]) and two lowland cultivars (Lemont' [LMT] and Nipponbare' [NPB]) in the field experiment, with no supplemental water front 88 to 106 days after sowing (DAS) and 116 to 145 DAS. In the lysimeter experiment, we used YHM and NPB and imposed two water stress periods during the late vegetative stages (71 to 104 DAS and 88 to 104 DAS). In the lysimeter experiment, a higher deep-root length ratio (proportion of the length of deep roots to the total root length) in YHM was associated with a greater deep-root length than in NPB. The difference in deep root development was associated with change in soil water content at the depths of 45 to 70 cut between the two cultivars under the above conditions. The drought in the field experiment was less intense than in the lysimeter experiment, and we observed greater varietal differences in total aboveground biomass than in root system development; this was associated with the change in soil water content during the initial drought period. LMT, with smaller shoots, tended to save water and maintain higher leaf water potential and lower diffusion resistance as the drought progressed. Our results suggest that deep root development of rice was primarily advantageous for soil water extraction and plant water Status under moderate water stress in uplands, but that the advantage of a deep root system was affected by total aboveground biomass, which had strong effects on plant water status under these conditions.},

In okra, AMF inoculation significantly improved the fruit length, fruit girth and fruit weight besides enhancing rooting depth (13\%), root volume (7\%), root dry weight (7\%) and root weight density (6\%) over non-AMF treatments. In pea, AMF sharply increased the average pod weight (10\%), rooting depth (9\%), root volume (16\%), root dry weight (13\%) and root weight density (12\%) over non-AMF counterparts. AMF enhanced mycorrhizal root colonization by 2 to 2.3-fold both in okra and pea besides significant improvement in available soil-P pool (21\%). `AMF + 75\% soil-test based P dose (STB-P)' at both irrigation regimes remained statistically alike with generalized recommended nutrient-cum-irrigation dose (GRD) and `AMF + 100\% STB-P' with respect to fruit and root parameters in okra-pea system, thus, indicating an economy of about 25\% applied-P through AMF inoculation in acid Alfisol.

	abstract = {A sophisticated soil microcosm system and N-15-labeled urea were used to investigate nitrogen (N) use efficiency and soil N dynamics in a rice monoculture system in two successive seasons. Topsoil (0 cm-20 cm) and subsoil (20 cm-50 cm) samples were collected from a traditional double rice cropping field in the Jiangxi Province, China, and these soil samples were derived from Quaternary red clay. Treatments were randomly assigned with two irrigation regimes and three N application rates (no application control, 80\% traditional rate and 100\% traditional rate noted as N0, N1 and N2, respectively). The levels of N-15 recovery of plants, N-15 and N remaining in soil were determined. Moreover, the N dynamic of soil solution from different layers of the soil profile was surveyed. The results showed that the effects of irrigation management and N application rate varied in different rice growing seasons. Irrigation regimes had remarkable effects on grain yield and chemical N-15 fertilizers (CF-N-15) uptake. When compared to flood irrigation (FI), the shallow water depth with wetting and drying (WD) increased grain yield up to 5.7\%-20\%. Although the highest grain yield was obtained with reduced N application level, both N apparent recovery (NAR) and N-15 use efficiency (the percentage of plant N uptake derived from applied N, \%Ndfan) significantly decreased with increasing N inputs. However, the interaction between irrigation management and N application rate on grain yield and N use efficiency (NUE) of CF-N-15 were not significant. A survey of soil solutions every 5 days indicated that NH (4) (+) -N was the main residual form of N, and high NH (4) (+) -N leaching was observed. When compared to FI, WD decreased vertical NH (4) (+) -N and TN leaching, especially at 10-50 cm depths of soil profile in the second season. NH (4) (+) -N was the main N residual form in the soil profile. Therefore, in this study, the WD irrigation regime and reduced rate (N1) was the optimal irrigation and fertilizer management strategy to increase the NUE of CF-N, increase the after effects of CF-N-15, decrease leaching loss of CF-N-15 and minimize the shallow groundwater pollution risk, which were all beneficial for the ecological environment.},

Among all management practices, trees allowed to grow naturally (T-1 T-3 and T-5) significantly had higher tree growth (height, dbh and crown diameter) as compared to pruning of tree up to 70\% plant height (T-2, T-3, and T-6). The grain yield of intercrops, viz blackgram [Vigna mungo (L.) Hepper and Indian mustard [Brassica juncea (L.)

The yield of intercrops with root barrier (T-3 and T-4) was higher (0.44-0.60 tonnes/ha blackgram and 1.02-1.19 tonnes/ha mustard) than without barrier (T-1 and T-2). In case of Indian mustard, irrigation given to the crop as per requirement (T-5 and T-6) significantly gave higher yield (25\%) than the crop received one-irrigation (T-1 to T-4). The grain yield of pure crop (without tree) was higher compared to agrisilviculture.

Although three effective countermeasures for wind erosion (i.e. ridging, mulching with post-harvest crop residue, and windbreaks) have been proposed, they are not practical for Sahelian farmers. Therefore, we designed a new land management practice, termed the “Fallow Band System,” which can be used for both controlling wind erosion and improving soil fertility and crop production. This method does not impose additional expense and labor requirements on Sahelian farmers who are economically challenged and have limited manpower. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of this system on wind-erosion control and soil-fertility improvement. We conducted field experiments at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics West and Central Africa and showed that (i) a fallow band can capture 74\% of wind-blown soil particles and 58\% of wind-blown coarse organic matter, which suggests that it can effectively control wind erosion, (ii) the amount of soil nutrients available for crops in a former fallow band was increased by the decomposition of trapped soil materials containing considerable amounts of nutrients, and (iii) the amount of soil water available for crops in a former fallow band was increased by the trapped wind-blown soil materials through improvement of rainwater infiltration into surface soil. These results lead to the conclusion that the “Fallow Band System” can be useful for preventing desertification and improving soil fertility in the Sahel, West Africa.},

The experiment on sandy loam soil was laid out in split-split plot design assigning three dates of transplanting (27 June, 7 July and 17 July) in main plot, two rice hybrids (PHB-71 and Pusa RH-10) in sub-plot and three age of seedlings (10, 14 and 18-day old) in sub-sub plot with three replications. Results revealed that higher growth parameters, viz. plant height (104.2 cm), tillers/hill (20.4), leaf area index (5.16) and dry matter accumulation/hill (31.2 g) and yield attributes, viz. effective tillers/m(2) (248.2), panicle length (30.5 cm), grains/panicle (176), weight/panicle (5.08 g) and test weight (23.11 g), grain and straw yield (6.67 and 8.71 tonnes/ha, respectively) and harvest index (43.17) were observed under 27 June transplanting as compared to rest of the two dates of planting. Protein content in grain and kernel length before and after cooking also registered significant improvement in 27 June transplanted crop. The magnitude of increase in grain and straw yield of hybrid under SRI by the early transplanting (27 June) as compared to the late transplanting (17 July) was 19.9 and 15.2 \%, respectively on pooled basis. However, soil pH, EC, organic carbon, available NPK, hulling, milling and head rice recovery percentage, kernel breadth (B) before and after cooking, length (L) elongation ratio and L/B ratio remained unaffected due to different dates of transplanting. Among the hybrids, PHB-71 produced markedly higher plant height (104.8 cm), tillers/hill (17.6), leaf-area index (4.91), dry matter accumulation/hill (29.5 g), effective tillers/m(2) (236.4), panicle length (30.1 cm), grains/panicle (188), weight/panicle (4.62 g), test weight (22.67 g), grain yield (7.00 tonnes/ha), straw yield (8.95 tonnes/ha) and harvest index (43.87) over Pusa RH-10. Organic carbon content in soil as well as quality parameters viz. hulling, milling and head rice recovery percentage, protein content and kernel breadth before and after cooking were also recorded higher with PHB-71 than the Pusa RH-10. However, maximum available NPK, kernel length before and after cooking, length elongation and length breadth ratio before cooking were recorded with `Pusa RH-10'. Younger aged seedlings (10-day old) recorded significantly higher growth and yield parameters, yields and harvest index over older aged seedlings (18-day), whereas maximum available NPK was recorded with older aged seedlings (18-day). The 10-day old seedlings gave 6.4 and 12.9\% more grain yield than 14 and 18-day old seedlings, respectively. Interactive effect on grain yield was significant among date of transplanting, age of seedlings and hybrids. Transplanting of PHB-71 hybrid on 27 June having either 10 or 14-day old seedlings resulted in markedly higher grain yield as compared to rest of the treatments},

The first satellite data set is derived from 4 years of X-band (10.7 GHz) passive microwave brightness temperature observations by the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), and the second is from 9 years of C-band (6.6 GHz) brightness temperature observations by the Scanning Multichannel Microwave Radiometer (SMMR). Despite the similarity in the satellite instruments, the retrieved soil moisture data exhibit very large differences in their multiyear means and temporal variability, primarily because they are computed with different retrieval algorithms. The satellite retrievals are also compared to a soil moisture product generated by the NASA Catchment land surface model when driven with surface meteorological data derived from observations. The climatologies of both satellite data sets are different from those of the model products. Prior to assimilation of the satellite retrievals into the land model, satellite-model biases are removed by scaling the satellite retrievals into the land model's climatology through matching of the respective cumulative distribution functions. Validation against in situ data shows that for both data sets the soil moisture fields from the assimilation are superior to either satellite data or model data alone. A global analysis of the innovations ( defined as the difference between the observations and the corresponding model values prior to the assimilation update) reveals how changes in model and observations error parameters may enhance filter performance in future experiments.},

Consequently, this can lead to inappropriate or unnecessary irrigation. The main objective of this paper is the presentation of results of several experiments focused on determining adequate temperature compensation for a simple soil moisture measurement and registration system based on resistivity measurements (Wenner compensation). Moreover, a comparison between the data obtained by this device and a reference sensor is included. The device was calibrated in a plot with potted vineyards (Vitis vinifera L. cv Bobal on 110R) under drip irrigation and additional conditions. Results are adequate and include a method of compensation of measured values based in a rolling average model of soil temperature with a good agreement. A simple weighed combination of box temperature of the device and 14cm deeper temperatures can provide a useful level of Wenner compensation.

Since the soil moisture depends on the soil salinity (SS) in semi-arid regions, the S\_SMC method employs the SS as an effective and augmented variable in conventional UTM to estimate SMC in these areas. In calibration step, initially, a linear regression model between the land surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and the SS is applied using in situ measurements to assess the influence of the SS in SMC estimation. Then, a non-linearity model is conducted through insertion of more terms in the linear equation and an optimal model of S\_SMC is yielded. Moreover, the SS is obtained using a linear model from two selected salinity indices derived from Landsat images and in situ measurements. In estimation step, the LST, NDVI, and the SS are obtained using Landsat data. The S\_SMC method is evaluated in the Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx)-2 and SMAPEx-3 campaigns in wet and dry conditions, respectively, over two scenes of Landsat images. The results demonstrated that the S\_SMC method is appropriate in non-irrigated areas. In these areas, the S\_SMC method improves R-2 (coefficient of determination) from 22\% to 65\% in SMAPEx-2 and from 24\% to 50\% in SMAPEx-3. Moreover, the results have shown that the SMC can be estimated at satellite level with a root mean square error of 0.06 and 0.02 (m(3) m(-3)) in wet and dry condition, respectively. Therefore, the SS is a key parameter to adjust conventional UTM to improve the SMC estimation by the S\_SMC method.},

The clod size of surface soil, which showed a significant positive correlation with soil moisture at seeding, had a significant negative direct effect on the seedling establishment ratio. The reduction in seedling establishment ratio, together with fewer tillers per plant, resulted in a significant decrease in tiller density. The stun total of contribution of soil moisture contents to tiller density via clod size was smaller than that of seeding rate, and similar to that of the amount of nitrogen (N) basal dressing. This indicates that manipulating clod size based on soil moisture at seeding provides an opportunity for maintaining tiller density, as well as changing the amount of N basal dressing with the soil moisture conditions after rice cropping.},

Liming and fertilisation with sewage sludge could enhance the productivity of silvopastoral systems (including understory and trees) by increasing Ca and reducing Al in the soil. This study evaluated changes in soil chemical properties, tree growth and understory production in test plots, both limed and unlimed, in a silvopastoral system located on an acidic forest soil under Pinus radiata D. Don. This research compared the effects of different doses of sewage sludge (160, 320 and 480 kg total N ha(-1)) with the effects of mineral fertilisation (8\% N - 24\% P2O5 - 16\% K2O) and no fertilisation. The initial lime applications improved soil fertility (increasing soil pH, effective exchange capacity, and the saturation percentage of Ca and reducing the saturation percentage of Al) more than the sewage sludge. However, the most significant effects of sewage sludge were found over the long term after high doses of sewage sludge were applied (480 kg total N ha(-1)). Therefore, the use of sewage sludge as a fertiliser improves both soil fertility and the productivity of silvopastoral systems in the long term as long as an adequate disposal of this residue is guaranteed.

	abstract = {After introduction of hybrid under maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation in India it became competitive to rice and found suitable for crop diversification. Due to higher nutrient demand and differential plant type the hybrid needs modification in production technology especially for nutrient and plant geometry. So, this study was conducted in maize-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) (MW) system in western Indo-gangetic plains in sandy loam soil for two consecutive years (2010-12) to explore best maize density and nutrient management in system in order to enhance soil nutrient status and productivity. The results showed that the application of the highest dose of nutrients in maize, i.e. 300: 45.9: 87.5 N:P:K kg/ha resulted in higher organic carbon, macro and micronutrient availability in soil while application of the lowest dose of fertilizer gave significantly higher CEC and available sulphur. Significantly higher CEC, organic carbon and available nutrients were observed in 66 000 plants/ha which gave significantly higher plant height and effective tillers in wheat. The growth and yield attributes of wheat, viz. plant height, effective tillers, spike length, spikelets/spike and spike weight in wheat were significantly higher with residual effect of 300: 45.9: 87.5 N:P:K kg/ha nutrient application in maize which were on par with 250: 39.9: 75.0 N:P:K kg/ha. Amongst the direct nutrient application in wheat significantly higher LCC, SPAD, plant height, effective tillers, spike length, spikelet/spike, and grain weight/spike were recorded with 125\% RDF which were on par with RDF or 75\% RDF. The better nutrition in maize compared to ad-hoc recommendations resulted in significant (P{\textless}0.05) enhancement of system productivity by 17 to 19\%. The direct application of nutrient in wheat gave 14 to 19 higher yield of wheat as well as 6 to 8\% higher yield of the MW system. So, on the basis of two years study it was concluded that growing of maize with 66 000 plants/ha and 250:39.9:75 kg/ha N:P:K application followed by 90:19.8:24.0 kg/ha N:P:K application in wheat may be adopted for higher yield and soil nutrient status in western Indo-gangetic plains.},

Significant build-up in soil fertility in terms of alkaline KMnO4-N, Olsen-P, NH4OAc-K and CaCl2-S as well as SOC pools namely, total organic carbon (TOC), Walkley and Black organic carbon (WBC), labile organic carbon (LBC) and microbial biomass carbon (MBC) were maintained under FYM and integrated nutrient management involving FYM and NPK than unfertilized control plot in 0-15 and 15-30 cm soil depths. The highest values of TOC (11.48 g kg(-1)) and WBC (7.86 g kg(-1)) were maintained in FYM treated plot, while the highest values of LBC(1.36 g kg(-1)) and MBC (273 mg kg(-1)) were found in FYM + NPK. The magnitude of change in pools of SOC in sub-surface (15-30 cm) soil was low as compared to the surface soil (0-15 cm). Significant increase in all the pools of SOC in FYM treated plots indicates the importance of application of organic manure like FYM in maintaining organic carbon in soil. Highly strong relationships were exhibited between LBC and MBC with yield, indicating that these pools are more important for nutrient turn-over and their availability to plants than total SOC. Carbon management index revealed that integrated nutrient management could be followed for enhancing crop productivity, nutrient availability and soil carbon pools for long-term. These results conclude that for sustainable crop production and maintaining soil quality, input of organic manure like FYM is of major importance and should be advocated in the nutrient management of intensive cropping system for improving soil fertility and biological properties of soils.

The results revealed that conjunctive use of organic and inorganic nutrients as well as paddy straw mulch resulted higher yield in both rapeseed and greengram, and the residual effects of different levels of fertilization and mulching also gave rise to higher grain yield in the succeeding rice crop.

	abstract = {The actively heated fiber-optic (AHFO) technology has become emerged as a research focus due to its advantages of distributed, real-time measurement and good durability. These attributes have led to the gradual application of AHFO technology to the water content measurement of in situ soil. However, all existing in situ applications of AHFO technology fail to consider the effect of soil-sensor contact quality on water content measurements, limiting potential for the wider application of AHFO technology. To address this issue, the authors propose a method for determining the soil-sensor thermal contact resistance based on the principle of an infinite cylindrical heat source. This is then used to establish an AHFO water content measurement technology that considers the thermal contact resistance. The reliability and validity of the new measurement technology are explored through a laboratory test and a field case study, and the spatial-temporal evolution of the soil water content in the case is revealed. The results demonstrate that method for determining the soil-sensor thermal contact resistance is highly effective and applicable to all types of soils. This method requires only the moisture content, dry density, and thermal response of the in situ soil to be obtained. In the field case, the measurement error of soil water content between the AHFO method, which takes into account the thermal contact resistance, and the neutron scattering method is only 0.011. The water content of in situ soil exhibits a seasonal variation, with an increase in spring and autumn and a decrease in summer and winter. Furthermore, the response of shallow soils to precipitation and evaporation is significant. These findings contribute to the enhancement of the accuracy of the AHFO technology in the measurement of the water content of in situ soils, thereby facilitating the dissemination and utilization of this technology.

	abstract = {Soil moisture sensing is one of the most important components in smart agriculture. It plays a critical role in increasing crop yields and reducing water waste. However, existing commercial soil moisture sensors are either expensive or inaccurate, limiting their real-world deployment. In this paper, we utilize wide-area LoRa signals to sense soil moisture without a need of dedicated soil moisture sensors. Different from traditional usage of LoRa in smart agriculture which is only for sensor data transmission, we leverage LoRa signal itself as a powerful sensing tool. The key insight is that the dielectric permittivity of soil which is closely related to soil moisture can be obtained from phase readings of LoRa signals. Therefore, antennas of a LoRa node can be placed in the soil to capture signal phase readings for soil moisture measurements. Though promising, it is non-trivial to extract accurate phase information due to unsynchronization of LoRa transmitter and receiver. In this work, we propose to include a low-cost switch to equip the LoRa node with two antennas to address the issue. We develop a delicate chirp ratio approach to cancel out the phase offset caused by transceiver unsynchronization to extract accurate phase information. The proposed system design has multiple unique advantages including high accuracy, robustness against motion interference and large sensing range for large-scale deployment in smart agriculture. Experiments with commodity LoRa nodes show that our system can accurately estimate soil moisture at an average error of 3.1\%, achieving a performance comparable to high-end commodity soil moisture sensors. Field studies show that the proposed system can accurately sense soil moisture even when the LoRa gateway is 100 m away from the LoRa node, enabling wide-area soil moisture sensing for the first time.},

In this study, a pipeline robot system for monitoring SWC distribution is designed to improve the current technical problems of insufficient measurement distance and low positioning accuracy of the existing SWC monitoring platform. The system consists of a pipeline robot, a fixed base station and a PVC pipe. The robot could fit into a 55-mm-diameter PVC pipe to measure SWC distribution horizontally, vertically, or at any angle to the horizontal direction. The base station serves as a data collector and also supplies power and distance information for recharging and positioning the robot, respectively. A series of tests for evaluating the performance of the pipeline robot system were conducted. Field experiments were also conducted to monitor soil water infiltration and horizontal distribution of SWC of crop root zone at three plots. The results showed that the minimum radius of volume of sensitivity of the dielectric sensor is about 2.25 cm. The robot for mobile measurement performed stable both in horizontal and vertical directions and the response of the dielectric sensor output to different dielectric materials is significant. The accumulated error of the encoder is effectively decreased from 4.3\% to 1.2\% by correcting the position error using the laser ranging sensor. The measured SWCs during the calibration experiment were highly correlated with those obtained by the drying method (R-2 = 0.990 and RMSE = 0.0181 cm(3) cm(-3)). The results of the field experiments demonstrated that the system is feasible for monitoring soil water infiltration in the vertical direction and SWC distributions of crop root zone horizontally at the three plots, indicating that the potential application of the developed system for long-term monitoring of SWC distribution under field conditions in the near future.},

It was revealed that the complex dielectric permeability (CDP) affects the readings of sensors using different physical principles in different ways. The results of CDP measurements for six samples are given: river sand, bentonite, three samples of Haplic Chernozem (Loamic) of the Omsk region and a mixture of chernozemic material and river sand. Content of particles less than 0.01 mm in size in the samples varied from 1.7 to 72\%; the content of organic carbon ranged from 0 to 4.12\%. Measurements of CDP were performed at different values of moisture at the frequencies from 10 kHz to 4-8 GHz in the same cell using the original technique developed by authors. It was noted that at frequencies below 20-30 MHz, the dielectric permittivity is an ambiguous function of moisture owing to the strong influence of the conductivity of the soil solution and of interlayer dielectric relaxation on it. Moisture measurements are best to perform in the frequency range 0.5-3 GHz, where the effect of interlayer relaxation and soil solution conductivity on the CDP is negligible. Measurements of soil moisture and conductivity were performed using a Decagon 5TE capacitive sensor. The calibration dependency that is valid for different soils, considering the conductivity of the soil measured by this sensor was found. The error of moisture measurements using this dependency is 0.035 m(3)/m(3). The use of individual calibration dependencies for each of soils reduces the error to 0.014 m(3)/m(3).

Then, the T (2) 1D spectrum distributions were obtained by inverse Laplace transformation. Finally, the results reveal that the area of long T (2) component decreases as the soil moisture content decreases.},

Volumetric Water Content (VWC) or permittivity sensing is conducted by loading the T2-SR side with dielectric samples. Two transmission notches are observed for identical loads relating to T2-SR and CR2-SR. The CR2-SR notch at 4.39 GHz is used as a reference for differential permittivity measurement method. Further, the resonance frequency of T2-SR is measured relative to the reference value. Based on this frequency difference, the permittivity of soil is calculated which is related to the soil VWC. Triangular two-turn resonator (T2-SR) resonance frequency changes from 4 to 2.38 GHz when VWC varies 0\% to 30\%. The sensor's operation principle is described through circuit model analysis and simulations. To validate the differential sensing concept, prototype of the designed 3-cell DSMS is fabricated and measured. The proposed sensor exhibits frequency shift of 110 MHz for 1\% change at the highest soil moisture content (30\%) for sandy-type soil. This work proves the differential microwave sensing concept for precision agriculture.},

Internet-of-Things (IoT) technology is a promising solution for automating irrigation procedures and improving farming efficiency by removing human faults. In this article, a new method is introduced to measure soil moisture level along with providing energy to run a low-power transmitter as an alarm signal. A combination of a metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) and two rectifiers that are designed at different frequencies specifies 5\% and 25\% soil moisture levels. The sensor monitors the soil moisture continuously without consuming energy. Once the soil moisture becomes 5\% of the first rectifier starts working and provides 65 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{uW\}{\textbackslash} dc output, while the second rectifier is off. Increasing the soil moisture to 25\%, the second rectifier creates 100 uW dc output when the first rectifier is off. The designed structure is fabricated on RO4003 in a {\textbackslash}4{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}textbackslashtimes{\textbackslash} {\textbackslash}4{\textbackslash} array. The measurement results are provided by performing a set of different experiments. Initially, the MPA's absorption characteristics are validated facing different polarization and incident angles. Then, the sensing capability is proven by burying the proposed sensor under sand and measuring the dc outputs of rectifiers. A strong correlation between simulation and measurement results validates the design procedure.},

	abstract = {The determination of the amount of moisture in soil is crucial in several application fields such as agricultural, geotechnical, hydrological, and environmental engineering. In this paper, we propose the use of an advanced alloptical self-heated sensing platform for highly sensitive and repeatable monitoring of the soil volumetric water content (VWC). The proposed platform is realized by integrating, inside a standard metallic needle, a fiber optic heating device integrated with a fiber Bragg grating sensor (FBG) acting as thermal monitor. The all optical active heating device consists of two main components: i) a core offset fusion splice between two single mode optical fibers to spread light from the core to the cladding and ii) a metal-coated region of the fiber where the FBG is inscribed. A full characterization of the proposed device has been performed for different VWC values from 9 to 36 \%VWC in the soil temperature range between 5 and 40 degrees C. Collected results demonstrate that the proposed platform is able to perform highly stable, fast, robust and energy efficient measurements of the soil water content, with a repeatability error of 1.5 \%VWC, time response {\textless}= 10 s and resolution {\textless}= 0.25 \%VWC. The possibility of tuning the value of the injected power according to the application makes the proposed sensor extremely flexible and versatile for its exploitation in large areas and/or long-distance monitoring applications with relevant advantages in terms of energy savings, costs and system complexity.},

	abstract = {This article presents a new soil moisture monitoring system (SMMS) for precision agriculture applications. The system consists of a metamaterial-inspired microwave sensor and an electronic backend. The sensor was built on a biodegradable dielectric substrate, emphasizing sustainability, and uses a complementary split-ring resonator (CSRR) coupled to a microstrip line for excitation. This resonator, being a planar artificial structure with metamaterial properties, exhibits composite left/right-handed propagation, thereby displaying sensitivity to the dielectric constant of the applied medium. Accordingly, the sensing mechanism involves establishing a correlation between the soil moisture content and the relative displacement of the sensor's resonance frequency, which varies as the soil's dielectric constant changes due to moisture variations. The backend is controlled by an ESP32 module, which fulfills the tasks of signal capture, processing the data, and delivering the corresponding soil moisture. The transmission of data occurs via Wi-Fi using the MQ telemetry transport (MQTT) protocol. To ensure accuracy, the sensor was calibrated using a gravimetric-based method for sandy and clay soil types. A curve-fitting model was extracted, exhibiting remarkable precision (R-2 = 0.997), enabling the system to detect moisture levels from 0\% to 20\% for both soil types. The overall relative error was found to be 3.6\% for sand and 8.3\% for clay. Finally, the results obtained from the evaluation of the system in typical sandy soil conditions are presented. The system demonstrated its effectiveness by continuously detecting moisture levels ranging from 5\% to 11\% over a duration of 33 h, thereby confirming its viability for practical implementation.},

Recent advancement in microsensors has opened avenues to fabricate low-cost and highly sensitive soil moisture sensors for in situ measurements. For these microsensors, sensing films play a pivotal role, considering the selectivity and sensitivity. In this work, we have explored the Ti3C2Tx MXene two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials as the soil moisture sensor's sensing film. For this purpose, the interdigitated electrodes (IDEs) have been fabricated on the silicon substrate using the micromanufacturing method. To understand the characteristics of the Ti3C2Tx MXene 2D nanomaterials, X-ray diffraction (XRD) is adopted to confirm the structural analysis. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy is carried out to identify the exciting chemical bonds for Ti3C2Tx MXene. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis are used to study the morphology and elemental composition of Ti3AlC2 MAX and Ti3C2Tx MXene phases, respectively. Further, the sensor transfer function has been studied for three different soil samples, viz., clayey soil, loamy sand soil, and sandy loam soil, under laboratory conditions. The performed measurements indicate that the response of fabricated soil moisture sensors is about 500, 2400, and 1700\% for the clayey, loamy sand, and sandy loam soils at 300 Hz, respectively, for the gravimetric water content (GWC) ranging from 1 to 18\% GWC. Interestingly, the hysteresis of the fabricated sensor on the loamy sand soil is about +/- 1\% GWC, whereas for the sandy loam and clayey soils, it is around +/- 3 and +/- 6\% GWC, respectively. Further, the fabricated sensor shows a high selectivity toward the water molecule when compared with the other ions (Cu+, Cd+, Na+, and K+) in the soil samples.},

	abstract = {Accurate acquisition of in-situ soil water content is of great significance for mastering the water content distribution of unsaturated soil and understanding soil engineering properties. The actively heated fiber-optic (AHFO) method has recently become a research focus because of the capability to realize distributed and real-time measurement of soil water content. However, most reported AHFO systems have been coupled to distributed temperature sensing (DTS) which does not allow for remote measurements with high spatial resolution. In this paper, a new AHFO method based on the quasi-distributed fiber Bragg grating (AHFO-FBG) technique is proposed for the large-scale in-situ measurement of soil water content. An AHFO-FBG in-situ monitoring system is developed which consists of a sensor module, heating module, data acquisition and transmission module, and data processing module. The established system is applied to a loess slope in Yan'an City, Shaanxi Province, China to monitor its water content distribution in real time. The effectiveness of the monitoring system is verified and the water content distribution of the monitored loess slope are analysed. The in-situ measurement results indicate that in the spatial dimension, the water content in the top and bottom of the slope is low, and that near the scarp is high; in the time dimension, the water content in winter is low while that in autumn and spring is high. The monitored results also suggest that soil water evaporation in winter can significantly enhance the spatial distribution difference of soil water content.},

	abstract = {Near-surface soil water content (NSWC) is an important parameter for characterizing hydrological processes, water and vapor exchange at the soil-atmosphere boundary, and potential biological productivity. Here we develop a dielectric based frequency-domain (FD) impedance sensor operating at 100 MHz, with a novel coaxial probe design and a temperature sensor embedded in the circuit board. This perforated cylinder coaxial (PCC) sensor provides simultaneous measurements of volumetric soil water content (VSWC) and of temperature. The temperature measurement allows signal correction for the temperature response of the circuit board and of the permittivity of soil water. We characterize the performance of the PCC sensor and compare it with alternative 3-pin- and 2-pin-electrode FD impedance sensors each using a similarly performing circuit board. A series of theoretical analyses and experiments were conducted, including (i) sensors calibration, (ii) temperature effects and their correction, (iii) soil volume sensed by each sensor through simulation analysis and a stepwise soil removal (SSR) test and (iv) accuracy comparison of the three sensors when applied for the NSWC measurements. The calibration results verified that the PCC, 3-pin and 2-pin probes were suitable to measure VSWC (RMSE {\textless}= 0.0142 cm(3) cm(-3)). The simulation analysis using High Frequency Structure Simulator software (HFSS) indicated that the novel PCC probe had a symmetrical distribution of the E-field, wholly contained within the cylinder, avoiding leakage of the E-Field into air at the soil-atmosphere interface and removing the dependency of sensed volume on VSWC. The results of the SSR test showed that the E-field distributed outside the receiving electrode of the PCC probe could be ignored whereas that of both pin-type electrodes was distributed outside of the receiving electrode to a distance that depended on VSWC (i.e. up to 8 mm for 3-pin and up to 11 mm for 2-pin designs when VSWC {\textgreater} 0.17 cm(3) cm(-3)), which corresponds to the simulation analysis. Moreover, the new PCC probe provided more accurate NSWC measurement than 3-pin or 2-pin probes because the E-field was contained within the perforated cylinder, avoiding E-field leakage and fixing sensed soil volume independent of VSWC. The pin-structure probes appear to perform best when installed horizontally in the soil at least 11 mm below the surface.},

Surface irrigation is one the most widely adopted method of irrigation due to its simplicity and low energy requirement. Although, it is mostly associated with poor irrigation application efficiency mainly due to deep percolation and uneven distribution of irrigation water. A study was conducted in closed-end level basin layout in loamy soil to establish and test an Internet of Things (IoT) based system through a wireless connection between the automatic check gate and soil moisture sensors which can be operated remotely based on real-time soil moisture status. An attempt had been made to identify the suitable location of the sensor in the basin layout for improving irrigation application efficiency. An aluminium automatic-check gate fitted in an iron frame was placed in the concrete water supply channel to control the water flow. Three capacitance-based soil moisture sensors were placed at 25\%, 50\% and 75\% of field length (i.e., 15 m, 30 m and 45 m) at 37.5, 15 cm and 7.5 cm depth, respectively. A wireless communication network was established between capacitance-based soil moisture sensors and an automatic check gate through the LoRa module and GSM module. The software used for automatic control of the check gate in this study was Croplytics (R) by Agsmartic. The system was tested for nine irrigation events under bare soil conditions. Three different operational schedules based on different soil moisture sensor placement had been tested under 40\%, 30\% and 20\% soil moisture deficit conditions. The results suggested that the best location of sensors for closing the system would be at 37.5 cm depth placed at 25\% length from the inlet in higher soil moisture deficit condition and at 7.5 cm depth placed at 75\% length in low moisture deficit condition. Overall, the irrigation application efficiency was improved up to 86.6\% with automation.},

Soil tensiometers are the instruments used for measuring soil matric potential to monitor soil moisture content. The tensiometer contains a vacuum gauge for the visual indication for irrigation managers to monitor field moisture within the maximum allowable deficit. The vacuum gauge has the limitation that it does not provide its output in the form of an electrical signal, which is used as input for an automatic irrigation system. So, the present work was carried out to develop and evaluate a piezoresistive-based soil moisture sensors system for precise irrigation scheduling through automation devices. The experiment was carried out in the Centre for Protected Cultivation Technology, IARI, New Delhi, and it contains sandy loam soil. The development of a piezoresistive-based sensor for automatic irrigation scheduling can be done by using a piezoresistive sensor, XBee transmitter and receiver, microcontroller, water meter, and relay unit. Once development was completed, it was tested and compared with a conventional tensiometer at different chrysanthemum and tomato crop depths. The relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of soil moisture content for tensiometer and piezoresistive-based soil moisture sensor varied from 9.47 to 19.38 and 7.44 to 18.28, respectively. The coefficient of determination for tensiometer and piezoresistive-based soil moisture varies from 0.71 to 0.72 and 0.82 to 0.84, respectively.

The folding ruler approximation is employed to calculate the sound velocity of the soil, which is then inverted to determine the soil moisture content. The experiment measured the soil within a two-dimensional area formed by the seismic source and the acoustic sensing optical cable. The sensing optical cable and the active seismic source are organized into a two-dimensional area and the measurement range is 3 x 10 m with 33 points. The SMC ranges from 15\% to 40\%. The experiment shows that the absolute error between the measured values obtained by DAS and the water cut meter is 7\%.

	abstract = {The detection of soil moisture is one of the most important researches in the development of precision agriculture. At present, the detection of soil dielectric constant is the most effective and convenient method to measure soil moisture content. Most of the dielectric type soil moisture sensors reduce the influence of soil salinity, texture and other factors on the measurement by detecting at high frequency. However, this will increase the production cost of the measurement circuit and fail to meet the requirements for large-scale deployment of sensors in agricultural production. The method of low-frequency capacitance detection has a price advantage but a low measurement accuracy, thus the application is very limited. This paper intends to improve the measurement accuracy and application range of low-frequency capacitance moisture sensors by correcting the relationship between low-frequency capacitance and moisture through the detection of soil conductivity. Three modified models (logistic, exponential and polynomial) to estimate the moisture content was verified by comparing with the oven-drying method calibration value. The results indicated that the MAME and MAE of the logistic model was less than 3.55\% and 2.50\%, respectively, which can satisfy most agricultural production requirements for soil moisture detection. Therefore, the study provided an effective detection method for low-cost soil moisture detection in low salinity and low organic matter soils. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Real-time monitoring of soil water content is of great significance to prevent many engineering accidents, such as landslide, water seepage of foundation dam, and reduction of foundation bearing capacity. Electromechanical impedance (EMI) technique based smart aggregates (SAs) have showed excellent monitoring capability in various engineering applications. However, there are limited reports on the application of EMI based SAs in the monitoring of the soil water content. In this paper, the EMI based spherical SAs (SSAs) were investigated in the monitoring of soil water content. Firstly, the SSAs were designed and fabricated using the monolithic concrete encapsulation method, and their stable performance in air were evaluated, and confirmed by testing and analyzing the impedance spectrum. Then, the fabricated SSAs were immersed in the water environment for 28 d to ensure the stability under the working conditions, such as the soil with high water content and the hydration process of early-age concrete. Secondly, the monitoring experiments of soil water content were carried out based on the SSAs and the traditional SAs using the EMI technique. The measured impedance signatures under different water contents in soil were quantified by three types of statistical indexes, including root mean square deviation, mean absolute percentage deviation, and correlation coefficient deviation. The experimental results show that compared with the traditional SAs, the SSAs are more sensitive and stable to monitor the soil water content. Finally, the effect of temperature on the performance of SSA based on the EMI technique were conducted experimentally. The results demonstrate that temperature has influence on the monitoring results of the SSAs based on the EMI technique.},

	abstract = {In order to realize the dynamic analysis of regional soil moisture content in the upper reaches of Xiashan Reservoir in Weihe River Basin, Weifang City, Shandong Province, a regional soil moisture dynamic analysis model based on hyperspectral remote sensing technology is proposed. The process of predicting and deducing the soil water content through the spectral information of remote sensing images, surface parameters and other data can reflect the soil spectral information. The band sensitive to the change of soil moisture in remote sensing image is directly extracted, which is used as the independent variable input in the soil water logging inversion model, and the process of soil moisture prediction is conducted with the measured soil moisture value as the dependent variable input. The SI-1, SI-2 and other water spectral indexes that can reflect the water information are constructed, and the water spectral index used for soil water content retrieval is constructed through various relationships between bands. Compared with the spectral reflectance alone, the use of water spectral index greatly improves the retrieval accuracy. The particle filter algorithm is used to assimilate the observed data and simulated data to obtain the assimilated soil moisture. Error evaluation indicators are used to evaluate the accuracy of the obtained assimilation results and further use different particle numbers and observation errors to conduct multiple data assimilation experiments to explore the sensitivity of particle numbers and observation errors to the assimilation results. The root mean square error (RMSE), relative error (RE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to test and verify the effect of data assimilation. The test shows that the dynamic analysis of the regional soil moisture content in the upper reaches of Xiashan Reservoir in the Fangwei River basin by using this method the distribution map obtained by dividing the vegetation coverage are more consistent with the actual situation in terms of the proportion of different soil water salinization degrees, the regional distribution of water, etc. The idea of using hyperspectral remote sensing to retrieve soil moisture is effective.},

Sensing technology has been used for a long time to determine the exact amount of soil nutrients without going through a conventional time-consuming, and expensive laboratory testing process. Several types of sensors are developed to measure the quantity of Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) present in the soil, basically known as NPK sensor that provides on-the-go detection. A significant need for compact, inexpensive, low-power, and rapid soil NPK sensors is anticipated due to the demand for enhanced agriculture production and the future widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT). This fact implies using advanced technologies for both sensing elements and rapid detection. In recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have also been utilized to optimize soil NPK levels. These techniques involve training models on large datasets of soil samples and their corresponding nutrient levels, allowing for accurate prediction of nutrient concentrations based on sensor data. Only the sensing devices primarily used in agriculture applications will be discussed in this review. The prominent technologies and methods used in agriculture will be explored with regard to research and development ever held in agricultural sensing devices for measuring soil parameters. These elementary methods of determining the soil parameters may be grouped into two classes: conventional and emerging. We expect this review to guide the researchers and provide an approach to the study related to producing a convenient, affordable, and efficient soil NPK detection sensor.},

	abstract = {The use of precision agriculture is becoming more and more necessary to provide food for the world's growing population, as well as to reduce environmental impact and enhance the usage of limited natural resources. One of the main drawbacks that hinder the use of precision agriculture is the cost of technological immersion in the sector. For farmers, it is necessary to provide low-cost and robust systems as well as reliability. Toward this end, this paper presents a wireless sensor network of low-cost sensor nodes for soil moisture that can help farmers optimize the irrigation processes in precision agriculture. Each wireless node is composed of four soil moisture sensors that are able to measure the moisture at different depths. Each sensor is composed of two coils wound onto a plastic pipe. The sensor operation is based on mutual induction between coils that allow monitoring the percentage of water content in the soil. Several prototypes with different features have been tested. The prototype that has offered better results has a winding ratio of 1:2 with 15 and 30 spires working at 93 kHz. We also have developed a specific communication protocol to improve the performance of the whole system. Finally, the wireless network was tested, in a real, cultivated plot of citrus trees, in terms of coverage and received signal strength indicator (RSSI) to check losses due to vegetation.},

The resulting accurate theta measurements (RMSE = 0.03 m(3)m(-3)) were used to characterize the spatial variability of theta across scales and to develop an empirical equation that can correct for the changes in the theta spatial variability observed at different spatial resolutions. In addition, the number of required samples to accurately characterize theta and its variability over scales ranging from 5 m and 350 m were estimated.

	abstract = {In this work, we propose a novel and cost effective fiber optic platform for the continuous monitoring of soil water content to be exploited in the agri-food sector and, in particular, in the field of precision agriculture to promote the rational use of water resources. The proposed platform arises from the judicious connection of optical fiber technology and functional materials able to exhibit a change in their optical properties depending on the water content in the environment. Al2O3 disks have been used as functional materials, taking advantage of their capability to absorb water and exhibit a correlated absorbance increase in the wavelength range corresponding to the absorption peak of water. A detailed study has been carried out to obtain the best coupling conditions between optical fibers and the functional disk. The final prototype has been tested directly in soil and the collected results show its capability to detect soil water content variation in the range 0-35\% of volumetric water content (VWC) with a sensitivity of 2.3\%/\%VWC and a VWC resolution lower than 1\%. Such performances allow the proposed device to be used for soil water content measurements for applications in several fields and in different hydrogeological conditions, such as, e.g., in smart farming applications, to support farmers in defining a correct irrigation strategy, or for the real-time monitoring of hydrogeological hazard, to prevent rainfall-induced landslide. Moreover, thanks to the capability of optical fibers technology to multiplex different fiber probes while sharing the same interrogation equipment, the proposed platform is endowed with multiplexing capabilities and presents a solid basis for a continuous monitoring of soil moisture monitoring over large areas.},

	abstract = {Water shortages have increasingly become a global issue due to the acceleration of climate change. The consumption of freshwater can be reduced to a minimum using water irrigation techniques that are based on conservative methods. For example, one of these is precision irrigation, or PI, which uses advanced digital technology to regulate the amount of water used. The aim is to use the least amount of water necessary for a given purpose. This approach keeps consumption to a minimum while the amount remains effective for its purpose. It is also important to note that the variability which occurs in soil and crops will create different types of conditions. These different conditions will need to be studied so as to determine the correct and adequate dynamics for a water management approach that is efficient. In this study, three investigation methods were developed and compared. The first evaluation was performed on outputs from the geoelectric reading of Automatic Resistivity Profiling (ARP). A second evaluation was performed in real time via a sensor network placed in the soil for the duration of two growing seasons of two different crops. The last evaluation was carried out by using maps of spectral indices obtained by the Sentinel 2 satellites. The correlations between the three methods were evaluated to verify if satellite information may have significant potential in the use of water management in varying conditions. From the results obtained, some correlations have been found from the observations of the three systems under study. This has given a positive input towards using satellite maps which are integrated with simplified proximal sensor networks. The outcome of this technique can improve the efficiency of how to manage water distribution on cultivated land.},

KLDAS soil moisture is benchmarked against three global products: the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS NET) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) satellite product. The evaluation is performed using in situ measurements for 2013-2015 and one month standardized precipitation index (SPI-1) for 1982-2016, focusing on four major river basins in South Korea. The KLDAS outperforms all benchmark products in capturing soil moisture states and variability at a basin scale. Compared to GLDAS and FLDAS products, the EAS CCI product is not feasible for long term agricultural monitoring due to lower data quality for early periods (1979-1991) of soil moisture estimates. KLDAS shows that the most recent 2015 drought event leads to highest drought areas in the Han and Geum River basins in the past 35 years. This work supports KLDAS as an effective agricultural drought monitoring system to provide continuous regional high-resolution soil moisture estimates in South Korea.},

A poor nutrient management technique results in an imbalance in the soil nutrient status which could have a long-term negative impact on crop production. The current study was carried out to assess the effect of different rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on soil nutrient balance in a maize-wheat cropping system in Cambisols of Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal during 2019/20 and 2020/21. The experiment included three-factor randomized complete block design with three doses of each N, P, and K which was replicated three times. There was a remarkable change in soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N, P, and K contents of soil over a period of time with the application of different doses of NPK. Soil pH changed from 5.98 to 5.53, SOC increased from 11.7 to 16.8 g center dot kg(-1), total N decreased from 1264 to 1177 mg center dot kg(,)(-1) available P2O5 declined from 214 to 63.6 mg center dot kg(,)(-1) and available K2O decreased from 71.7 to 24.8 mg center dot kg(-1) with varying rates of NPK after four cropping seasons. Furthermore, partial, apparent, and net N, P, K balance were predominantly negative in all the fertilizer treatments, but the magnitude was lower under higher nutrient rates and positive partial N balance was noticed in higher N levels. The depletion of native P and K pools even at higher application rates was attributed to higher crop removal over time as compared to inputs. Therefore, continuous application of balanced fertilizers is crucial in maintaining the fertility of soil and productivity of crops.},

Drying-induced ground subsidence and damage to overlying buildings is a widespread and urgent problem. Monitoring of drying-induced water evaporation in soil is of great importance. In this paper, soil moisture loss monitoring based on lead zirconate titanate (PZT) transducer using electro-mechanical impedance (EMI) technique was investigated. A physical model test in our laboratory was conducted to study the feasibility and applicability. In the experimental research, three identical PZT transducers that were wrapped with waterproof insulation glue were pre-embedded inside a cohesive soil specimen. In addition, another PZT transducer was embedded in a sandy soil specimen to explore the application effect in soil with different composition. EMI signatures of these four PZT patches during the air-drying process were collected and analyzed. Experimental results indicated that the peak frequency in the conductance signatures presented a rightward shift as the water evaporates. Moreover, the corresponding peak magnitude keep decreasing with the continuous development of soil moisture loss. To better quantify the variations, two statistical metrics including root mean square deviation (RMSD) and mean absolute percentage deviation (MAPD) were employed to study the changing characteristics of the EMI signatures. All these two metrics increase coincidentally in the process. Experimental results demonstrate that cohesive and sandy soil moisture loss monitoring by using the embedded PZT transducer is feasible and reliable. This work also serves as a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the performance of the EMI technique in monitoring the soil moisture content.},

Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an similar to 9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales ({\textless}= 10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.},

This study is aimed at the evaluation of OPTRAM for field scale precision agriculture applications using ultrahigh spatial resolution optical observations obtained with one of the world's largest field robotic phenotyping scanners located in Maricopa, Arizona. We replaced NDVI with the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), which has been shown to be more accurate for cropped agricultural fields that transition from bare soil to dense vegetation cover. The OPTRAM was parameterized based on the trapezoidal geometry of the pixel distribution within the TRSWIR-SAVI space, from which wet- and dry-edge parameters were determined. The accuracy of the resultant SM estimates is evaluated based on a comparison with ground reference measurements obtained with Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors deployed to monitor surface, near-surface and root zone SM. The obtained results indicate an SM estimation error between 0.045 and 0.057 cm(3) cm(-3) for the near-surface and root zone, respectively. The high resolution SM maps clearly capture the spatial SM variability at the sensor locations. These findings and the presented framework can be applied in conjunction with Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) observations to assist with farm scale precision irrigation management to improve water use efficiency of cropping systems and conserve water in water-limited regions of the world.},

Thanks to the cancellation of supply voltage variations, the modeling of the GWC sensor and readout circuit was correct. The results we measured were close to modeled values. The maximum measurement resolution of the capacitive moisture sensor was 0.07 pF. To get the GWC from measured capacitance, a scale was used to weigh the mass of water in the soil. The comparison between capacitance measurement and calculated soil GWC is presented. The RFID measurement system has energy harvesting capabilities and an ultra-low power microcontroller, which uses embedded software to control the measurement properties.

	abstract = {Readily available moisture in the root zone is very important for optimum plant growth. The available techniques to determine soil moisture content have practical limitations owing to their high cost, dependence on labor, and time consumption. We have developed a prototype for automated soil moisture monitoring using a low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensor (SKU:SEN0193) for data acquisition, connected to the internet. A soil-specific calibration was performed to integrate the sensor with the automated soil moisture monitoring system. The accuracy of the soil moisture measurements was compared with those of a gravimetric method and a well-established soil moisture sensor (SM-200, Delta-T Devices Ltd, Cambridge, UK). The root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the soil water contents obtained with the SKU:SEN0193 sensor function, the SM-200 manufacturer's function, and the SM-200 soil-specific calibration function were 0.09, 0.07, and 0.06 cm(3) cm(-3), for samples in the dry to saturated range, and 0.05, 0.08, and 0.03 cm(3) cm(-3), for samples in the field capacity range. The repeatability of the measurements recorded with the developed calibration function support the potential use of the SKU:SEN0193 sensor to minimize the risk of soil moisture stress or excess water application.},

The sensor is designed to determine the soil water content (SWC) of various soil types. The operational principle relies on the modulation of two resonance frequencies of the antenna due to changes in the relative permittivity of the material under test (MUT). The sensor's sensitivity was thoroughly examined and compared with various sensors documented in the literature. Additionally, an electric field analysis was conducted, revealing that optimizing the dimensions of the CSRR can enhance its sensitivity.

In this study, a new temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) to quantify surface soil moisture (SSM) is proposed. It is defined as a function of land surface temperature variation and its relationship to surface water availability. The spatial pattern of TMDI has been analyzed over two time points of dry and rainy seasons for the plain area of Tainan, Taiwan, using Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI)/Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) image acquired on January 20 and October 19, 2014. The effectiveness of TMDI in reflecting the SSM status was then evaluated by the results of the simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and verified by the near-surface air temperature (T-air) and humidity (RHair) measured by the ground-based weather stations. The results indicated that TMDI exhibited a significantly negative correlation with the simulated ET and positive correlation with in situ measured T-air from seven stations (r = -0.95 and -0.9 for simulated ET and r = 0.94 and 0.78 for T-air corresponding to January 20 and October 19, respectively). We further compared the performance of the TMDI with the existing remotely sensed dryness assessment methods, including temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) and Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL) model. The advantages of the TMDI in reflecting SSM, especially in the nonvegetation area, are clearly demonstrated. It is concluded that the TMDI is a reliable indicator for determining the SSM status with a large degree of freedom for further applications since it does not require any other ground-based measurements.},

The antenna sensor has a wider detection range of SWC, ranging from 10\% to 44\%, and a novel metamaterial structure electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) is designed and its function in improving sensitivity is verified. Furthermore, by sputtering 60-nm-thick SiO2 film on the surface of the antenna patch, its sensitivity has also been greatly improved. When the SiO(2 )film is sputtered on the antenna sensor, its sensitivity is 7.2 MHz/\% and 7.6 MHz/\% when the SWC is 10\%-29\% and 30\%-44\%, respectively. In summary, this work contributes to methods and instruments for wireless measurement of the SWC.},

In this study, we proposed a spatial downscaling method for SM based on random forest considering soil moisture memory and mass conservation to improve downscaling performance. The lagged SM was added as a predictor to represent soil moisture memory, in addition to the regular predictors in previous downscaling studies. The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM data of the Pearl River Basin were used to test our downscaling method. The results show that the downscaling model obtained good performance on the test set (R-2 = 0.848, ubRMSE = 0.034 m(3)/m(3) and Bias = 0.008 m(3)/m(3)). The spatial and temporal performance of the RF downscaling model can be improved by adding lagged SM variables. Downscaled data obtained can retain the information of the original SMAP SM data well and show more spatial details, and mass conservation correction is considered to be useful to eliminate systematic bias of the downscaling model. Downscaled SM achieved acceptable performance in in situ validation, though it was inevitably limited by the performance of the original SMAP data. The proposed downscaling method can serve as a powerful tool for the development of high-resolution SM information.},

To improve soil moisture estimates under a wide range of climate regimes, this study developed a nonlinear enhanced soil moisture downscaling model and evaluated it at a typical microwave resolution over the contiguous China. The enhanced model clearly outperforms the conventional approach in estimating surface soil moisture by reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.175 vol/vol to 0.075 vol/vol under wet climate.

Fluctuation in the heat power and the longitudinal heat transfer are the main sources of errors. Artificial neural network (ANN) models can effectively improve monitoring accuracy.

	abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) interference signal has gained wide interests in recent years. It utilizes the variation pattern of the routinely measured Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) that contains the interference information between the direct and soil reflected signal. Previous studies have shown that the amplitude of the de-trended SNR data is not a good indicator for soil moisture variation. The possible cause found in this study is that the de-trending operation only reduces the additive direct signal component in the SNR data, while the multiplicative direct signal component in the amplitude of SNR data is unaffected. Therefore, a method is proposed to reduce the contamination of the direct signal component on the amplitude through signal reconstruction and then normalization. Experiment data are collected and processed to calculate the normalized amplitude based on the reconstruction method. The results show that the overall correlation coefficient of the normalized amplitude with in-situ soil moisture reaches to 0.6966 under highly rough surface condition, while it is only 0.4314 for the amplitude obtained from the conventional method. A quadratic model is used to retrieve soil moisture from the normalized amplitude, the retrieval error is less than 0.085 cm(3) cm(-3).},

These devices harvest environmental energy resources to supply their power and transfer their collected data using wireless RF links. In many instances, the power supplied from the environment is far less than the power required by the sensor device. In this case, the main solution is to accumulate energy on a storage element, and when enough energy is stored, the sensor node is instantaneously activated using an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit. During this short time burst, the sensor performs the required acquisition, transmits the results, and enters a sleep mode until again enough energy is collected. The quiescent current of the UVLO is the main factor that determines the minimum power level at which the sensor node is still operational. Most wake-up circuits used in conventional devices suffer from a quiescent current of a few hundred nanoamperes. In this article, using a zero-bias-current MOSFET-based approach, a new wake-up circuitry is presented, which lowers the quiescent current down to the picoampere range. As a practical application, the effectiveness of the proposed circuit is shown in the soil moisture monitoring sensor setup.},

This study presents a directional shielding approach to prevent neutrons from certain angles from being counted while counting neutrons entering the detector from other angles and explores its potential to gain a sharper horizontal view on the surrounding soil moisture distribution. Using the Monte Carlo code URANOS (Ultra Rapid Neutron-Only Simulation), we modelled the effect of additional polyethylene shields on the horizontal field of view and assessed its impact on the epithermal count rate, propagated uncertainties and aggregation time. The results demonstrate that directional CRNS measurements are strongly dominated by isotropic neutron transport, which dilutes the signal of the targeted direction especially from the far field. For typical count rates of customary CRNS stations, directional shielding of half-spaces could not lead to acceptable precision at a daily time resolution.

To date, there is still a lack of simple, fast and reasonable methods for soil moisture measurement at pixel scale between point measurements and remote sensing observations. In this study, a measurement method of soil moisture using ground-penetrating radar (GPR) was proposed for pixel scale. We used a PulseEKKOTM PRO GPR system with 250 MHz antennas to measure soil moisture by Fixed Offset (FO) method in four 30 x 30 m(2) plots chosen from the desert steppe. This study used a random combination method to analyze soil moisture measurements acquired by different numbers of GPR survey lines. The results showed that two survey lines of GPR would be sufficient under confidence level of 90\% with the relative error of 7\%, and four survey lines of GPR would be eligible under confidence level of 95\% with the relative error of 5\% for each plot. GPR measurement can reproduce the spatial distribution of soil moisture with higher resolution and smaller error, especially when two and four survey lines are designed in cross shape and grid shape, respectively. The method was applied to ground validation for the soil moisture from Landsat 8, showing the advantages of stable relative errors, less contingency and reliable evaluation when compared to point measurements. This method is fast and convenient and not limited to a certain pixel, and thus largely benefits the scale matching of remote sensing results and field measurements in ground validation.},

	abstract = {Agricultural land in the south of Iraq provides habitat for several types of living creatures. This land has a significant impact on the ecosystem. The agricultural land of Al-Hawizeh marsh covers an area of more than 3500 km(2)and is considered an enriched resource to produce several harvests. A total of 74\% of this area suffers from a high degree of salinity and chemical pollution, which needs to be remedied. Several human-made activities and post-war-related events have caused radical deterioration in soil quality in the agricultural land. The goal of this research was to integrate mathematical models, remote sensing data, and GIS to provide a powerful tool to predict, assess, monitor, manage, and map the salinity and chemical parameters of iron (Fe), lead (Pb), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), and zinc (Zn) in the soils of agricultural land in Al-Hawizeh marsh in southern Iraq during the four seasons of 2017. The mathematical model consists of four parts. The first depends on the B6 and B11 bands of Landsat-8, to calculate the soil moisture index (SMI). The second is the salinity equation (SE), which depends on the SMI result to retrieve the salinity values from Landsat-8 images. The third part depends on the B6 and B7 bands of Landsat-8, which calculates the clay chemical index (CCIs). The fourth part is the chemical equation (CE), which depends on the CCI to retrieve the chemical values (Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) from Landsat-8 images. The average salinity concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 1175, 1010, 1105, and 1789 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Fe concentrations during autumn, summer, spring and winter were 813, 784, 842, and 1106 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Pb concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 4.85, 3.79, 4.74, and 7.2 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Cu concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 3.9, 3.1, 4.45, and 7.5 mg/dm(3), respectively. The average Cr concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter seasons were 1.28, 0.73, 1.03, and 2.91 mg/dm(3), respectively. Finally, the average Zn concentrations during autumn, summer, spring, and winter were 8.25, 6, 7.05, and 12 mg/dm(3), respectively. The results show that the concentrations of salinity and chemicals decreased in the summer and increased in the winter. The decision tree (DT) classification depended on the output results for salinity and chemicals for both SE and CE equations. This classification refers to all the parameters simultaneously in one stage. The output of DT classification results can display all the soil quality parameters (salinity, Fe, Pb, Cu, Cr, and Zn) in one image. This approach was repeated for each season in this study. In conclusion, the developed systematic and generic approach may constitute a basis for determining soil quality parameters in agricultural land worldwide.},

Then, maps based on SMOS-SM and in situ indices were created for July from 2010 to 2015 to identify the spatial pattern of drought distributions. Our results showed that the SMOS-SM product had relatively high correlation with in situ indices, especially SPI and SPEI values of a nine-month scale for the growing season. The drought patterns shown on maps generated from SPI-9, SPEI-9 and sc-PDSI were also successfully captured using the SMOS-SM product.

Climate scientists seek to accurately measure N flux to the atmosphere, farmers want to maximize plant N uptake and reduce input costs, and industries land-applying wastewater must mitigate potential N leaching to drinking water supplies. The need to quantify denitrification rates of wastewater disposed of by vegetable processing and cheese making industries in Wisconsin drove the development of an autonomous high-throughput in situ sampling and analysis system for soil N flux. The system was deployed to six unique industry sites with different soil types for 7 days once per quarter and data collected continuously. Additional seasonal data collection allowed for the determination of system N mass balances. The system can deliver quality data under challenging conditions where staffing would be impractical and provide detailed information about soil gas emissions under a range of environmental conditions.},

The proposed system is composed of a waveguide, containing Tx and Rx antennas, and an electronic circuit driven by a microcontroller (MCU). It will be shown how the system provides a useful and fast estimation of moisture on a silty clay loam soil characterized by a moisture range of about 9\% to 32\% and a soil temperature ranging from about 8 degrees C and 18 degrees C. Using the PLS approach, the moisture content can be predicted with an R-2 value of 0.892, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.0\%, and a residual prediction deviation (RPD) of 4.3.

During extended drought periods moisture replenishment is only available by capillary rise from the groundwater. However, moisture flux is often hindered by capillary barriers in the interface between layers of contrasting textures. The results of HYDRUS-1D simulations run on multilayered soil profiles were integrated into textural maps to determine the spatial distribution of water dynamics on the floodplain of the Drava River (SW Hungary). Model runs and field data revealed limited moisture replenishment by capillary rise when both contrasting textural interfaces and sandy layers are present in the profile. By implementing these textural and hydraulic relations, a drought vulnerability map (DSA map) of the operational area of the Old Drava Programme (ODP) was developed. According to the spatial distribution of soils of reduced capillary rise, 52\% of the ODP area is likely threatened by droughts. Our model results are adaptable for optimisation of land- and water-management practices along the floodplains of low-energy and medium-sized rivers under humid continental and maritime climates.},

The enabling technologies still rely on simple design and low cost, but the systems are more complex. The LoRa-based system combined with a machine learning approach can be used for the estimation of soil moisture by using signal strength data, but for the improvement of the system performance we propose the optimization of the antenna for underground use. The soil properties are frequency-dependent and varying in time, which may cause variations in the signal wavelength and input impedance of the antenna underground. Instead of using wideband antenna design or standard helical antenna provided in LoRa module, which are typical in the IoUT research community for communication links, we propose a narrow-band antenna design for the application in soil moisture sensing. It is shown that the approach of simply matching the antenna buried in dry sand can provide a substantial signal level difference, ranging from approximately 10 dB (achieved by proof-of-concept measurements) to as much as 40 dB (calculated by a full wave simulator) in reflection coefficient when the moisture content is being increased by 20\%. This can ensure more reliable radio sensing in novel sensorless technology where soil moisture information is extracted from the signal strength of a transmitting device.},

Surface soil moisture (SSM) prediction can be used to plan irrigation, monitor water quality, manage water resources, and estimate agricultural production. Multi-source remote sensing is a crucial tool for assessing SSM in agricultural areas. The field-measured SSM sample data are required in model building and accuracy assessment of SSM inversion using remote sensing data. When the SSM samples are insufficient, the SSM inversion accuracy is severely affected. An SSM inversion method suitable for a small sample size was proposed. The alpha approximation method was employed to expand the measured SSM samples to offer more training data for SSM inversion models. Then, feature parameters were extracted from Sentinel-1 microwave and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, and optimized using three methods, which were Pearson correlation analysis, random forest (RF), and principal component analysis. Then, three common machine learning models suitable for small sample training, which were RF, support vector regression, and genetic algorithm-back propagation neural network, were built to retrieve SSM. Comparison experiments were carried out between various feature optimization methods and machine learning models. The experimental results showed that after sample augmentation, SSM inversion accuracy was enhanced, and the combination of utilizing RF for feature screening and RF for SSM inversion had a higher accuracy, with a coefficient of determination of 0.7256, a root mean square error of 0.0539 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error of 0.0422 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. The proposed method was finally used to invert the regional SSM of the study area. The inversion results indicated that the proposed method had good performance in regional applications with a small sample size.},

The results indicated that the main issue with this device is that its SWC determinations are only accurate within a limited soil salinity and temperature range. Conversely, the organic matter, texture, clay content and bulk density have no direct impact on the sensors' accuracy. The sensors work best when the soil salinity and temperature are 2.5 dS m(-1) and 25 degrees C, respectively. This sensor can be used appropriately after calibration when the soil salinity and temperatures are within the 1.9-4.0 dS m(-1) and 16-30 degrees C ranges, respectively. When the soil salinity and temperature values are higher or lower than these ranges, the sensors do not work accurately.

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays an important role in the partitioning of rainfall into evapotranspiration, infiltration, and runoff, hence a vital state variable in hydrological modelling. However, due to the heterogeneity of soil moisture in space, most existing in situ observation networks rarely provide sufficient coverage to capture the catchment-scale soil moisture variations. Clearly, there is a need to develop a systematic approach for soil moisture network design, so that with the minimal number of sensors the catchment spatial soil moisture information could be captured accurately. In this study, a simple and low-data requirement method is proposed. It is based on principal component analysis (PCA) for the investigation of the network redundancy degree and K-means cluster analysis (CA) and a selection of statistical criteria for the determination of the optimal sensor number and placements. Furthermore, the long-term (10-year) 5 km surface soil moisture datasets estimated through the advanced Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model are used as the network design inputs. In the case of the Emilia-Romagna catchment, the results show the proposed network is very efficient in estimating the catchment-scale surface soil moisture (i.e. with NSE and r at 0.995 and 0.999, respectively, for the areal mean estimation; and 0.973 and 0.990, respectively, for the areal standard deviation estimation). To retain 90 \% variance, a total of 50 sensors in a 22 124 km(2) catchment is needed, and in comparison with the original number of WRF grids (828 grids), the designed network requires significantly fewer sensors. However, refinements and investigations are needed to further improve the design scheme, which are also discussed in the paper.},

This study evaluated the measurement accuracy and repeatability of the EC-5 and 5TM soil volumetric water content (SVWC) sensors, the MPS-2 and 200SS soil water potential (SWP) sensors, and the 200TS soil temperature sensor. Six 183 cm x 183 cm x 71 cm wooden compartments were built inside a greenhouse, and each compartment was filled with one type of soil from the Mississippi Delta. A total of 66 sensors with 18 data loggers were installed in the soil compartments to measure SVWC, SWP, and soil temperature. Soil samples were periodically collected from the compartments to determine SVWC using the gravimetric method. SVWC measured by the sensors was compared with that determined by the gravimetric method. The SVWC readings from the sensors had a linear regression relationship with the gravimetric SVWC (r(2) = 0.82). This relationship was used to calibrate the sensor readings. The SVWC and SWP sensors could detect the general trend of soil moisture changes. However, their measurements varied significantly among the sensors. To obtain accurate absolute soil moisture measurements, the sensors require individual and soil-specific calibration. The 5TM, MPS-2, and 200TS sensors performed well in soil temperature measurement tests. Individual temperature readings from these sensors were very close to the mean of all sensor readings.},

Three landsat satellite images 5, 7 and 8 (TM, ETM + and TIRS) were used for this purpose during three different dates (1998, 2008 and 2015). Soil moisture index (SMI) was produced based on calculated Land surface temperature (LST). Fifty five soil profiles have been dug to measure the depth of water tables of the study area. SMI Validation was carried out in 2015 using surface soil samples from the upper 5 cm in which actual moisture content was estimated. Digital change detection techniques for SMI were applied in order to monitor the change in the surface soil moisture along two time periods (1998-2008), (2008-2015). The results indicated that the spatio-temporal variations of soil moisture content are associated with soil texture, landuse/landcover, soil elevation and water table levels. Correlation between actual and retrieved soil moisture revealed a moderate correlation relationship with R-2 = 0.61. Furthermore, an increase of water table eastern the study area. Also the results illustrated the increasing of water table is a direct relation with soil moisture. In addition, an increase in the surface soil moisture (SSM) recognized in 22.06\% of the study area from 1998 to 2008 while, 40.55\% of the area showed an increased in the SSM from 2008 to 2015. This continuous increase in the SSM could be prone to the increasing agricultural expansion and water table levels which, led to conversion of sabkhas to water bodies and fish farms.

At first, the problem of predicting the dynamics of soil moisture content is studied on the base of the two-dimensional Richards' equation stated in terms of water head. The values of model's parameters are identified using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The ability to assess the reliability and accuracy of measurements was tested by studying deviations of the simulated values from Watermark sensor readings along with the variations within the growing season and between several seasons of identified values of model's parameters that can serve as indirect indicators of changes in soil structure.

The commonly used in-situ measurements are not feasible for mapping soil moisture at large-scale agricultural areas. Local direct root-zone soil moisture measurements cannot be reliably interpolated owing to the high spatial variability of soil structure and the vegetative content. Remote sensing methods are negatively affected by vegetation coverage and density regarding penetration and backscattering characteristics. In order to overcome these limitations, we propose a root-zone soil moisture estimation method utilizing a context-aware data clustering process, which can be applied prior to any statistical analysis, for empirical evaluation of data. In this aspect, the crops' phenological stages and soil-air temperature differences are defined as the two contexts for data clustering. Parameters such as canopy-air temperature difference, land surface temperature, and solar radiation with respect to plant energy and water processes are used for the analysis. The proposed model is utilized using piecewise linear regression of data obtained from 16 rainfed wheat parcels distributed across Turkey, under different climatic and topographic conditions. It is shown that the proposed context-aware data clustering process enables the nonlinear plant behavior to be analyzed linearly. The correlation value of the whole season increased from 21\% to a range between 78\% and 95\% for different clusters. The outliers became relevant and the parameters became significant after the proposed context-aware data clustering.},

Using the sub-irrigation method with the clay capsule technique is one of the most practical strategies for conserving water and reducing water consumption in arid and semi-arid areas. A clay capsule is one of the porous pipes in a sub-irrigation system that can release water near the root zone. This paper has attempted to improve the physical and hydraulic properties of clay capsules based on changing the percentage of organic matter in the raw material (G0). The raw material used in making clay capsules is obtained from the calcareous soil of Nasr Abad village of Gorgan, Iran. The ratio of rice bran husk flour to G0 as improving hydraulic properties was 1:2, 1:5, 1: 10, 1:15, and 1:20 (kg of rice bran to kg of air-dried soil). The produced clay capsules were named G2, G5, G10, G15, and G20 respectively. The water discharge and soil water distribution of clay capsules were measured at 10, 25, 50, 80, and 100 kPa of hydrostatic pressures with a discharge-pressure automation instrument. The findings revealed a positive and significant relationship between increasing organic matter levels and the discharge of porous clay capsules. Unlike in G2 and G5, the relationship between discharges and hydrostatic pressure is linear in G10, G15, and G20. Meanwhile, the soil wetting shape followed a spherical trend due to the slow seepage of clay capsules. However, the soil-wetting shapes in G10, G15, and G20 were spherical and trended to vertical ellipsoids in G5 and G2. This method is of high importance for irrigating plants, especially in arid and semi-arid regions, and can efficiently manage the water shortage problem.},

With particular reference to these measurements, the present paper describes the reliability analysis of the instruments, the operations related to the sensor calibration and the installation phases for the monitoring networks. Finally, some of the data coming from a node, belonging to one of the five monitoring networks, are reported.},

	abstract = {Abrupt onset and swift intensification characterize flash droughts. Global surface soil moisture (theta(RS)) from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite can facilitate a near-real-time assessment of emerging flash droughts at a 36-km footprint. However, a robust flash drought monitoring using theta(RS) must account for the (a) short observation record of SMAP, (b) nonlinear geophysical controls over theta(RS) dynamics, and (c) emergent meteorological drivers of flash droughts. We propose a new method for near-real-time characterization of droughts using Soil Moisture Stress (SMS, drought stress) and Relative Rate of Drydown (RRD, drought stress intensification rate)-developed using SMAP theta(RS) (March 2015-May 2021), footprint-scale seasonal soil water retention parameters and land-atmospheric coupling strength. SMS and RRD are nonlinearly combined to develop Flash Drought Stress Index (FDSI) to characterize emerging flash droughts (FDSI {\textgreater}= 0.71 for moderate to high RRD and SMS). Globally, FDSI shows a high correlation with concurrent meteorological anomalies. A mechanistic evaluation of flash droughts is presented for the Northern Great Plains, Central South Africa, and Eastern Australia using FDSI, SMS, and RRD. About 5.6\% of the earth's landmass experienced flash droughts of varying intensity and duration during 2015-2021 (FDSI {\textgreater}= 0.71 for {\textgreater}30 consecutive days), majorly in global drylands. FDSI shows high skill in forecasting vegetation health with a lead of 0-2 weeks, with exceptions in irrigated croplands and mixed forests. With readily available parameters, low data latency, and no dependence on model simulations, we provide a robust tool for global near-real-time flash drought monitoring using SMAP.},

Remote sensing has been used to estimate soil moisture in recent years with relatively low accuracies. In this paper, we aim to use remote sensing and wireless sensor networks to generate soil moisture indexes for a golf course. In the golf course, we identified three types of soil, and data was gathered for three months. Mathematical models were obtained using data from Sentinel-2, bands with a resolution of 10 and 20 m, and sensed soil moisture. Models with acceptable accuracy were obtained only for one out of three soil types, the natural soil in which natural vegetation is grown. Two multiple regression models are presented with an R-2 of 0.46 for bands at 10 m and 0.70 for bands at 20 m. Their mean absolute error was lower than 3\% in both cases. For the modified soils, the greens, and the golf course fairway, it was not feasible to obtain regression models due to the temporal uniformity of the grass and the range of variation of soil moisture. The developed moisture indexes were compared with existing options. The attained accuracies improve the current models. The verification indicates that the model generated with band 4 and band 12 is the one with better accuracy.},

	abstract = {Moisture content is an important index that affects the physical and mechanical properties of geotechnical materials. Rapid and accurate monitoring of soil moisture distribution is of great significance for guiding engineering practice. At present, the heat source method for moisture monitoring requires high stability of heat source intensity. To reduce the requirement of heating power, a point heat source (PHS) method for soil moisture monitoring was proposed. This method uses the correlation between the thermal conductivity of soil and the moisture content, and indirectly identifies the moisture content by monitoring the cooling law of the PHS in soil, which can eliminate the influence of heat source intensity. Based on this idea, a mobile PHS system for soil moisture monitoring composed of a sensing-heating system and a monitoring tube was designed, which can solve the spatial resolution problem of fiber Bragg grating measurement system. Firstly, the system was used to carry out calibration tests on two different graded soil specimens with uniform moisture content. According to the cooling law of the heat source in porous medium, the discriminant index eta of moisture content was defined, and then the relationship between the volumetric water content theta and eta was established. Then the tests were carried out in the soil specimens with non-uniform moisture content, and a calibration relation established by the calibration tests was used to invert theta. The results were compared with those measured by drying method, thus verifying the feasibility of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture sensing plays an important role in agriculture, especially in greenhouses or vertical farms. However, existing soil moisture sensing systems are either expensive and require batteries or suffer from low accuracy, preventing their real-world applications. This paper introduces SoilTAG, a battery-free, chipless tag-based high accuracy soil moisture sensing system. The key insight is that the tag's resonator can convert changes in soil moisture levels into changes in the tag's frequency response. However, two challenges need to be addressed before applying the system to the real world. First, how to design a resonator whose frequency response is sensitive to even small moisture changes, which is the basis for high-precision moisture sensing. To solve the challenge, we design a special structure (i.e., a defected ground structure) as the tag's resonator and optimize its key parameters to increase the frequency response sensitivity for different soil moisture levels. Second, how to design a robust soil moisture feature that is independent of the tag's location changes, since the frequency response varies by both the tag location and soil moisture. To deal with this challenge, we introduce a relative frequency response feature whose amplitude ratio is only related to soil moisture levels and independent of the tag location changes. Extensive experiments show that SoilTAG achieves 90th percentile moisture sensing error of 2\% , 3.64\% , and 8\% when the distance between transmitter and tag is 6 m, 10 m, and 13.9 m. Compared to current commodity sensors, SoilTAG saves the cost per sensor by more than 70\%.},

The mini-VNA Tiny is a compact vector network analyzer (VNA) with a USB connection to a smartphone or a tablet. There are 17 sets of data which have been collected from 15 different spots with varying soil moisture content. The actual moisture content on site was collected from TRIME-PICO 64/32 sensor. Upon collection, it was necessary to calibrate the resistance obtained from the mini-VNA between 1 MHz and 3 GHz. The data obtained from the study shows that the resonances of the antenna resistance shift to the left on the frequency spectrum as moisture content increases. A linear model relating the resistance and actual moisture content was developed from this study with coefficient of determination (R-2) value of 0.723 at 13 MHz. This value is much less than the anticipated R-2 = 0.95 for accurate measurement of soil moisture with monopole antenna at microwave frequency. This could be due to the 0.60 cm thickness of the monopole antenna which may not be suited for soil moisture measurement. Nonetheless, this study demonstrates the potential application of an inexpensive and portable mini-VNA Tiny and smartphone system for sensing applications.},

However, a fundamental limitation of this technology is that the water content can only be measured for approximately the top 5-cm layer of soil moisture, and only over low-to-moderate vegetation covered areas in order to meet the 0.04 m(3)/m(3) target accuracy, limiting its applicability. Consequently, a longer wavelength radiometer is being explored as a potential solution for measuring soil moisture in a deeper surface layer of soil and under denser vegetation. It is expected that P-band ( wavelength of 40 cm and frequency of 750 MHz) could potentially provide soil moisture information for the top similar to 10-cm layer of soil, being one-tenth to one-quarter of the wavelength. In addition, P-band is expected to have higher soil moisture retrieval accuracy due to its reduced sensitivity to vegetation water content and surface roughness. To demonstrate the potential of P-band passive microwave soil moisture remote sensing, a short-term airborne field experiment was conducted over a center pivot irrigated farm at Cressy in Tasmania, Australia, in January 2017. First results showing a comparison of airborne P-band brightness temperature observations against airborne L-band brightness temperature observations and ground soil moisture measurements are presented. The P-band brightness temperature was found to have a similar but stronger response to soil moisture compared to L-band.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a pivotal hydrological variable that links the terrestrial water, energy, and carbon cycles. In this article, a new soil moisture (SM) index (SMI), which aims to capture the temporal variability of SM, irrespective of cloud cover and solar illumination, was developed by using the L-band SM active passive (SMAP) radiometer observations. The SMI was proposed on the basis of two key foundations: 1) vegetation and roughness have similar effects on “depolarization” of microwave emission, while SM enhances polarization differences and 2) vegetation and roughness generally impose positive effects on surface emissivity, while SM and emissivity are negatively correlated. Based on the two physical principles, it is possible to decouple the effects of SM and those of vegetation and surface roughness in a 2-D space independent of vegetation type and roughness condition. The proposed SMI was then validated by in situ measurements from five dense SM networks covering different vegetation and climatic conditions and also compared with SMAP passive and European space agency climate change initiative (ESA CCI) SM products at a coarse resolution of 36 km, and SMAP-enhanced passive and Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) advanced microwave scanning radiometer (AMSR2) SM products at a medium resolution of 9 km. The results show that the new SMI is able to well reproduce the temporal dynamic of SM with a favorable averaged correlation coefficient value of 0.87 and 0.84 at 36 and 9 km, respectively, higher than that of SMAP passive (0.80), SMAP-enhanced passive (0.77), ESA CCI (0.69), and JAXA AMSR2 (0.53). After removing the systematic differences between satellite and site-specific SM data by using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) matching technique, the SMI can achieve an average root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.031 and 0.036 m(3)m(-3) at 36 and 9 km during the validation period, respectively, lower than that of the satellite SM products. In addition to surface temperature, the SMI does not need any further information from other sensors [e.g., the optical normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or leaf area index (LAI) data] to guarantee an all-weather monitoring. Therefore, it has great potential to estimate SM variability on a global scale.},

Firstly, the mathematical model of output voltages U under dual frequency (f1 and f2) excitation and dielectric permittivity Ka was established with several solution samples. Secondly, the empirical calibration equation of dielectric permittivity Ka and soil volume water content theta was determined with soil samples. Finally, the two-step calibration method was evaluated compared with empirical equations. Four different soil water content (25\%, 31\%, 36\%, and 41\%) samples were prepared with electrical conductivities in range of 0-1100 mu S/cm. The results showed that the mathematical model of theta - Ka has a better linearity which determination coefficient R-2 was 0.994, the maximum measurement error was 0.012 m(3).m(-3), and the maximum electrical conductivity variation was 0.029 when the soil water content was 41\%.

Proper estimation of moisture content not only allows for proper yields but can also contribute to ecologically appropriate use of fresh water, of which the world's resources are limited. It is important, for example, that the moisture content in the root area of plants is optimal for their growth, while over-watering can result in losses in the form of water, which seeps below the root layer and is lost. The novel, inexpensive electronic meter for measuring soil moisture is presented in the article. The meter, based on a capacitive method, uses an optimization algorithm to calculate soil electrical permeability and a simplified new formula between soil electrical permeability and volumetric moisture content. Moreover, by using two high-frequency signals for measurements, it is possible not only to estimate moisture content but also soil conductivity. Both readings obtained from the meter not only allow for rational management of crop optimization for economic reasons but are also important for environmental protection. In addition, the inexpensive meter, based on the principle of operation presented, can be made as an IoT module, which allows for its wide application.},

	abstract = {At present, Wireless Sensor Network technology are widely used in the fields of agricultural environment monitoring. Whether we use ground network or ground-air coordination, the position coordinates of unknown nodes are an important feature of sensor information collection. To achieve the goal of a wireless monitoring system for field soil irrigation and its node positioning, we proposed an RSSI (Received Signal Intensity Indication)-based agricultural environment irrigation monitoring system. The algorithm has three stages: RSSI ranging, error correction, and localization. In the RSSI ranging phase, we obtain inter-node measurement distance by wireless channel modeling. In the distance-weighted correction phase, considering the difference between the measured distance of the beacon nodes and the actual distance, we analyze and select the relative error coefficient for the beacon nodes to correct the measured distance between the unknown nodes and the beacon nodes within their communication range. In the positioning stage for the nodes to be located, we estimated the required node coordinates using a weighted centroid localization method. In addition, by analyzing the monitoring data, we know the changes in soil moisture in real-time, which provides new ideas for irrigation automation and the efficient utilization of water resources. When designing the algorithm, we thoroughly considered the influence of RSSI ranging inaccuracy and the quantity of beacon nodes on the localization precision. The test demonstrated that the method presented in this paper has higher localization precision and lower computation cost. In the application of the irrigation monitoring system in the agricultural environment, an RSSI-based ranging method is proposed for node localization.In the RSSI distance weighting correction stage, the difference between the measured distance of the beacon node and the actual distance is fully considered, and the relative error coefficient of the beacon node is analyzed and selected to obtain the accurate measurement distance.Under the case of harsh network environment and limited positioning cost, the system achieves better positioning effect.

A copper cladded epoxy material, coated with a thin film of polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) polymer, is an established procedure to fabricate the sensor [3], [4], which has been used here for soil moisture sensing. This paper describes the development of a rechargeable battery-operated hand-held meter for fieldwork by using this PMMA coated sensor along with a suitable signal conditioning circuit. The thermo-gravimetric method has been utilized to obtain the actual moisture content of soil [5] and calibrate it with respect to the voltage output of the meter. Moreover, with the moisture content, surrounding temperature and humidity are also useful atmospheric parameters used by weather stations [6]. For this, a DHT12 sensor has been integrated with this hand-held meter. IoT extension of measured data is implemented by a SIM900A GPRS/GSM modem to make the meter smart.},

	abstract = {Ground level enhancements (GLEs) are space weather events that pose a potential hazard to the aviation environment through single event effects in avionics and increased dose to passengers and crew. The existing ground level neutron monitoring network provides continuous and well-characterized measurements of the radiation environment. However, there are only a few dozen active stations worldwide, and there has not been a UK-based station for several decades. Much smaller neutron detectors are increasingly deployed throughout the world with the purpose of using secondary neutrons from cosmic rays to monitor local soil moisture conditions (COSMOS). Space weather signals from GLEs and Forbush decreases have been identified in COSMOS data. Monte Carlo simulations of atmospheric radiation propagation show that a single COSMOS detector is sufficient to detect the signal of a medium-strength (10\%-100\% increase above background) GLE at high statistical significance, including at fine temporal resolution. Use of fine temporal resolution would also provide a capability to detect Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes (via secondary neutrons) which are produced by certain lightning discharges and which can provide a hazard to aircraft, particularly in tropical regions. We also show how the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System-UK detector network could be used to provide warnings at the International Civil Aviation Organization “Moderate” and “Severe” dose rate thresholds at aviation altitudes, and how multiple-detector hubs situated at strategic UK locations could detect a small GLE at high statistical significance and infer crucial information on the nature of the primary spectrum.},

As a nationwide climate network, the network stations are distributed across vast complex terrains. Due to the expansive distribution of the network and the related variability in soil properties, obtaining site-specific calibrations for sensors is a significant and costly endeavor. Presented here are three commercial-grade electromagnetic sensors, with built-in thermistors to measure both soil water and soil temperature, including the SoilVUE10 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probe (hereafter called SP) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.), 50 MHz coaxial impedance dielectric sensor (model HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems, Inc.) (hereafter called HP), and the TDR-315L Probe (model TDR-315L, Acclima, Inc.) (hereafter called AP), which were evaluated in a relatively nonconductive loam soil in Oak Ridge, TN, from 2021 to 2022. The HP manufacturer-supplied calibration equation for loam soils was used in this study. While volumetric water content data from HP and AP were 82-99\% of respective gravimetric observations at 10 cm, data from SP were only 65-81\% of respective gravimetric observations in the top 20-cm soil horizon, where soil water showed relatively large spatial variability. The poor performance of the SP is likely due to poor contact between SP sensor electrodes and soil and the presence of soil voids caused by the installation method used, which itself may have caused soil disturbance.},

This article introduces the system composition of the end-cloud integrated multilayer soil moisture Internet of things sensor and then focuses on the design of key technologies, such as the moisture detection circuit, the time division multiplexing detection technology, and the deredundancy circuit in the analog-digital integrated design. The performance of the soil moisture detection circuit is directly related to the measurement accuracy of the sensor. A detection method is proposed using a high-frequency double-resonance circuit, which can detect small changes in moisture by changing the circuit detuning voltage. The maximum root mean square error of the calibration is less than 1.35\% for five typical soils from different places. Compared with that of an independent detection method, the output consistency of the time division multiplexing detection is significantly improved by using the time division multiplexing detection method, which has a root mean square error of only 0.12\%. In order to reduce errors caused by inconsistency in each burial, the gravimetric analysis is used in the sensitivity monitoring test, which shows that small changes in soil moisture can be detected by the circuit.},

This paper investigates a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-assisted intelligent monitoring method of soil temperature and moisture. The UAV platform is equipped with a high-precision infrared sensor to sample the discrete-time images of the target ground object. By combining the adaptive median filtering, the mean filtering and the Canny edge detection algorithms, we design a composite image preprocessing scheme to obtain the precise location information, and then extract the crop canopy temperature. Specifically, the soil moisture prediction model based on Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are established to achieve accurate prediction of farmland moisture. Experimental results show that (1) the proposed adaptive method is capable of improving the detection accuracy of the target canopy boundary and soil background; (2) by establishing the linear regression model between the real ground temperature and the UAV data, it is shown that the Canny algorithm can improve the extraction accuracy of the canopy temperature data from R{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}2 = 0.7673 to R{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}2 = 0.9355; (3) compared with the PCA method can greatly reduce the dimension of sample data, while the accuracy of the soil moisture content is almost unchanged.

	abstract = {Land surface model is a powerful tool for estimating continuous soil water content (SWC) and surface fluxes. However, simulation error tends to accumulate in the process of model simulation due to the inevitable uncertainties of forcing data and the intrinsic model errors. Data assimilation techniques consider the uncertainty of the model, update model states during the simulation period, and therefore improve the accuracy of SWC and surface fluxes estimation. In this study, an Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) technique was coupled to a Hydrologically Enhanced Land Process (HELP) model to update model states, including SWC and surface temperature (Ts). The remotely sensed latent heat flux (LE) estimated by Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) was used as the observation value in the data assimilation system to update the model states such as SWC and Ts, etc. The model was validated by the observation data in 2006 at the Weishan flux station, where the open-loop estimation without state updating was treated as the benchmark run. Results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) of SWC was reduced by 30\%similar to 50\% compared to the benchmark run. Meanwhile, the surface fluxes also had significant improvement to different extents, among which the RMSE of LE estimation from the wheat season and maize season reduced by 33\% and 44\%, respectively. The application of the data assimilation technique can substantially improve the estimation of surface fluxes and SWC states. It is suggested that the data assimilation system has great potential to be used in the application of land surface models in agriculture and water management.},

The perpendicular drought index (PDI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) are two drought indices that can reflect SWC based on remote sensing data.

Thus, it might be inappropriate to employ a single model for the entire growth cycle. In this study, the relationship between PDI/TVDI and SWC at soil depths of 0-20 cm, 0-30 cm and 0-40 cm was analysed. We found that the estimation accuracy of the PDI/TVDI model was markedly affected by soil depth and the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Two combination approaches (joint and combined models) based on PDI and TVDI indices were established. The root mean squared error (RMSE) of the joint/combined models were 1.49\%/1.48\% at 0-20 cm, 1.46\%/1.48\% at 0-30 cm and 1.86\%/1.90\% at 0-40 cm.

The study was carried out in commercial maize areas irrigated by central pivots in the western part of the state of Bahia, Brazil. The MOD09GQ product was used to generate input data for the training models and to understand the phenology variations in the crops. The prediction of the dependent variables was tested using six regression algorithms, and the best algorithm was selected based on five statistical metrics. Among the regression models tested, the three that best fit the ETa and SWC data were RF (random forest), cubist (cubist regression), and GBM (gradient boosting machine), with slight superiority of cubist for the ETa and RF for the SWC. The fitted models for ETa and SWC showed the potential of VIs in providing information for irrigated agriculture and reinforcing the ability of regression algorithms in modelling the SWC and ETa variables. The findings make it possible to monitor irrigation efficiently with only the red and near infrared wavelengths, a fact that is considered the main contribution of this research to the practical and scientific communities.},

To estimate the soil water holding capacity, the sole parameter required to run the SMA model, two approaches were compared: the direct estimation from European soil maps using pedotransfer functions or an indirect estimation by a machine learning approach, random forests, using as predictors altitude, temperature, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and land use. Results showed that the random forest model estimates are more robust, especially for estimating low soil moisture levels. Consequently, the proposed approach can provide an efficient way to simulate daily soil moisture and therefore monitor soil moisture droughts, in contexts where high-resolution soil maps are not available, as it relies on a set of covariates that can be reliably estimated from global databases.},

A microweighing lysimeter and oven-drying method were used as standard methods to compare the Insentek method. The root mean square error (RMSE, \% vol) and relative prediction deviation (RPD) between the Insentek and microlysimetric SWC values were 0.89-1.04\% vol and 5.6-6.8, respectively, under laboratory condition. The RPD value is larger than the threshold value of 4.0, indicating the accuracy of the Insentek sensors is reliable under laboratory condition.

The tiny gap between the Insentek sensor and soil may accelerate water infiltration along the probe 0-3 d after irrigation while increase air filling 5-7 d after irrigation, causing greater RMSE and lower RPD values. The dissatisfied performance in field condition may also be associated with the obvious drawbacks of oven-drying method, such as disturbance in soil sampling.

Passive microwave remote sensing has proven capable of capturing changes in SM. However, the coarse spatial resolution (approximately 25-40 km) may greatly limit many regional hydrological and agricultural applications. In this study, we present a SM downscaling method based on the visible and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) remote sensing data toward improved spatial resolution of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM. In the proposed method, the Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), horizontally polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh), vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBv) and SWIR reflectance collected in Inner Mongolia from April to September 2018 and April to September 2019 are used as input data and combined with topographic information to downscale the SMAP SM L3 product from the original 36 km to 1 km. Random forest (RF) was used to link the input data and SMAP SM. Finally, 30 in situ station SM measurements distributed in Inner Mongolia and precipitation data were used to verify the downscaled SM. The results show that the correlation range of the downscaled SM and the in situ SM is 0.246 to 0.739, with an average of 0.535. The root mean square error (RMSE) range is 0.02 to 0.152 m(3)/m(3), and the mean RMSE is 0.059 m(3)/m(3). The ubRMSE has a range of 0.02 to 0.06 m(3)/m(3), and the mean performance is 0.04 m(3)/m(3). The bias ranges from - 0.145 to 0.087 m(3)/m(3), and the mean bias is 0.008 m(3)/m(3). The downscaled SMAP SM can capture the spatial heterogeneity of the SMAP SM and the dynamic changes in measured soil moisture. The downscaled SMAP SM also has a high spatial correspondence with the original SMAP SM, providing more detailed soil water information than the original 36 km resolution.},

	abstract = {Improving the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) is a challenging and popular topic. Quantifying the uncertainty in the SM inversion process and enhancing the confidence of SM retrieval are promising ways to address this challenge but have received little attention. We present a Bayesian probabilistic inversion algorithm that can simultaneously retrieve SM, surface roughness, and vegetation optical depth and quantify the uncertainty in the inversion. The proposed algorithm is evaluated using airborne polarimetric L-band multibeam radiometer (PLMR) observations. We use three combinations, 3-angular observations at V-polarization (3CV), 3-angular observations at H-polarization (3CH), and 6-channel observations (6CA), to identify the optimal configuration for SM retrieval by taking advantage of PLMR's dual-polarization and multiple angles. Uncertainties are quantified by introducing multiple uncertainty quantification metrics into Bayesian posterior distributions of SM retrievals. The estimates are validated against multiscale ground-based measurements, including manual measurements and wireless sensor network (WSN) measurements, and the spatial representativeness of the ground-based reference regarding the validation of pixel-scale SM retrievals is discussed. The 6CA attempt yields the best SM estimates (correlation coefficient (R) {\textgreater}= 0.864 , root mean square error (RMSE) {\textless}= 0.04 m(3)/m(3), and unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE) {\textless}= 0.035 m(3)/m(3)), while the 3CH attempt yields the lowest uncertainty. In addition, dense manual measurements are more representative than sparsely distributed WSN measurements. Overall, combining dual-polarized observations yields the best SM estimates but introduces additional uncertainty. This study highlights uncertainties quantification in SM inversion and thus provides confidence in SM inversion, facilitating improved SM retrieval algorithms.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture content (MC) and density of pavement materials exert a great influence on pavement performance. Cyclic traffic loading with increasing MC in materials can accelerate changes in density significantly. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a non-destructive method for measuring MC and density of soil. In this study, TDR measurements were taken in the laboratory for a typical road material at two different conditions; at constant MC with different density and at constant dry density with different MC. Based on TDR measurements, a theoretical formulation between voltage drop occurring for the passage of an electromagnetic wave through the soil and the electrical conductivity (EC) is developed. This relationship is further correlated to develop density function providing the opportunity to obtain MC information. For the validation of the calibration functions, sensors are installed in roads to obtain field data. Laboratory results point out that the calibration models are independent of moisture and density, and the field instrumentation shows the satisfactory accuracy of the method. The newly established calibration models allow for observing the routine performance providing a better understanding of the material behaviour for example rutting of roads.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate the duration and severity of drought events from 1988 to 2018 in hydrographic basins of the state of Pernambuco, Brazil, using two drought indexes: Standardized Soil Moisture Index and Soil Moisture Condition Index, calculated based on data of the Soil Moisture Project of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative. The duration of the droughts was determined considering the months between their beginning and end, and their severity was based on the area formed in the graph between the curve of the index and the x-axis. The soil moisture database showed to be a promising tool for the analysis and monitoring of drought events in the Northeast region of Brazil, mainly for analysis and monitoring of drought events. The indexes allowed the evaluation of the drought phenomenon over the 30-year period, showing increases from 2012, which were more pronounced in the Semiarid region. The hydrographic basins responded differently to a same event, depending on the climate characteristics of the region in which they are located. Consecutive years with rainfall below the historical mean increased the magnitude of the droughts, as found for the 2012-2017 period, in which the indexes presented delays to return to more favorable values, showing the effect that one drought year has on the following year.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an important parameter in water cycle research. Rapid and accurate monitoring of SM is critical for hydrological and agricultural applications, such as flood detection and drought characterization. The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) uses L-band microwave signals as carriers, which are particularly sensitive to SM and suitable for monitoring it. In recent years, with the development of Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) technology and data analysis methods, many studies have been conducted on GNSS-R SM monitoring, which has further enriched the research content. However, current GNSS-R SM inversion methods mainly rely on auxiliary data to reduce the impact of non-target parameters on the accuracy of inversion results, which limits the practical application and widespread promotion of GNSS-R SM monitoring. In order to promote further development in GNSS-R SM inversion research, this paper aims to comprehensively review the current status and principles of GNSS-R SM inversion methods. It also aims to identify the problems and future research directions of existing research, providing a reference for researchers. Firstly, it introduces the characteristics, usage scenarios, and research status of different GNSS-R SM observation platforms. Then, it explains the mechanisms and modeling methods of various GNSS-R SM inversion research methods. Finally, it highlights the shortcomings of existing research and proposes future research directions, including the introduction of transfer learning (TL), construction of small models based on spatiotemporal analysis and spatial feature fusion, and further promoting downscaling research.},

In this study, we developed a new nonlinear Erf-BP neural network method to establish a soil-moisture-content-estimation model with integrated multiple-resource remote-sensing data from high-resolution, hyperspectral and microwave sensors. Next, we compared the result with the single-resource remote-sensing data for SMC (soil-moisture content) estimation models by using the linear-fitting method. The results showed that the soil-moisture estimation model offers better accuracy by using multiple-resource remote-sensing data. Furthermore, the SMC predicted the results by using the new Erf-BP neural network with multiple-resource remote-sensing data and a good overall correlation coefficient of 0.6838. Compared with the linear model's estimation results, the accuracy of the SMC estimation using the Erf-BP method was increased, and the RMSE decreased from 0.017 g/g to 0.0146 g/g, a decrease of 16.44\%. These results also indicate that the improved algorithm of the Erf-BP artificial neural network has better fitting results and precision.

It is greatly influenced by unpredictable and intermittent precipitation, varying evapotranspiration rates, heterogeneous soils, land cover, topography, and is extremely changeable in both space and time. The aim of this study is to retrieve surface and rootzone soil moisture in fallow land at a field scale using Sentinel-1A SAR data. The study explores the potential of obtaining surface soil moisture over fallow land at two different soil types from C-band SAR data. The study area consists of two plots having different soil types. The study area was divided into 80 grids, each measuring 10 x 10 m, to collect soil samples which are synchronized with Sentinel-1A passes. The soil moisture which are retrieved from plot 1 were used to develop the model. The developed model was validated in plot 2. In order to study the impact of soil moisture and dielectric constant on backscattering coefficients, a multiple regression analysis was used to create a semi-empirical model. Rootzone soil moisture retrieval model was developed by considering the backscattered coefficient, volumetric surface soil moisture as an independent variable and volumetric rootzone soil moisture as dependent variable. The predicted surface soil moisture using the regression model were identical to in-situ observed surface soil moisture, with R2 of 0.77, RMSE of 1.31 m3/m3, and NSE of 0.75. The estimated rootzone soil moisture matches the in-situ observed rootzone soil moisture identically with R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 1.23 m3/m3, NSE = 0.73.

	abstract = {Vadose zone soil moisture is often considered a pivotal intermediary water reservoir between surface and groundwater in semi-arid regions. Understanding its dynamics in response to changes in meteorologic forcing patterns is essential to enhance the climate resiliency of our ecological and agricultural system. However, the inability to observe high-resolution vadose zone soil moisture dynamics over large spatiotemporal scales hinders quantitative characterization. Here, utilizing pre-existing fiber-optic cables as seismic sensors, we demonstrate a fiber-optic seismic sensing principle to robustly capture vadose zone soil moisture dynamics. Our observations in Ridgecrest, California reveal sub-seasonal precipitation replenishments and a prolonged drought in the vadose zone, consistent with a zero-dimensional hydrological model. Our results suggest a significant water loss of 0.25 m/year through evapotranspiration at our field side, validated by nearby eddy-covariance based measurements. Yet, detailed discrepancies between our observations and modeling highlight the necessity for complementary in-situ validations. Given the escalated regional drought risk under climate change, our findings underscore the promise of fiber-optic seismic sensing to facilitate water resource management in semi-arid regions. A fiber-optic seismic sensing principle provides a spatiotemporal view of vadose zone soil moisture dynamics, offering a scalable solution for enhanced long-term, large-scale water resource management in face of climate variability.},

The impact of soil cracks on the measurements was investigated through a series of numerical simulations, and a modified function was proposed to eliminate measurement errors. The results show that the Cai model can accurately describe the relationship between the thermal conductivity and moisture content, and is thus utilized as the calibration model. Under the heating strategy, the influence range of the sensor is roughly 4 cm in the radial direction. Cracks within that range hinder heat transmission, leading to underestimation of moisture contents. The RMSE of the measurements after modification is reduced to 0.030 m(3).m(-3), which verifies that AH-FBG sensing technology can be extended to the reliable measurement of expansive soil moisture.},

The experiment was made in 2019 and 2020 in the Centre of Tunisia (Kairouan city, locality of Elhouereb), which is one of the largest irrigation area of Tunisia. WP was computed regarding the actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) which was determined following the water balance method as: ETa=R+I-Delta S, where Delta S is the amount of water stored in the soil (0-60 cm) and (R) and (I) are the amounts of the seasonal rainfall and the irrigation volume, respectively. The annual ETa reached 293 mm for the rainfed orchard, 823 mm for the semi-intensive irrigated plantation and 819 mm for the intensive fertigated orchard. The WP defined as being the ratio of Yield (kg olives/tree)/ETa ranged between 0.29 kg/m(3) (rainfed) and 0.77 kg/m(3) (fertigated) depending on the cultivation system. Soil moisture was found to be correlated to the average backscatter coefficient (r =-0.34 for the rainfed and 0.91 for the irrigated orchards) which was determined from the radar images which were treated by using different applications (SNAP, ODK, QGIS.), This result shows the performance of the remote sensing tools for such application. To conclude: WP is at least two times higher in the irrigated orchards than in the rainfed grove; this indicates a great potential of WP improvement if the horticultural practices are well applied in the orchad (pruning, irrigation); so that, the WP can be used as a decision-making-tool for farmers and makers in the future.},

	abstract = {For the last couple of decades, the idea of soil water measurement has gained widespread importance due to the spiraling crisis of global water resources. While several methods are being commonly used for soil water measurement, most of them do not satisfy all the essential requirements for water monitoring under field conditions including rapid on-site measurement and cost-effectiveness. This study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of a novel field-portable acoustic sensing device on soil moisture measurements. The conventional Brutsaert's model was followed involving the continuous wave zero-crossing method to measure the acoustic velocity and considering the phase shift due to the amplifier and ambient temperature. The gravimetric moisture content (GMC) was calibrated using the acoustic velocity for 70 samples representing seven textural classes and variable soil organic carbon (OC). Results indicated the monotonous reduction of the acoustic velocities of p-wave with increasing GMC. In general, soils with higher clay content reflected higher acoustic velocities. However, sandy soils with high OC content were less prone to compaction and produced comparatively higher acoustic velocities than soils with higher clay content. A linear mixed effect (LME) model indicated that one unit increase in the acoustic velocity resulted in a 0.086\% decrease in GMC. Moreover, LME parameters-based K-means clustering further highlighted the influence of soil texture for controlling the acoustic velocity. The use of LME justified the use of GMC as the target instead of the degree of saturation. Linear and quadratic models fitted for individual LME-based clusters produced R-2 values ranging from 0.80 to 0.88 and 0.82-0.88, respectively. Moreover, combined linear (R-2 = 0.61; RMSE = 52.12 m/s) and quadratic (R-2 = 0.64; RMSE = 50.48 m/s) models incorporating all 70 samples via bootstrapping produced comparable accuracies for GMC prediction, but yielded inferior results than the individual cluster-based models. In conclusion, the acoustic sensing device showed its potential for soil water content monitoring, leading to efficient irrigation planning. More research is warranted for texture-wise calibration development incorporating a wide assortment of soil types and on-site evaluation.},

The past few decades have seen extensive research being carried out in the area of development and evaluation of different technologies available to estimate/measure soil moisture to aid in various applications and to facilitate the use of drip irrigation for users and farmers. In this technology, plant moisture and temperature are accurately monitored and controlled in real time over roots in the form of droplets, by developing smart monitoring system to save water and avoid water waste using drip irrigation technology. Water is delivered to the roots drop by drop, which saves water as well as prevents plants from being flooded and decaying due to excess water released by irrigation methods such as flood irrigation, border irrigation, furrow irrigation, and control basin irrigation. Drip irrigation with an embedded intelligent monitoring system is one of the most valuable techniques used to save water and farmers' time and energy. In this paper, we design an embedded monitoring system based in the integrated 65 nm CMOS technology in agricultural practices which would facilitate agriculture and enable farmers to monitor crops.

To solve the problem of unreasonable drought/wetness classifications based on the soil moisture anomaly percentage index (SMAPI), an improved soil moisture anomaly percentage index (ISMAPI) was developed by introducing the Box-Cox transformation. The drought/wetness frequency generated by ISMAPI demonstrated preferable spatial comparability in comparison with those from SMAPI. The lag time of ISMAPI relative to the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index was closely related to soil depth, and was characterized by a fast response in shallow soil layers and a relatively slow response in deep soil layers. SM in shallow soil layers provided a measure for monitoring short-term droughts, whereas SM in deep soil layers provided a better measure for long-term persistent drought events. Furthermore, the occurrence and mitigation time of drought events identified by SM in deep soil layers usually lagged behind that identified by SM in shallow soil layers. Compared with deep SM, SM in shallow soil layers responded faster to meteorological anomalies, thereby resulting in shorter periods of SM persistence in shallow soil layers than in deep soil layers. This can explain the differences of SM at different depths in drought monitoring. (c) 2021 Hohai University. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

A handheld TDR meter was used in these experiments. Soil moisture data were correlated with the vehicle mobility index and a simple model for this correlation was derived. Using grassy airfield research, soil moisture data were related to meteorological impacts (precipitation, sunlight, etc.). Generally, it was concluded that the TDR meter, in its handheld version, was a useful tool in the performed research, but a field sensor that operates autonomically would be an optimal solution for the subject applications.},

	abstract = {Successful precision agriculture decision making requires characterizing soil heterogeneity at high spatiotemporal resolution in real-time in order to optimize input (such as water and nutrient) amounts and location. In order to achieve this goal, a printed soil moisture sensor fabricated from biodegradable materials is demonstrated. These devices are intended to function during the growing season and then harmlessly degrade afterward, enabling high-density deployment, eliminating the need for sensor retrieval, and enabling the use of simple device structures and low-cost materials and fabrication techniques. A capacitive structure is used with a water-soluble zinc electrode printed onto a biodegradable substrate. Rapidly degrading substrate and electrode are encapsulated in a slowly degrading wax blend that protects the device, reduces drift, and controls degradation time. A linear capacitance response is observed for soil samples with a volumetric water content from 0 to 72\%. Accelerated degradation testing demonstrates that the sensor responds predictably and stably until the encapsulation is breached, at which point the sensor fails rapidly, providing a clear distinction between the functional and nonfunctional lifetimes of the sensor. These results demonstrate the potential of biodegradable sensors to allow maintenance-free, affordable, and real-time soil moisture measurement at high spatial density for precision irrigation control.},

	abstract = {A new type of soil moisture sensor using spatial frequency domain transmissometry (SFDT) was evaluated. This sensor transmits and receives ultrawideband (1 to 6 GHz) radio waves between two separated antennas and measures the propagation delay time in the soil related to the dielectric constant. This method is expected to be less affected by air gaps between the probes and the soil, as well as being less affected by soil electrical conductivity (EC), than typical commercial sensors. The relationship between output and volumetric water content (theta), and the effects of air gaps and EC were evaluated through experiments using sand samples and the prototype SFDT sensor. The output of the SFDT sensor increased linearly with theta and was not affected by even a high salt concentration for irrigation water, such that the EC of the pore water was 9.2 dS.m(-1). The SFDT sensor was almost unaffected by polyethylene tapes wrapped around the sensor to simulate air gaps, whereas a commercially available capacitance sensor significantly underestimated theta. Theoretical models of the SFDT sensor were also developed for the calibration equation and the air gaps. The calculation results agreed well with the experimental results, indicating that analytical approaches are possible for the evaluation of the SFDT sensor.},

A randomized complete block design, replicated three times, was used with four treatments, which included continuous unfertilized maize, natural fallow-maize, pigeonpea + grass-pigeonpea-maize, and two-year pigeonpea fallow-maize. Soil water mark sensors were installed 0.2; 0.5; and 1.2 m on each plot to monitor soil water tension (kPa). Soil samples were analyzed using pressure plates to determine water retention curves which were used to convert soil water tension to volumetric water content. Maize rotated with two-year pigeonpea fallows had higher dry matter yield (11,661 kg ha(-1)) and WUE (20.78 kg mm(-1)) than continuous maize (5314 kg ha(-1) and 9.48 kg mm(-1)). In this era of water scarcity and drought incidences caused by climate change, maize rotated with pigeonpea fallows is recommended among smallholder farmers in RSA because of its higher WUE, hence food security will be guaranteed.},

Accurate and real-time soil data has become one of the most valuable resources among farmers. Real-time soil sensor data can be exploited in manners that increase farm production and profit, maintain and increase product quality, promote food security, and ensure environmental protection. Researchers have already attempted to develop real-time in situ soil nutrient sensors based on optical and electrochemical techniques. Of these sensor systems, only a few of them are commercially available for monitoring. In this review, we present both available sensors and sensors under research in agriculture. Then briefly discuss both advantages and challenges to overcome in order to produce systems that deliver real-time quality soil information. Optical and electrochemical sensors are becoming less expensive to manufacture and can provide results that are comparable to laboratory soil analysis. Based on the literature presented here, there still exists a need to understand the effects of soil heterogeneity on the analytical performance of both electrochemical and optical systems when used in situ. By doing so, these sensors can be fully adopted as suitable commercial platforms. Overall, these sensors harness the potential to revolutionize decision management systems in agriculture as internet of things (IoT) soil nutrient sensors. (C) 2020 The Author(s).

However, for maize and pepper with more irrigation times, the SWC estimation results, based on the CWSI were poor, indicating that the method was more sensitive to soil drought and suitable for the crop SWC estimation with less irrigation and drought tolerance.

	abstract = {Determination of an appropriate location for monitoring soil water content (SWC) is a key factor in efficient use of water in precision agriculture, however, the main challenge is the dynamic movement of water and root development in the soil profile. The objective of this study was investigating how SWC distribution in a loam soil profile at two growth stages of maize may impact the suitable location for SWC monitoring in a drip-tape irrigation system. A new concept, Average Moisture Representative Surface (AMRS) was proposed to determine the surface of the soil profile, which represent the average soil moisture of the wetted volume. SWC samples were taken during two irrigation intervals (48-52 days after planting (DAP) and 68-73 DAP) and root growth pattern was studied through root length density (RLD) at 50 and 100 DAP. The results revealed that a non-uniform wetting pattern after irrigation limits the appropriate locations for SWC monitoring to point measurements and with time, SWC depletion resulted in enlarging AMRS. At the end of growing season, an increase of root growth around the drippers increased the variation of root water uptake in different soil layers, and thus optimal place for soil sensors was limited to the upper layers, where the maximum root water uptake occurred. Overall, it is recommended to install soil sensors, such as tensiometers and TDRs at a horizontal distance of 5-20 cm from the crop and a depth of 10-20 cm from the soil surface while drip-tape is aligned close to the maize row.

The sampling volume of the probe was determined by simulating the electric potential distribution around the probe rods by using the HYDRUS-2D software package and verified by comparison with the measured dielectric constant in saturated sand. The performance of the probe was evaluated by comparing its dielectric measurements in wet sand over a wide range of water content during evaporative drying with that measured by CS640 probes. Additionally, the dependency of visible light reflection on the water content of the sand was evaluated. The results revealed that the average effective thickness of the probe's sampling volume was 5-6 cm on both sides of the plane of the probe rods. The probe accurately measured the soil water content over a 0.88 m2 spatial area. The visible light reflectance of the variably saturated sand surface and the corresponding water content of the sand follow a soil water retention function-type relationship. The usage of the multirod TDR measurement system at a larger spatial scale carries practical implications, especially in increasing the accuracy of remote sensing data.

This study evaluated three vegetation calibration methods with the correction of vegetation distribution developed for a CRNP on the Loess Plateau of China. Three plots with different vegetation distributions were selected and equipped with CRNPs and SWC sensors, and their biomass as well as distribution were measured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a RedEdge multispectral camera. We found that the parameter N-0, which is neutron flux in dry soil, was best represented by the biomass at average growth conditions of the monitoring period, yielding the lowest RMSE (0.068). The Veg-N-0 vegetation calibration method reduced the RMSE the most between the CRNP SWC and the Kriging-weighted SWC, and the correction of the spatial distribution of the vegetation further reduced the RMSE. The cooperation between the CRNP and the UAV could obtain the regional averaged SWC accurately. This study makes up for the lack of vegetation calibration for the CRNP on the Loess Plateau, which should help develop sustainable vegetation management and ecohydrological management strategies on the Loess Plateau, so as to protect water security in the region.},

As the demand for clean water increases, so does the need to implement more efficient strategies for water management in irrigated agriculture. While the benefits of precision irrigation in high-value crops, such as cannabis, tomatoes, and potatoes, are fully recognized, there is still need to investigate and implement cheap and efficient irrigation strategies for widespread low-value crops such as maize. In this study, the soil moisture dynamics in a sprinkler-irrigated maize field in Veneto (Northeastern Italy) was monitored using six time domain reflectometry (TDR) probes for the entire growing season. The TDR sensors were positioned at different depths into two separate sites: an Uninformed Site irrigated based on the farmer's experience and an Informed Site in which a water balance irrigation strategy was applied based on soil moisture measurements. A parsimonious hydrological model was then implemented and calibrated to quantify the different water balance terms (precipitation, evapotranspiration, lateral fluxes, and deep percolation). The comparison between the water budget terms in the two sites highlights that soil moisture monitoring during agriculture activities leads to substantial savings in terms of irrigation water volumes requirements and cost, without compromising the productivity of the crop field. A simplified upscaling of the results at the regional scale, assuming average conditions as in this study site and growing season, reveals that potentially significant economic savings, compared to the total profits linked to maize crops, could be possible.},

In bare and low-vegetation-covered soils, the apparent thermal inertia (ATI) method, which adopts thermal infrared data from UAV-based remote sensing, has been widely used for soil moisture estimation at the field scale. However, the ATI method may not perform well under inconsistent weather conditions due to inconsistency of the intensity of the soil surface energy input. In this study, an improvement of the ATI method (ATI-R), considering the variation in soil surface energy input, was developed by the incorporation of solar radiation measurements. The performances of the two methods were compared using field experiment data during multiple heating processes under various weather conditions. It showed that on consistently sunny days, both ATI-R and ATI methods obtained good correlations with the volumetric water contents (VWC) (R-ATI-R(2) = 0.775, RMSEATI-R = 0.023 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.778, RMSEATI = 0.018 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)) on cloudy or a combination of sunny and cloudy days as long as there were significant soil-heating processes despite the different energy input intensities; the ATI-R method could perform better than the ATI method (cloudy: R-ATI-R(2) = 0.565, RMSEATI-R = 0.024 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.156, RMSEATI = 0.033 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3); combined: R-ATI-R(2) = 0.673, RMSEATI-R = 0.028 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.310, RMSEATI = 0.032 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)); and on overcast days, both the ATI-R and ATI methods could not perform satisfactorily (R-ATI-R(2) = 0.027, RMSEATI-R = 0.024 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3) and R-ATI(2) = 0.027, RMSEATI = 0.031 cm(3)\& BULL;cm(-3)).

	abstract = {Prognostic prediction of soil moisture is a critical step in various fields such as geotechnical engineering, agriculture, geology, hydrology, and climatology. For example, in agricultural applications, soil moisture prediction is needed one-day and one-week ahead of time to optimize crop planting quality and set irrigation schedule, respectively. In soil and environmental management applications, soil moisture prediction is usually needed one-month ahead of time. Therefore, a capability to accurately forecast soil moisture is of paramount importance. For this purpose, deep learning methods, especially the long short-term memory network (LSTM) method, have been used extensively. It is shown that such models can successfully forecast the soil moisture for a short time frame in future, but their accuracy sharply decreases for long time frames. To resolve this issue, in this study, we present a multihead LSTM model that learns a number of hypotheses and aggregates them for prognostic prediction tasks. The multihead LSTM model is comprised of four LSTM models that digest time series data of soil moisture aggregated at different scales as inputs. The outputs of these models, i.e., predicted soil moisture at a certain time in future, are then combined using a weighted averaging method to obtain the final prediction values. Different statistical measures, such as the root mean square error (RMSE), mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R-squared are employed to assess the performance of the multihead LSTM model predictions against the ground truth. The results show that the proposed multihead LSTM method is effective to forecast the soil moisture up to one-month in future with a R-squared value of 95.04\%.},

Our goal was to investigate the impact of introducing Eucalyptus trees into a pasture on the soil water content throughout the soil profile. The study was conducted in a 6-year-old agroforestry system where two species of Eucalyptus were introduced into a palisade grass pasture. Soil moisture was sampled at 0.0 (planting row), 2.0, 4.0, and 6.0 m (midpoint between tree rows) from the Eucalyptus tree rows. A monoculture palisade grass pasture was used as a control. The soil water content down to a depth of 50 cm was lowest in the tree row and increased with distance from the trees. In the Eucalyptus row, the soil water content in the 0-50 cm layer was lower than in the monoculture pasture. Agroforestry systems decreased the water content in the superficial layers of the soil in the rainy months; in the dry season, the soil water contents in all layers were similar between the Eucalyptus inter-rows. In most seasons, the agroforest systems reduced the forage production close to the Eucalyptus tree rows, up to 2 m from the trees, likely due to the soil water content decrease. Overall, this study showed that in tropical regions with sandy soils, the grass and trees' competition must be considered when establishing integrated agroforestry systems in order to maximize the advantages and benefits of the diversified agroecosystem.},

	doi = {10.3390/rs11101200},
	abstract = {Mapping drought from space using, e.g., surface soil moisture (SSM), has become viable in the last decade. However, state of the art SSM retrieval products suffer from very poor coverage over northern latitudes. In this study, we propose an innovative drought indicator with a wider spatial and temporal coverage than that obtained from satellite SSM retrievals. We evaluate passive microwave brightness temperature observations from the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite as a surrogate drought metric, and introduce a Standardized Brightness Temperature Index (STBI). We compute the STBI by fitting a Gaussian distribution using monthly brightness temperature data from SMOS; the normal assumption is tested using the Shapior-Wilk test. Our results indicate that the assumption of normally distributed brightness temperature data is valid at the 0.05 significance level. The STBI is validated against drought indices from a land surface data assimilation system (LDAS-Monde), two satellite derived SSM indices, one from SMOS and one from the ESA CCI soil moisture project and a standardized precipitation index based on in situ data from the European Climate Assessment \& Dataset (ECA\&D) project. When comparing the temporal dynamics of the STBI to the LDAS-Monde drought index we find that it has equal correlation skill to that of the ESA CCI soil moisture product (0.71). However, in addition the STBI provides improved spatial coverage because no masking has been applied over regions with dense boreal forest. Finally, we evaluate the STBI in a case study of the 2018 Nordic drought. The STBI is found to provide improved spatial and temporal coverage when compared to the drought index created from satellite derived SSM over the Nordic region. Our results indicate that when compared to drought indices from precipitation data and a land data assimilation system, the STBI is qualitatively able to capture the 2018 drought onset, severity and spatial extent. We did see that the STBI was unable to detect the 2018 drought recovery for some areas in the Nordic countries. This false drought detection is likely linked to the recovery of vegetation after the drought, which causes an increase in the passive microwave brightness temperature, hence the STBI shows a dry anomaly instead of normal conditions, as seen for the other drought indices. We argue that the STBI could provide additional information for drought monitoring in regions where the SSM retrieval problem is not well defined. However, it then needs to be accompanied by a vegetation index to account for the recovery of the vegetation which could cause false drought detection.},

S-SMMI was used to analyze the scale effect of soil moisture monitoring at different scales. The results show that the difference between the soil moisture is only 0.0016 during the conversion process of 2 m-30 m.},

In this study, the performance of a commercially available multi-sensor capacitance probe was evaluated under irrigated field conditions across western Oklahoma. The effects of clay content and salinity on sensor performance were investigated too. In addition, the field capacity (FC) of soil cores collected at study sites was determined in the laboratory. These laboratory FC values were used to assess the performance of two sensor-based approaches for estimating FC: the days to reach laboratory FC after major watering events and the percentile of collected sensor readings that represented laboratory FC. The results showed that among the six calibrations provided by the manufacturer, the default and silty clay loam calibrations produced the largest and smallest soil water content errors, respectively. Errors generally increased with clay and salinity, except for the heavy clay calibration, which showed improved performance with increasing clay content. The default and sand calibrations were more sensitive to increases in clay and salinity compared to other calibrations. In the case of sensor-based FC, on average, one to three days were required to reach laboratory FC, with a large range of one to nine days. The percentiles representing laboratory FC had an average of 56\% and a range of 3\%-97\%. Overall, the sensor-based approaches produced inconsistent and highly variable estimates of FC.},

We found that hierarchical MoS2 marigold flower-like nanostructures offer the highest sensitivity of about 2000 \%, when gravimetric water content (GWC) is varied from 1 \% to 20 \% GWC, which is one of the highest reported SMS. The sensors exhibit hysteresis of about +/- 4 \% and response times of about 500 s. They were highly selective to moisture compared to the other salts like Na, K, Cd, and Cu present in the soil.

	abstract = {Continuous and accurate sensing of water content in soil is an essential and useful measure in the agriculture industry. Traditional sensors developed to perform this task suffer from limited lifetime and also need to be calibrated regularly. Further, maintenance, support, and deployment of these sensors in remote environments provide additional challenges to the use of conventional soil moisture sensors. In this paper, a metamaterial perfect absorber (MPA) based soil moisture sensor is introduced. The ability of MPAs to absorb electromagnetic signals with near 100\% efficiency facilitates the design of highly accurate and low- profile radio frequency passive sensors. MPA based sensor can be fabricated from highly durable materials and can therefore be made more resilient than traditional sensors. High resolution sensing is achieved through the creation of physical channels in the substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) cavity. The proposed sensor does not require connection for both electromagnetic signals or for adding a testing sample. Importantly, an external power supply is not needed, making the MPA based sensor the perfect solution for remote and passive sensing in modern agriculture. The proposed MPA based sensor has three absorption bands due to the various resonance modes of the SIW cavity. By changing the soil moisture level, the absorption peak shifts by 10 MHz, 23.3 MHz, and 60 MHz, which is correlated with the water content percentage at the first, second and third absorption bands, respectively. Finally, a 6 x 6 cell array with a total size of 312mm x 312mm has been fabricated and tested. A strong correlation between measurement and simulation results validates the design procedure.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an integral quantity parameter in hydrology and agriculture practices. Satellite remote sensing has been widely applied to estimate surface soil moisture. However, it is still a challenge to retrieve surface soil moisture content (SMC) data in the heterogeneous catchment at high spatial resolution. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the retrieval of SMC from remote sensing data, which is important in the planning and efficient use of land resources. Many methods based on satellite-derived vegetation indices have already been developed to estimate SMC in various climatic and geographic conditions. Soil moisture retrievals were performed using statistical and machine learning methods as well as physical modeling techniques. In this study, an important experiment of soil moisture retrieval for investigating the capability of the machine learning methods was conducted in the early spring season in a semi-arid region of Iran. We applied random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), artificial neural network (ANN), and elastic net regression (EN) algorithms to soil moisture retrieval by optical and thermal sensors of Landsat 8 and knowledge of land-use types on previously untested conditions in a semi-arid region of Iran. The statistical comparisons show that RF method provided the highest Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency value (0.73) for soil moisture retrieval covered by the different land-use types. Combinations of surface reflectance and auxiliary geospatial data can provide more valuable information for SMC estimation, which shows promise for precision agriculture applications.},

This includes ground-based proximal sensing technologies that are able to compete with satellite and aircraft observation systems, due to low operational costs, high operational flexibility, and high spatial resolution. This article was therefore designed to compare the performance of multiple sensing systems mounted on a smart buggy platform. A number of proximal sensing technologies were then evaluated and intercompared for their accuracy in retrieving high resolution near-surface soil moisture. The sensors tested included an L-band microwave radiometer (ELBARA III), a global navigation satellite system reflectometer sensor (LARGO), and an electromagnetic induction sensor (EM38). Data were collected during the fifth Soil Moisture Active Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) in Yanco, NSW, Australia, in September 2015. Observations from each sensor were converted to surface soil moisture values which were in turn evaluated against reference measurements obtained by in situ soil moisture measurements. The sensing technologies tested here have been individually assessed by many other studies, but within different regions and environments including surface condition, local weather, observing height, size of footprint, etc. Consequently, this article has used a single platform to intercompare the different sensors to be evaluated concurrently. Results from this article indicated that the L-band microwave radiometer achieved the best performance in retrieving surface soil moisture. The average RMSE and R were found to be 0.055 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.68 for ELBARA III, 0.084 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.51 for LARGO, and 0.090 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.32 for the EM38.},

The primary objective of this work was to explore whether improved Brutsaert's model (Poisson's ratio dynamic solution model is introduced) can more accurately predict soil volumetric water content (SVWC) than traditional Brutsaert's model. Acoustic velocities (the first compressional wave and shear wave) of natural silica sand (sand) and three different textures of farming soils (loam, sandy loam and clay loam) were measured using pulsed acoustic waves with frequencies less than 900 Hz under the conditions of wet swelling and drying shrinkage, respectively. The traditional Brutsaert's model and improved Brutsaert's model are validated by the measured acoustic velocities. We compare the result calculated by improved Brustsaert's model with that calculcated by traditional Brustsaert's model. The compared results show that the improved Brustsaert's model is more suitable for measuring the relationship between the velocity and the soil water content (SWC) than traditional Brustsaert's model in four different textures of soil samples. In order to verify the feasibility of the improved Brustsaert's model for predicting soil water content (SWC), field experiments were carried out on three kinds farming soil (loam, sandy loam and clay loam) sampling sites.

	abstract = {The satellite monitoring of vegetation moisture content (VMC) and soil moisture content (SMC) in Southern European Atlantic mountains remains poorly understood but is a fundamental tool to better manage landscape moisture dynamics under climate change. In the Atlantic humid mountains of Portugal, we investigated an empirical model incorporating satellite (Sentinel-1 radar, S1; Sentinel-2 optical, S2) and ancillary predictors (topography and vegetation cover type) to monitor VMC (\%) and SMC (\%). Predictors derived from the S1 (VV, HH and VV/HH) and S2 (NDVI and NDMI) are compared to field measurements of VMC (n = 48) and SMC (n = 48) obtained during the early, mid and end of summer. Linear regression modelling was applied to uncover the feasibility of a landscape model for VMC and SMC, the role of vegetation type models (i.e. native forest, grasslands and shrubland) to enhance predictive capacity and the seasonal variation in the relationships between satellite predictors and VMC and SMC. Results revealed a significant but weak relationship between VMC and predictors at landscape level (R2 = 0.30, RMSEcv = 69.9 \%) with S2\_NDMI and vegetation cover type being the only significant predictors. The relationship improves in vegetation type models for grasslands (R2 = 0.35, RMSEcv = 95.0 \% with S2\_NDVI) and shrublands conditions (R2 = 0.52, RMSEcv = 45.3 \%). A model incorporating S2\_NDVI and S1\_VV explained 52 \% of the variation in VMC in shrublands. The relationship between SMC and satellite predictors at the landscape level was also weak, with only the S2\_NDMI and vegetation cover type exhibiting a significant relationship (R2 = 0.28, RMSEcv = 18.9 \%). Vegetation type models found significant associations with SMC only in shrublands (R2 = 0.31, RMSEcv = 9.03 \%) based on the S2\_NDMI and S1\_VV/VH ratio. The seasonal analysis revealed however that predictors associated to VMC and SMC may vary over the summer. The relationships with VMC were stronger in the early summer (R2 = 0.31, RMSEcv = 90.1 \%; based on S2\_NDMI) and mid (R2 = 0.37, RMSEcv = 70.8 \%; based on S2\_NDVI), butnon-significant in the end of summer. Similar pattern was found for SMC, where the link with predictors decreases from the early summer (R2 = 0.33, RMSEcv = 16.0 \%; based on S1\_VH) and mid summer (R2 = 0.30, RMSEcv = 17.8 \%; based on S2\_NDMI) to the end of summer (non-significant). Overall, the hypothesis of a universal landscape model for VMC and SMC was not fully supported. Vegetation type models showed promise, particularly for VMC in shrubland conditions. Sentinel optical and radar data were the most significant predictors in all models, despite the inclusion of ancillary predictors. S2\_NDVI, S2\_NDMI, S1\_VV and S1\_VV/VH ratio were the most relevant predictors for VMC and, to a lesser extent, SMC. Future research should quantify misregistration effects using plot vs. moving window values for the satellite predictors, consider meteorological control factors, and enhance sampling to overcome a main limitation of our study, small sample size.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter in determining crop growth and yield. Modern agriculture does not only take into account soil moisture measurements obtained once at selected points in the field, but also focuses on moisture monitoring. Knowledge of the variability over time and analysis of the variation in readings caused by heavy rainfall or strong sunshine and high soil temperature changes is very important for future modelling, prediction and automated irrigation. The aim of this paper is to present a developed soil moisture monitoring system for a soil profile up to 34 cm depth incorporating Internet of Things technologies. The system was built based on an eight-channel time domain reflectometer to measure soil moisture based on dielectric properties. The developed system integrates both dielectric moisture measurement and innovative web-based server and visualisation services. The autonomous station was equipped with a long-range wireless communication and a solar-charged battery. Analysis of the results enabled us to observe the subtle deviations of moisture content of the upper soil layer during diurnal cycles. The designed station can be used in the future to integrate a high accuracy automatic field irrigation system and acquire data for precision agriculture.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter of the climate system as it relates to plant transpiration and photosynthesis and impacts land-atmosphere interactions. Recent developments have seen an increasing number of electromagnetic sensors available commercially (EM) for soil volumetric water content (theta). Their use is constantly expanding, and they are becoming increasingly used for agricultural, ecological, and geotechnical applications and climate research, providing decision support and high-resolution data for models and machine-learning algorithms. In this study, a soil moisture sensor network consisting of 10 Sense Cap capacitance-based sensors is evaluated. Analytical performance of the sensors was determined based on laboratory and field measurements with dielectric permittivity (epsilon) standards and soil media substrates. Sensor response normalisation to standards of known epsilon was found to reduce intersensor variability and provide robust estimates of theta in soil samples with known theta. Cross-comparison with a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) instrument carried out in two soil media demonstrates good agreement between the two probes throughout the tested range. The data communication performance of the network was evaluated in terms of packet drop rate at different ranges and sampling frequencies. It was noticed that the drop rate increased with distance from the gateway, while sampling frequency had no effect. Sources of errors associated with probe installation were identified and recommendations are provided for sensor deployment. The off-the-shelf all-in-one solution provided by Sense Cap is low cost, user friendly and suitable for implementation at temporal and spatial scales once the identified shortcomings are addressed. The evaluation presented aims to aid stakeholders and users involved in soil and land management practices including crop production, soil conservation, carbon sequestration and pollutants transport.},

Prior to the in-field measurements, calibration methods for the sensor to correct the influences on soil temperature and electrical conductivity (EC) of the soil water were established. Dried soil collected from the agricultural field, pure water, and an in-laboratory thermostatic reservoir were used. First, calibration formulas for the soil temperature and EC were obtained using a dataset of laboratory measurements. Second, the soil water content in the field was measured using the 5TE sensor with three different calibration curves, applying: (A) no correction of EC for curves at 20 degrees C, (B) temperature correction only, and (C) temperature and EC corrections. The differences between the sensor and actual measurements were (1) 2.5\%, (2) 2.5\%, and (3) 2.2\% expressed as volumetric soil water content (m3 m-3). Higher accuracy was confirmed in the 5TE-sensor measurements under condition (3) at higher EC values. Finally, we demonstrated that the 5TE sensor with the proposed calibration method is useful for monitoring soil water content in agricultural fields.},

Smart meter devices, Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, and wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are only a few examples of the innovative systems increasingly employed from an Agriculture 4.0 point of view. Recent literature has paid close attention to the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) algorithms in helping farmers and improving soil productivity. In this regard, this article presents the design of a WSN based on low-cost, low-power photovoltaic (PV)-supplied sensor nodes able to acquire data regarding environmental conditions and soil parameters. Among all the implemented sensors, the most critical is the soil moisture sensors because of many issues related to cost, installation, reliability, and calibration. Thus, this article proposes a DL approach based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to provide a virtual soil moisture sensor using only the data acquired by the other transducer installed on the node. Performance estimation of the virtual sensors and an in-depth comparison with other learning-based approaches have been presented in this article to validate the effectiveness of the proposed soft sensing approach.},

	abstract = {Land surface temperature and fractional vegetation coverage (LST/FVC) space is a classical model for monitoring soil moisture (SMC) from optical/thermal remote sensing. However, its applications are critically constrained by the determination of the dry and wet boundaries. In this study, a semi-empirical method was provided for determining the dry boundary by introducing a parallel resistance following the Biome-BGC (BioGeochemical Cycles) model to determine the temperature endmembers on the dry boundary. The semi-empirical method was evaluated by comparing with typical theoretical calculation methods in calculating soil moisture index (SMI) based on the LST/FVC space. Public datasets from SMAPVEX12 (Soil Moisture Active Passive mission Validation Experiment 2012) experiment, MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer), and NLDAS-2 (North American Land Data Assimilation System) Forcing Dataset were utilized in the evaluation. Results demonstrated that the semi-empirical method has comparable performances with the theoretical methods in monitoring the spatial variation of SMC. The SMIs based on the semi-empirical and theoretical methods are significantly correlated at a high level of Pearson's correlation coefficients (r) around 0.8-0.9 with p-value = 0.05. More importantly, this semi-empirical method requires fewer parameters and does not require a complex iteration calculating process as compared with previous theoretical methods.},

	abstract = {In this study, the current Met Office operational land surface data assimilation system used to produce soil moisture analyses is presented. The main aim of including Land Surface Data Assimilation (LSDA) in both the global and regional systems is to improve forecasts of surface air temperature and humidity. Results from trials assimilating pseudo-observations of 1.5 m air temperature and specific humidity and satellite-derived soil wetness (ASCAT) observations are analysed. The pre-processing of all the observations is described, including the definition and construction of the pseudo-observations. The benefits of using both observations together to produce improved forecasts of surface air temperature and humidity are outlined both in the winter and summer seasons. The benefits of using active LSDA are quantified by the root mean squared error, which is computed using both surface observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses as truth. For the global model trials, results are presented separately for the Northern (NH) and Southern (SH) hemispheres. When compared against ground-truth, LSDA in winter NH appears neutral, but in the SH it is the assimilation of ASCAT that contributes to approximately a 2\% improvement in temperatures at lead times beyond 48 h. In NH summer, the ASCAT soil wetness observations degrade the forecasts against observations by about 1\%, but including the screen level pseudo-observations provides a compensating benefit. In contrast, in the SH, the positive effect comes from including the ASCAT soil wetness observations, and when both observations types are assimilated there is a compensating effect. Finally, we demonstrate substantial improvements to hydrological prediction when using land surface data assimilation in the regional model. Using the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) metric as an aggregated measure of river flow simulation skill relative to observations, we find that NSE was improved at 106 of 143 UK river gauge locations considered after LSDA was introduced. The number of gauge comparisons where NSE exceeded 0.5 is also increased from 17 to 28 with LSDA.},

After each reading, the samples were weighted to calculate. (m3 m-3). Fourteen regression models (linear, linearized, and nonlinear) were adjusted to the calibration data and checked for their residue distribution. Only the exponential model with three parameters met the regression assumptions regarding residue distribution. The stepwise regression was used to obtain multiple linear equations to estimate the adjusted parameters of the calibration model from soil attributes, with silt and clay contents providing the best relations. Both the specific and the general calibrations performed well, with RMSE values of 0.02 and 0.03 m(3) m(-3), respectively. Manufacturer calibration and equations from the literature were much less accurate, reinforcing the need to develop specific calibrations.},

	abstract = {Accurate and timely evaluation of soil water content (SWC) in water-limited arid and semiarid regions will provide an essential reference for scientifically based water management strategies and vegetation restoration practices. Theoretical and empirical models based on remote sensing data have been successfully applied to predict large-scale SWC. However, most existing models are limited to the surface soil layer, while the prediction of SWC in the deep soil layer (1-5 m) has been overlooked because of the shortage of long-term and large-scale filed-observed data. In this study, a south-north transect (ca. 860 km) was selected across the Chinese Loess Plateau (CLP). Based on both long-term remote sensing and in-situ data (2013-2016), pedo-transfer functions (PTFs) for the SWC in the 0-5 m profile were developed using multiple regression, random forest, and artificial neural network. The results showed that evapotranspiration, potential evapotranspiration, soil surface temper-ature, total shortwave broadband albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index were important remote sensing parameters, whereas soil texture and bulk density were important in-situ parameters for SWC PTFs development. Among the three PTF development methods, machine learning (i.e. random forest and artificial neural network) obtained a higher accuracy than multiple regression. For different combinations of input pa-rameters, the introduction of in-situ factors significantly improved the accuracy of PTFs compared with PTFs based on remote sensing data only. The artificial neural network developed a PTF with only five input variables that predicted SWC with reasonable accuracy (root mean square error symbolscript 0.039, R2 symbolscript 0.697, mean absolute percentage symbolscript 24.8) and is thus useful for many applications on the Loess Plateau of China. In the future, more attention should be given to the role of in-situ parameters when developing PTFs for deep SWC prediction.},

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to examine the effects of different basal fertilizers, including inorganic, organic, and compost fertilizers, and the application ratio of basal and additional fertilizers on nutrient contents with an EC sensor. The applied basal and additional fertilizer ratios were N 30:70, K 40:60, and N 20:80, K 20:80, respectively, for each fertilizer treatment. The results showed that the EC sensor value was positively associated with water content. The soil EC response increased with inorganic fertilizer and fertigation, and it was positively correlated with soluble nutrients and exchangeable ammonium. The correlation coefficients between sensor EC and soluble nutrients, nitrate, and ammonium nitrogen were 0.87, 0.86, and 0.65, respectively. The principal component analysis (PCA) also elucidated that inorganic fertilizer was positively associated with sensor EC, soluble Na, Ca, Mg, and nitrate among variables. This work suggests that soil available nutrients, especially N, could be monitored with an EC sensor, and the soil nutrient status could be regulated to promote better plant growth.},

Consequently, use of agro-hydrological models and irrigation management can be affected. This work has the following objectives: (i) to analyze if the type of sensor and the frequency of SWC measurement used in the transient water flow experiments for IM affect the results regarding SHP; (ii) to assess if variations on the SWC measurement frequencies affect the results of SHP to the point of causing effects on the agro-hydrological modelling through SWAP model and on the passion fruit irrigation management based on soil water sensing; (iii) point out strategies for the correct irrigation management based on SHP obtained by IM. The results regarding SHP were applied to the modelling of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and SWC with the use of SWAP agro-hydrological model. The type of sensor and the frequency of SWC data measurements interfered in the results regarding SHP obtained by IM, with implications on the agro-hydrological modelling and on the irrigation management through soil water sensing (SWS). The results of this study alert for the differences that may occur in SWC values when those are obtained from matric potential through soil water retention curves. This is specially important for higher and lower critical matric potentials used as reference for the moment to turn on and off a irrigation. When using GS1 sensors for IM, it is recommended to use intervals of SWC data measurement of 1 h, as the TDR sensors performed better with SWC data acquisition frequency between 1 and 12 h. Finally, it is understood that the factors that affect agro-hydrological modeling and the performance of the type of soil water sensor are diverse and integrated in a complex nonlinear way, for instance: atmospheric condition, soil texture and structure, topography, presence/absence of plants, soil and irrigation management practices. Thus, similar studies should be carried out considering variations in these factors so that a generalist and integrated conclusion is possible.},

On Arenosol, there were only small changes in the parameters as the incubation period increased, suggesting less intense P transformation to tightly sorbed form. The P-W/P-IE ratio enhanced with increasing P-doses, and the ratios were higher on Arenosol. On Arenosol, the higher P doses caused a greater increase of PW than on Chernozem.

Due to the impracticality of maintaining ground instrumentation over wide geographic areas, remote sensing and numerical model-based fine-scale mapping of soil water conditions have been applied for water resource applications at a range of spatial scales. Here, we present a prototype framework for integrating high-resolution thermal infrared (TIR) and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing data into a soil-vegetation-atmosphere-transfer (SVAT) model with the aim of providing improved estimates of surface- and root-zone soil moisture that can support optimized irrigation management strategies. Specifically, remotely-sensed estimates of water stress (from TIR) and surface soil moisture retrievals (from SAR) are assimilated into a 30-m resolution SVAT model over a vineyard site in the Central Valley of California, U.S. The efficacy of our data assimilation algorithm is investigated via both the synthetic and real data experiments. Results demonstrate that a particle filtering approach is superior to an ensemble Kalman filter for handling the nonlinear relationship between model states and observations. In addition, biophysical conditions such as leaf area index are shown to impact the relationship between observations and states and must therefore be represented accurately in the assimilation model. Overall, both surface and root-zone soil moisture predicted via the SVAT model are enhanced through the assimilation of thermal and radar-based retrievals, suggesting the potential for improving irrigation management at the agricultural sub-field-scale using a data assimilation strategy.},

	abstract = {Capacitance sensors are widely used in agriculture for irrigation and soil management purposes. However, their use under saline conditions is a major challenge, especially for sensors operating with low frequency. Their dielectric readings are often biased by high soil electrical conductivity. New calculation approaches for soil water content (theta) and pore water electrical conductivity (ECp), in which apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) is included, have been suggested in recent research. However, these methods have neither been tested with low-cost capacitance probes such as the 5TE (70 MHz, Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) nor for field conditions. Thus, it is important to determine the performance of these approaches and to test the application range using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soils. For this purpose, sandy soil was collected from the Jemna oasis in southern Tunisia and four 5TE sensors were installed in the field at four soil depths. Measurements of apparent dielectric permittivity (Ka), ECa, and soil temperature were taken under different electrical conductivity of soil moisture solutions. Results show that, under field conditions, 5TE accuracy for theta estimation increased when considering the ECa effect. Field calibrated models gave better theta estimation (root mean square error (RMSE) = 0.03 m(3) m(-3)) as compared to laboratory experiments (RMSE = 0.06 m(3) m(-3)). For ECp prediction, two corrections of the Hilhorst model were investigated. The first approach, which considers the ECa effect on K' reading, failed to improve the Hilhorst model for ECp {\textgreater} 3 dS m(-1) for both laboratory and field conditions. However, the second approach, which considers the effect of ECa on the soil parameter K-0, increased the performance of the Hilhorst model and gave accurate measurements of ECp using the 5TE sensor for irrigated soil.},

Phase, amplitude, and reflector height, which are SNR-derived interferogram metrics are examined and results are proofed with respect to correlation coefficients compared with in-situ measurements. Here, Soil Moisture Content (SMC) is estimated from SNR data with four data analyzing strategies using Lomb Scargle Periodogram to retrieve dominant frequency as; (1) considering it is four times greater than background noise assuming the reflector height is inconstant in each day, (2) considering it is three times greater than background noise assuming the reflector height is inconstant in each day, (3) assuming the reflector height is constant and median values are used for overall estimations in each day, (4) assuming the reflector height is constant and median values are used in each day. To do that, the GPS Interferometric Reflectometry (GPS-IR) method was implemented to the data of OSOR station, installed in Chile (within the scope of the CAP Andes GPS Network Project carried out by UNAVCO), during 213 days from 01 January 2015 to 31 July 2015. Validation of the estimates is done by the recorded soil moistures from the Oromo Calibration Site in the LAB-net network. Results show that SMC estimated from SNR-derived metrics shows well agreement with in-situ measurements i.e. as the highest correlation of 95\%; whilst the second strategy was followed.},

The Biogeosystem Technique (BGT*) priming action system was developed for soil management to provide a higher-level priming effect.

Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a cooperation of bacteria within polymicrobial biofilms and a probability of the polymicrobial biofilms biodegradation process acceleration and soil organic matter (SOM) regime improvement. The soil priming actions the BGT* technological management is capable of providing are based on the BGT* constituents, whose essence, applications and corresponding detailed data are presented in available studies. The main BGT* components are as follows. The illuvial horizon intra-soil milling artificial soil aggregation (a form of crumbling and mixing) priming action provides the soil structuring, a SOM content increase and an annual yield increment direct priming effects. A long-term secondary priming effect is a technology life cycle with higher profitability compared to the standard moldboard, chiseling and three-tier plowing. The intra-soil pulse sequential-discrete watering priming action is performed through water injection into the soil in sequence. A next water spreading provides the soil aggregate stability, the seedling length and weight increment direct priming effect and a water-saving secondary priming effect. The intra-soil dispersed liquid, paste-like and loose granular nutrition and structuring matter intra-soil milling application priming action ensures soil structuring direct priming effects, heavy metals passivation and long-term yield increment secondary priming effects.

Conventional sensors with a SiNx top film sometimes cannot detect changes in the water content in soil resulting from rain. Experiments on the slide distances of water droplets were performed using SiOx and SiNx films. As the slide distance of the SiOx film was shorter than that of the SiNx film, it was confirmed that the SiOx film is more hydrophilic than the SiNx film. To improve contact characteristics between the sensor surface and free water in soil, we covered our conventional sensor chip with a hydrophilic SiOx film. As a contact property test, the sensor chip measured the impedances of model soils. The proposed sensor achieved stable contact with the free water in the soil. Moreover, the chip operated for a long period of time on a mountain slope. The sensor could measure nearly theoretical outputs in response to rainfall. Thus, we succeeded in fabricating a stable soil monitor sensor with a hydrophilic SiOx film.},

	doi = {10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.115763},
	abstract = {Understanding the physical, chemical, and biological processes and estimating water balance in drylands rely on accurate soil moisture (theta) measurements. Surface soil moisture is influenced by the presence and types of biocrusts because they strongly modify surface soil properties and hydrological processes. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to precisely measure the theta of such thin biocrust layer and to evaluate biocrusts' roles in soil water balance. Due to the large sensing range (usually {\textgreater}= 5 cm), the most dielectric soil moisture sensors are incapable of accurately measuring near-surface ({\textless}= 5 cm) theta, although they have been widely used for this purpose. Conversely, the heat-pulse (HP) sensor possibly performs better in measuring surface theta of biocrust layer because of its smaller sensing range (1.2 cm). In this study, we assessed the performance of HP sensor in investigating the surface theta differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil on the northern Chinese Loess Plateau. We measured surface theta of biocrusts and bare soil for one year at 1 cm depth using HP sensors, and at 2 or 5 cm depths using three common dielectric sensors based on alternative measurement principles. Our results showed that the relationship of theta and heat capacity from the HP sensor was quite well-fitted by a linear regression function (R-2 = 0.96), and the theta measured by HP sensor in the field agreed well with the oven-drying 0 (root-mean-square error {\textless}= 0.015 cm(3) cm(-3) and mean deviation {\textless} 0.007 cm(3) cm(-3)). The HP sensor measured a 44\% greater theta under biocrusts compared to bare soil throughout the experimental period, in contrast to lesser differences detected with the other sensors (17\%-33\%). Furthermore, the biocrust increased theta by 100\% in the dry season (Nov.-Apr.) and by 40\% in the wet season (May-Oct.) in contrast to bare soil based on the HP sensor. Moreover, the theta of biocrusts measured by HP sensor was 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3) higher than that of bare soil under the periods without rainfall, but the biocrusts increased theta by 0.05-0.10 cm(3) cm(-3) in contrast to bare soil after rainfall. The apparent differences among different types of sensors were reasonably attributed to their variable sensing ranges and volumes of measured soil. Although the installation depths were different among HP sensor and dielectric sensors, HP sensor was undoubtedly more suitable in measuring near-surface theta and sensitive enough to detect even non-rainfall water inputs (dew, fog, and water vapor sorption) into the soil. In conclusion, the theta differences between moss-dominated biocrusts and bare soil are mostly underestimated by common dielectric sensors compared to HP sensors. Therefore, biocrusts play a more vital role in surface water balance of drylands than we generally recognized before.},

During this period of design freedom, multi-objective optimization can provide a useful lens into the design space by showing theoretical performance limits and illuminating design tradeoffs. This work optimizes a radar constellation for a potential soil moisture mission. Several different optimization cases with different variables are considered and contrasted. The optimization of the instrument and constellation parameters is considered jointly and separately to better understand the effect of coupling on the optimization performance. A science-driven optimization based on soil moisture retrieval error is compared with a performance-metric-driven optimization. Pareto analysis and association rule mining are performed on the generated designs to provide insight into driving features. Design recommendations are made for several cost caps. Results show that optimization that considers the instrument and constellation design together find superior revisit metrics than treating instrument and constellation separately. The use of the science value metric as an optimization objective shows that while cost may always be increased to improve instrument and constellation performance, the difference in science value may be negligible. These findings can inform tradespace exploration studies for similar problems.},

This research aimed to design and calibrate a locally manufactured low-cost soil moisture sensor attached to a smart monitoring unit operated by Solar Photo Voltaic Cells (SPVC). The designed sensor was evaluated on clay textured soils in both lab and controlled greenhouse environments. The calibration results demonstrated a strong correlation between sensor readings and soil volumetric water content (theta(V)). Higher soil moisture content was associated with decreased sensor output voltage with an average determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.967 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.014. A sensor-to-sensor variability test was performed yielding a 0.045 coefficient of variation.

Soil monitoring has seen a push toward fifth generation (5G) telecommunications technology, due to the higher speed and bandwidth required to connect a huge number of sensor nodes simultaneously. A novel architecture for a fully integrated, unequal arms dipole antenna is presented in this article. The proposed on-chip antenna is implemented using UMC180 nm CMOS technology. A dipole radiator is added on the upper metal layer, a ground sheet set at the lower metal layer and a patch layer is added on the intermediate metal layer. This configuration has improved the antenna impedance bandwidth by 38\%. In addition, it increased the electrical length of the dipole antenna to reduce the antenna resonant frequency by 10 GHz. The proposed antenna has a total area 1300 x 250 mu m, and its wide bandwidth extends from 21 to 40 GHz at reflection coefficient {\textbar}S-11{\textbar} {\textless} -7 dB, which makes it suitable for on-chip wireless sensor network applications in 5G technology. All Simulations are completed by using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency structure simulator) ver.15 and the simulated results show a good comparison with measurements. To investigate the proposed antenna's performance in different environmental conditions, practical measurements for soil dielectric constant in different compositions with variable moisture ratios are applied. The resulting values are used in antenna simulation and have ultimately proved the antenna's improved capability to sense soil moisture in different conditions.},

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a novel soil moisture sensing system, named as SoilId, that combines a UAV and a COTS IR-UWB radar for wide-area soil moisture sensing without the need of burying any battery-powered in-ground device. Specifically, we design a series of novel methods to help SoilId extract soil moisture related features from the received radar signals, and automatically detect and discard the data contaminated by the UAV's uncontrollable motion and the multipath interference. Furthermore, we leverage the powerful representation ability of deep neural networks and carefully design a neural network model to accurately map the extracted radar signal features to soil moisture estimations. We have extensively evaluated SoilId against a variety of real-world factors, including the UAV's uncontrollable motion, the multipath interference, soil surface coverages, and many others. Specifically, the experimental results carried out by our UAV-based system validate that SoilId can push the accuracy limits of RF-based soil moisture sensing techniques to a 50\% quantile MAE of 0.23\%.},

However, in recent years, these forests have faced significant challenges due to prolonged climate-change-induced droughts, causing water shortages, tree stress, and pest outbreaks. One of the key components of the forests' vitality and productivity is the availability of soil moisture. Given the anticipated increase in the frequency and severity of drought events, there is a growing demand for accurate and real-time soil moisture information. This underscores the need for development of an appropriate monitoring tool to make forest management strategies more effective.The article introduces an operational high-resolution soil moisture monitoring framework for the forests in central Germany. The key components of this system include the advanced LWF-BROOK90 1D water balance model, a large database of the National Federal Forest Inventory, high-resolution forest soil maps, real-time climate data from the German Meteorological Service, and a web information platform for the presentation of daily updated results. This system informs the public and empowers forest managers and other decision-makers to take targeted, local measures for sustainable forest management, aiding in both drought mitigation and long-term forest health in the face of climate change. The validation of the system using soil moisture measurements from 51 stations with various sensor depths (up to 100 cm) showed an overall good agreement (0.76 median Pearson correlation), which was found to be higher for deciduous rather than coniferous forests. Finally, the framework is discussed against the background of the main limitations of existing monitoring systems and how operational soil moisture measurements contribute to better interpretation of simulations.},

We offer one of the very first validation studies on a dry-down event captured by a novel L-band radiometer onboard a Black Swift Technologies fixed-wing S2 UAS. A fallow cornfield at the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center was selected as a study area to validate volumetric soil moisture estimates in mid-April.

Sensor readings were plotted against gravimetrically measured volumetric soil moisture (theta(v)) for different textural classes as a reference. The coefficient of determination (r(2)) was used to select the best fit of the regression function. The developed calibration equations were evaluated using an independent dataset. The results indicated that all developed textural and lumped site-specific calibration equations were linear functions, with r(2) values ranging from 0.96 to 0.99. Relationships between the measured and estimated. v from calibration equations were reasonable at all sites, with r(2) values greater than 0.91 and root mean square error (RMSE) values ranging from 0.010 to 0.020 m(3).m(-3).

Despite efforts in estimating irrigation water withdrawals in earth system models, uncertainties and discrepancies exist within and across modeling systems conditioned by model structure, irrigation parameterization, and the choice of input datasets. Achieving model reliability could be much more challenging for data-sparse regions, given limited access to ground truth for parameterization and validation. Here, we demonstrate the potential of utilizing remotely sensed vegetation and soil moisture observations in constraining irrigation estimation in the Noah-MP land surface model. Results indicate that the two constraints together can effectively reduce model sensitivity to the choice of irrigation parameterization by 7\%-43\%. It also improves the characterization of the spatial patterns of irrigation and its impact on evapotranspiration and surface soil moisture by correcting for vegetation conditions and irrigation timing. This study highlights the importance of utilizing remotely sensed soil moisture and vegetation measurements in detecting irrigation signals and correcting for vegetation growth. Integrating the two remote sensing datasets into the model provides an effective and less feature engineered approach to constraining the uncertainty of irrigation modeling. Such strategies can be potentially transferred to other modeling systems and applied to regions across the globe.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) exists at the land-atmosphere interface and serves as a key driving variable that affects global water balance and vegetation growth. Its importance in climate and earth system studies necessitates a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of mainstream global remote sensing/reanalysis SM products. In this study, we conducted a thorough verification of ten global remote sensing/reanalysis SM products: SMAP DCA, SMAP SCA-H, SMAP SCA-V, SMAP-IB, SMOS IC, SMOS L3, LPRM\_C1, LPRM\_C2, LPRM\_X, and ERA5-Land. The verification was based on ground observation data from the International SM Network (ISMN), considering both static factors (such as climate zone, land cover type, and soil type) and dynamic factors (including SM, leaf area index, and land surface temperature). Our goal was to assess the accuracy and applicability of these products. We analyzed the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of global SM and discussed the vegetation effect on SM products. Additionally, we examined the global high-frequency fluctuations in the SMAP L-VOD product, along with their correlation with the normalized difference vegetation index, leaf area index, and vegetation water content. Our findings revealed that product quality was higher in regions located in tropical and arid zones, closed shrubs, loose rocky soil, and gray soil with low soil moisture, low leaf area index, and high average land surface temperature. Among the evaluated products, SMAP-IB, SMAP DCA, SMAP SCA-H, SMAP SCA-V, and ERA5-Land consistently performed better, demonstrating a good ability to capture the spatial and temporal variations in SM and showing a correlation of approximately 0.60 with ISMN. SMOS IC and SMOS L3 followed in performance, while LPRM\_C1, LPRM\_C2, and LPRM\_X exhibited relatively poor results in SM inversion. These findings serve as a valuable reference for improving satellite/reanalysis SM products and conducting global-scale SM studies.},

This study aims to assimilate this surface SM product into a recently developed model, namely Statistical Soil Moisture Profile (SSMP) model, to investigate the efficacy of this combination in developing a vertical soil moisture profile database over a climatologically vast area, such as Indian mainland. The SSMP model is a spatially varying statistical framework that couples the memory and forcing of SM from the overlying layers and utilizes the information of Hydrologic Soil Groups (HSGs) that makes it spatially transferable. The model estimates SM at four depths i.e. 10, 20, 51 and 102 cm using the surface SM information (similar to 0-5 cm). The developed database is named as `ESA-CCI Driven Vertical Soil Moisture Profile (root zone) Database (EDVSMPD)' and the simulated values are validated with observed SM data at many monitoring stations across India, maintained by India Meteorological Department (IMD). As an exemplary demonstration of the utility of the data, basin scale reconstruction of the historical agricultural droughts and its spatial distribution, using the developed EDVSMPD product, is illustrated for a medium sized drought-stricken river basin, namely Wardha, in the central part of India. The resulting SM product for a considerable length of period (more than 30 years) will be immensely useful for many hydro-climatological studies.},

	abstract = {Remotely sensed (RS) evapotranspiration (ET) models have been widely used to estimate ET over large areas. However, a common challenge for these models is the lack of reliable soil moisture (SM) constraints. Due to the lack of reliable, spatiotemporal continuous SM profile data, existing RS-ET models tend to use atmospheric or land surface variables as proxies for SM constraints. Although several proxy algorithms for SM constraints have been developed, few studies have evaluated their performance in ET simulations. To address this gap, we evaluated the applicability of five proxy algorithms for SM constraints (namely, fVPD, fLST, fDT, fZhang, and fdrying) to ET simulations in China using the Penman-Monteith-Leuning (PML) model. These algorithms were evaluated at 14 ChinaFlux sites and 286 basins using flux tower measurements and water balance-based ET estimates, respectively. The results show that among the five algorithms, fdrying performs test at the flux sites, with a median of Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.75. The second-best algorithm is fZhang (KGE = 0.73), followed by fDT (KGE = 0.70), fLST (KGE = 0.68), and fVPD (KGE = 0.65). The performance ranking of the five algorithms at the basin scale is consistent with that at the flux sites. Using the flux site SM measurements as a reference, we further found that the algorithms with better performance in ET simulations also have better SM simulation capabilities. This study highlights the importance of reliable SM constraints in the RS-ET models.},

Traditionally, the analysis of this relationship is restricted by the spatial coverage of both soil moisture and precipitation data that are collected through in-situ observations at limited locations. In this study, we utilized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s remote sensing products of soil moisture (SMAP: Soil Moisture Active Passive) and precipitation (TRMM: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), which provide near-global coverage, to investigate the co-variation of precipitation and soil moisture regionally, as a function of ecosystem types and climate regimes. We apply information on land cover and climate regimes to provide insight about correlation strength of soil moisture and precipitation. The results indicate that most of the globe has a moderate to strong positive correlation of SMAP soil moisture and TRMM precipitation data during the study period. In relation to land cover, soil moisture and precipitation have the strongest correlations in regions of limited vegetation, whereas forests and densely vegetated regions have weaker correlations. As for climate regimes, they have the strongest correlations in arid or cold regions, and weaker correlations in humid, temperate locations. While remotely sensed soil moisture data are less reliable in dense vegetation, these results confirm that drier, less vegetated climates show a highly linear relationship between soil moisture and rainfall.},

The results showed a reasonably good correlation between electrical conductivity and water content. The determination coefficient between the water content and the electrical conductivity found by the oven method (R-2 approximate to 0.8) was higher than that of the SMT (R-2 approximate to 0.6). The correlation between the water content values of oven and SMT is quite affordable with the determination coefficient (R-2 approximate to 0.7). Considering the results obtained from Oven and SMT method, it can be concluded that the resistivity method is also successful in measuring soil water content. It is foreseen that resistivity method can be preferred both because it is easy to use, and large areas are faster and economical in measuring soil water content.},

Due to challenges such as lack of natural resources and climate change, an efficient decision support system for irrigation is crucial. Evapotranspiration and soil water content are the most critical factors in irrigation scheduling. In this paper, the ability of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional LSTM (BLSTM) to model daily reference evapotranspiration and soil water content is investigated. The application of these techniques to predict these parameters was tested for three sites in Portugal. A single-layer BLSTM with 512 nodes was selected. Bayesian optimization was used to determine the hyperparameters, such as learning rate, decay, batch size, and dropout size.The model achieved the values of mean square error values within the range of 0.014 to 0.056 and R-2 ranging from 0.96 to 0.98. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was added to the LSTM to investigate potential performance improvement. Performance dropped in all datasets due to the complexity of the model. The performance of the models was also compared with CNN, traditional machine learning algorithms Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest. LSTM achieved the best performance. Finally, the impact of the loss function on the performance of the proposed models was investigated. The model with the mean square error as loss function performed better than the model with other loss functions.},

However, extracting soil water information from acoustic signals is still challenging. To tackle this issue, we have developed a low -frequency swept acoustic signal detection device and system. We conducted soil penetration testing using low -frequency swept acoustic signals. The swept -frequency acoustic signals passing through the soil were transformed into time-frequency spectrogram. Using the Swin-Transformer model, we established a regression model between the time-frequency spectrogram of the swept frequencies and the soil water content. Predictions were made both on a laboratory test dataset and through field trials using the calibrated model. The results indicate that the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values between the observed and the model's outputs of water content (\%) for the test laboratory dataset are 0.191, 0.081, and 0.999, respectively, using the Swin-Transformer model. In the case of the field trials, the RMSE, MAE, and R2 values between the predicted and observed values are 6.715 \%, 1.829 \%, and 0.711, respectively. These studies demonstrate that this method is highly effective in predicting soil water content, with the best results achieved at a resolution of 20 PPI (Pixels Per Inch) and within the frequency range of 260-360 Hz. It provides an efficient approach for acoustic soil water content detection, effectively resolves the difficulty in building models caused by the single -parameter limitation in traditional acoustic model.},

In this study, we combined multiple horizontal GPR measurements at different depths to investigate the spatial and temporal variability of the SWC under cropped plots. The SWC data were analyzed for four growing seasons between 2014 and 2017, two soil types (gravelly and clayeysilty), two crops (wheat [Triticum aestivum L.] and maize [Zea mays L.]), and three different water treatments. We acquired more than 150 time-lapse GPR datasets along 6-m-long horizontal crossholes at six depths. The GPR SWC distributions are distinct both horizontally and vertically for both soil types. A clear change in SWC can be observed at both sites between the surface layer ({\textgreater}0.3 m) and subsoil. Alternating patches of higher and lower SWC, probably caused by the soil heterogeneity, were observed along the horizontal SWC profiles. To investigate the changes in SWC with time, GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data were averaged for each depth and compared with changes in precipitation, treatment, and soil type. The high-temporal-resolution TDR and the large-sampling-volume GPR show similar trends in SWC for both sites, but because of the different sensing volumes, different responses were obtained due to the spatial heterogeneity. A difference in spatial variation of the crosshole GPR SWC data was detected between maize and wheat. The results for this 4-yr period indicate the potential of this novel experimental setup to monitor spatial and temporal SWC changes that can be used to study soil-plant-atmosphere interactions.},

In this paper, an improved DPHP-DTS method considering the soil bulk density was proposed. The measurement accuracy of the DPHP-DTS method under different heating strategies was studied in laboratory experiments, and its long-term stability in regard to the monitoring of soil moisture during natural evaporation in different soils was tested. The results show that the improved DPHP-DTS method can accurately measure the soil moisture, and the fitting algorithm can reduce the error caused by the accuracy of the DTS temperature measurement under the low-power heating strategy. Its measurement accuracy increases with the increase in the heating strength and duration.

Active radar provides an opportunity for finer resolution measurements; in particular, the interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) closure phase parameter is sensitive to changing soil moisture. We have developed a model showing that a systematic nonzero closure phase can result from scattering from objects at different depths in a medium of time-varying dielectric, such as from changes in soil moisture. The model predicts that interference between surface and subsurface reflections is needed for the closure phase to be nonzero. We find that, under certain circumstances, we can estimate soil moisture from the closure phase using a data reduction approach that includes a cumulative sum of the closure phase over time and the removal of a trend. The correlation between the cumulative closure phase and soil moisture suggests that the closure phase is related to the change in soil moisture. We examine a large test region in Oklahoma, where the detrended cumulative closure phase from Sentinel-1 data demonstrates some agreement with in situ soil moisture measurements. In other areas, the match is weaker, implying a terrain dependence on the quality of fit. The cumulative InSAR closure phase promises to provide a valuable new method to remotely estimate soil moisture.},

Precision Sustainable Agriculture (PSA) recently established a real-time soil moisture monitoring network across the central, Midwest, and eastern U.S., but continuous field-scale sensor observations often come with data gaps and anomalies. To maintain the data quality and continuity needed for developing decision tools, a quality control system is necessary. The International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) introduced the Flagit module for anomaly detection in soil moisture time series observations. However, under certain conditions, Flagit's threshold and spectral based quality control approaches may underperform in identifying anomalies. Recently, deep learning methods have been successfully applied to detect time series anomalies in time series data in various disciplines. However, their use in agriculture for anomaly detection in time series datasets has not been yet investigated. This study focuses on developing a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, referred to as DeepQC, to identify anomalies in soil moisture time series data. Manual flagged PSA observations were used for training, validation, and testing the model, following an 80:10:10 split. The study then compared the DeepQC and Flagit-based estimates to assess their relative performance. Flagit correctly flagged 95.8 \% of the correct observations and 50.3 \% of the anomaly observations, indicating its limitations in identifying anomalies, particularly at sites consists of more than 30 \% anomalies. On the other hand, the DeepQC correctly flagged 89.8 \% of the correct observations and 99.5 \% of the anomalies, with overall accuracy of 95.6 \%, in significantly less time, demonstrating its superiority over Flagit approach. Importantly, the performance of the DeepQC remained consistent regardless of the number of anomalies in site observations. Given the promising results obtained with the DeepQC, future studies will focus on implementing and finetuning this model on national and global soil moisture networks.},

What makes the SMOPS unique is its near real time global blended soil moisture product.

The version 3.0 SMOPS has been operationally released since 2017. Significant differences in climatological averages lead to remarkable distinctions in data quality between the newest and the older versions of SMOPS blended soil moisture products. This study reveals that the SMOPS version 3.0 has overwhelming advantages of reduced data uncertainties and increased correlations with respect to the quality controlled in situ measurements. The new version SMOPS also presents more robust agreements with the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA\_CCI) soil moisture datasets.

However, doubts remain about which sensor is preferable for delivering optimal prediction models and which preprocessing methods produce the most accurate results. Portable X-ray fluorescence (pXRF) spectrometry and visible near-infrared (Vis-NIR) diffuse reflectance spectroscopy have been widely used, while the NixProTM color sensor has been explored more recently. This study evaluated the use of pXRF, Vis-NIR, and NixProTM data to predict soil organic matter content (SOM), pH, base saturation (BS), the sum of bases (SB), cation exchange capacity (CEC) at pH = 7 and effective CEC (eCEC), via each sensor in isolation, and via combined sensors data. Moreover, factors interfering in the prediction models' accuracy (data preprocessing methods, soil horizon, soil class, parent material) were used as auxiliary variables. 604 soil samples were collected in Brazil, encompassing ten soil orders and 19 parent materials. Numerical and categorical prediction models (7,980) were created for six soil properties using a random forest algorithm, totaling 7980 models, delivering almost 24,000 results., Coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and residual prediction deviation (RPD) were used for validation of numerical predictions., Overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were calcualted for categorical predictions. Although the combination of sensors provided most of the best predictions, pXRF in isolation achieved accuracies close to the three sensors combined. NixProTM offered superior contributions to SOM and CEC predictions, but pXRF and Vis-NIR were responsible for the best results of most studied variables. On average, by adding pXRF to Vis-NIR data, predictive accuracy improved 32\%; while adding Vis-NIR to pXRF data increased accuracy by ca. 6\%. Soil-order-specific models improved predictions for Ultisols compared to general models (without soil order distinction), reaching R2 {\textgreater} 0.90. Soil parent material and horizon did not improve models significantly. Categorical predictions improved the accuracy for some properties, reaching an overall accuracy of 100\% and kappa index of 1.0 for pH in A horizons of Ultisols via pXRF + Vis-NIR data. Proximal sensor data with no auxiliary variables provided almost all the best results.

	abstract = {Waterlogging crop disasters are caused by continuous and excessive soil water in the upper layer of soil. In order to enable waterlogging monitoring, it is important to collect continuous and accurate soil moisture data. The distributed hydrology soil vegetation model (DHSVM) is selected as the basic hydrological model for soil moisture estimation and winter-wheat waterlogging monitoring. To handle the error accumulation of the DHSVM and the poor continuity of remote sensing (RS) inversion data, an agro-hydrological model that assimilates RS inversion data into the DHSVM is used for winter-wheat waterlogging monitoring. The soil moisture content maps retrieved from satellite images are assimilated into the DHSVM by the successive correction method. Moreover, in order to reduce the modeling error accumulation, monthly and real-time RS inversion maps that truly reflect local soil moisture distributions are regularly assimilated into the agro-hydrological modeling process each month. The results show that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the simulated soil moisture value at two in situ experiment points were 0.02077 and 0.02383, respectively, which were 9.96\% and 12.02\% of the measured value. From the accurate and continuous soil moisture results based on the agro-hydrological assimilation model, the waterlogging-damaged ratio and grade distribution information for winter-wheat waterlogging were extracted. The results indicate that there were almost no high-damaged-ratio and severe waterlogging damage areas in Lixin County, which was consistent with the local field investigation.},

	abstract = {The existing soil moisture sensing mechanism of the heat pulse probe (HPP) assumes the ideal condition of the soil while overlooking the physics of the device and the composition of the soil and its properties. In the present study, we propose modifications to the soil moisture sensing model of HPP by considering its physical parameters and their appropriate association with the thermal properties of soil and its mineral composition. Primarily, a novel model for the heat strength of the probe of HPP is proposed and examined. It results in R-2 = 0.9809, adjusted R-2 = 0.9721, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 5.73 W/m for experimentally measured values versus obtained values of heat strength using the proposed model. Subsequently, a soil composition-based model is developed resulting in a 19\%-25\% change in the bulk volumetric heat capacity of the soil. A final model of soil moisture estimation is developed by combining the heat strength of the probe of HPP, and the bulk volumetric heat capacity and porosity of the soil. The proposed model suggests improved results in soil moisture measurement in the range of -0.004 to 0.306 m(3)/m(3) which can be useful for different applications and several types of soil. Moreover, the model-predicted values of soil moisture are validated with experimental values in previous studies and linked with futuristic applications. R-2 = 0.9763, adjusted R-2 = 0.9527, and RMSE of 0.032 m(3)/m(3) are obtained for soil moisture measured experimentally versus values obtained using the proposed model.},

This study was conducted to investigate the optimal substrate moisture levels to efficiently produce young cymbidium using a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system over 42 weeks of vegetative growth. One-year-old cymbidium “Hoshino Shizuku” plantlets were grown in coir dust substrate at four levels of volumetric water content (0.25, 0.35, 0.45, and 0.55 m(3)center dot m(-3)). At harvest, the numbers of leaves and pseudobulbs, and the chlorophyll content of the cymbidiums did not differ among the four theta threshold treatments. However, plants grown at 0.25 m(3)center dot m(-3) had significantly smaller leaves, pseudobulbs, and biomass than those at the other theta threshold treatments. Although the lower theta decreased the photosynthetic parameters, such as the net photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and transpiration, there were no differences in the maximum quantum yield of photosystem II, indicating that the reduction in net photosynthesis is mostly mediated by stomatal closure. Although the net photosynthesis at theta of 0.35 m(3)center dot m(-3) was also lower than that at 0.55 m(3)center dot m(-3) treatment, biomass was significantly lower only at 0.25 m(3)center dot m(-3) treatment, suggesting that a critical growth reduction by the water deficit occurred for the cymbidium at 0.25 m(3)center dot m(-3). As the theta threshold increased, the total irrigation amount significantly increased, which inversely decreased the water use efficiency. Although the plants grown at 0.25 m(3)center dot m(-3) had the highest water use efficiency (WUE) and substrate electrical conductivity they showed significantly reduced growth compared to other theta threshold treatments, and thus this was not a reliable theta threshold level for producing high (visual) quality cymbidium. Overall, the 0.35 and 0.45 m(3)center dot m(-3) threshold treatments provided appropriate moisture levels for high-quality cymbidium production with high water use efficiency.},

	abstract = {The assimilation of radiometer and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data is a promising recent technique to downscale soil moisture products, yet it requires land surface parameters and meteorological forcing data at a high spatial resolution. In this study, we propose a new downscaling approach, named integrated passive and active downscaling (I-PAD), to achieve high spatial and temporal resolution soil moisture datasets over regions without detailed soil data. The Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer (AMSR-E) and Phased Array-type L-band SAR (PALSAR) data are combined through a dual-pass land data assimilation system to obtain soil moisture at 1 km resolution. In the first step, fine resolution model parameters are optimized based on fine resolution PALSAR soil moisture and moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index data, and coarse resolution AMSR-E brightness temperature data. Then, the 25 km AMSR-E observations are assimilated into a land surface model at 1 km resolution with a simple but computationally low-cost algorithm that considers the spatial resolution difference. Precipitation data are used as the only inputs from ground measurements. The evaluations at the two lightly vegetated sites in Mongolia and the Little Washita basin show that the time series of soil moisture are improved at most of the observation by the assimilation scheme. The analyses reveal that I-PAD can capture overall spatial trends of soil moisture within the coarse resolution radiometer footprints, demonstrating the potential of the algorithm to be applied over data-sparse regions. The capability and limitation are discussed based on the simple optimization and assimilation schemes used in the algorithm.},

Object-based image analysis employing an image object instead of a pixel could help us to meet this need. This paper proposes a segment-based image fusion framework to evaluate the possibility of preparing a multi-scale soil moisture map through integrated Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) data. The results confirmed that the proposed methodology was able to improve soil moisture estimation in different scales up to 20\% better compared to pixel-based fusion approach.},

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) allows for non-invasive soil moisture estimations at the field scale. The derivation of soil moisture generally relies on secondary cosmic-ray neutrons in the epithermal to fast energy ranges. Most approaches and processing techniques for observed neutron intensities are based on the assumption of homogeneous site conditions or of soil moisture patterns with correlation lengths shorter than the measurement footprint of the neutron detector. However, in view of the non-linear relationship between neutron intensities and soil moisture, it is questionable whether these assumptions are applicable. In this study, we investigated how a non-uniform soil moisture distribution within the footprint impacts the CRNS soil moisture estimation and how the combined use of epithermal and thermal neutrons can be advantageous in this case. Thermal neutrons have lower energies and a substantially smaller measurement footprint around the sensor than epithermal neutrons. Analyses using the URANOS (Ultra RApid Neutron-Only Simulation) Monte Carlo simulations to investigate the measurement footprint dynamics at a study site in northeastern Germany revealed that the thermal footprint mainly covers mineral soils in the near-field to the sensor while the epithermal footprint also covers large areas with organic soils. We found that either combining the observed thermal and epithermal neutron intensities by a rescaling method developed in this study or adjusting all parameters of the transfer function leads to an improved calibration against the reference soil moisture measurements in the near-field compared to the standard approach and using epithermal neutrons alone. We also found that the relationship between thermal and epithermal neutrons provided an indicator for footprint heterogeneity. We, therefore, suggest that the combined use of thermal and epithermal neutrons offers the potential of a spatial disaggregation of the measurement footprint in terms of near- and far-field soil moisture dynamics.},

We conducted research to investigate the applicability of a soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system in Cymbidium production for efficient irrigation management and compared the growth and water use of Cymbidium under various substrate conditions. One-year-old Cymbidium `Hoshino Shizuku' plantlets were grown in bark, coconut husk chips, coir dust, or a commercial growing mix at a similar matric potential within the easily available water range. Irrigation occurred when the substrate dried below the volumetric water content thresholds at 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, and 0.40 m(3) m(-3) in the bark, coconut husk chips, coir dust, and the commercial growing mix, respectively. Pseudobulb size, net photosynthetic assimilation rate, fresh shoot, and root weight of the Cymbidium showed no differences among the substrates, although Cymbidium grown in the commercial growing mix had better shoot growth than plants in the other substrates. The amount of irrigation was higher (ca. 6 times) in coarse substrates (bark and coconut husk chips) than fine substrates (coir dust and the commercial growing mix), indicating that fine substrates with higher water-holding capacity could use water more efficiently. The amount of irrigation and nutrient availability of the substrate in the coarse substrates were much lower than those in the fine substrates, producing a difference in growth of the Cymbidium among the substrates. Water use efficiency was 8-9.5 times higher in Cymbidium grown in fine substrates than plants grown in coarse substrates. Overall, the soil moisture sensor-based automated irrigation system could provide an appropriate moisture level for Cymbidium grown in fine substrates, avoiding too wet conditions, and produced quality Cymbidium with more efficient water and nutrient use than orchids produced in coarse substrates.},

	abstract = {Reliable soil moisture retrievals from passive microwave satellite sensors are limited during certain conditions, e.g., snow coverage, radio-frequency interference, and dense vegetation. In these cases, the retrievals can be masked using flagging algorithms. Currently available single- and multi-sensor soil moisture products utilize different flagging approaches. However, a clear overview and comparison of these approaches and their impact on soil moisture data are still lacking. For long-term climate records such as the soil moisture products of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI), the effect of any flagging inconsistency resulting from combining multiple sensor datasets is not yet understood. Therefore, the first objective of this study is to review the data flagging system that is used within multi-sensor ESA CCI soil moisture products as well as the flagging systems of two other soil moisture datasets from sensors that are also used for the ESA CCI soil moisture products: The level 3 Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and the Soil Moisture Active/Passive (SMAP). The SMOS and SMAP soil moisture flagging systems differ substantially in number and type of conditions considered, critical flags, and data source dependencies. The impact on the data availability of the different flagging systems were compared for the SMOS and SMAP soil moisture datasets. Major differences in data availability were observed globally, especially for northern high latitudes, mountainous regions, and equatorial latitudes (up to 37\%, 33\%, and 32\% respectively) with large seasonal variability. These results highlight the importance of a consistent and well-performing approach that is applicable to all individual products used in long-term soil moisture data records. Consequently, the second objective of the present study is to design a consistent and model-independent flagging strategy to improve soil moisture climate records such as the ESA CCI products. As snow cover, ice, and frozen conditions were demonstrated to have the biggest impact on data availability, a uniform satellite driven flagging strategy was designed for these conditions and evaluated against two ground observation networks. The new flagging strategy demonstrated to be a robust flagging alternative when compared to the individual flagging strategies adopted by the SMOS and SMAP soil moisture datasets with a similar performance, but with the applicability to the entire ESA CCI time record without the use of modelled approximations.},

	abstract = {The improvement of water management in agriculture by exactly detecting moisture parameters of soil is crucial. To investigate this problem, a mini inside-out nuclear magnetic resonance sensor (NMR) was proposed to measure moisture parameters of model soils. This sensor combines three cylindrical magnets that are magnetized in the axial direction and three arc spiral coils of the same size in series. We calculated and optimized the magnet structure by equivalent magnetization to current density. By adjusting the radius and height between the cylinders, a circumferential symmetric constant gradient field (2.28 T/m) was obtained. The NMR sensor was set at 2.424 MHz to measure the water content of sandy soil with small particle diameter and silica sand with large particle diameter. The complete decaying, an NMR signal was analyzed through inverse Laplace transformation and averaged on a T-2 space. According to the results, moisture content of the sample is positively correlated with the integral area of T-2 spectrum peak (A(peak)); T-2 of the water in small pores is shorter than that in large pores, because the movement of water molecules are limited by the inner wall of the pores. In the same volume, water in large pore sample is more than that in small pore sample, so A(peak) of silica sand is larger than A(peak) of sandy soil. Therefore, the sensor is capable of detecting moisture both content and pore size of the sample. This mini sensor (4.0 cm in diameter and 10 cm in length) is portable, and the lowest measurable humidity is 0.38\%. Thus, this sensor will allow easy soil moisture measurements on-field in the future.},

The initial data sets were derived from utilizing pyrolysis gas response curves of soil samples acquired from 10 distinct gas sensors. Afterward, we innovatively proposed a sensor array optimization (SAO) method based on the dynamic feature importance (DFI) of the Random Forest-Pearson Correlation Coefficient (RF-PCC) to identify the optimal sensor combinations for four soil nutrients. Furthermore, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and Multilayer Perceptron-Random Forest (MLP-RF) models were employed to predict the soil nutrient content based on the electronic sense to address the challenges associated with developing a unified model. The MLP-RF models showed superior performance compared with the other three models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) for the four soil nutrients ranging from 0.54 to 0.94. Overall, our research not only provides approximately quantitative predictive outcomes but also contributes to a better understanding of a new approach for detecting soil nutrient content.},

Few studies have examined the feasibility of the method using soil moisture for soils with more heterogeneities, which may lead to biased parameters and varied root depths, and thus inaccurate estimates of ETa. We used a genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters most sensitive to ETa estimation, then estimated daily and seasonal ETa using hourly soil moisture data, measured from four sites (from surface to 2-m depth at 20-cm intervals) with different soil textures and crop species in desert-oasis farmlands in northwest China. The seasonal ETa values were 487, 574, 436, and 377 mm at the sites cropped with field maize, spring wheat, seed maize, and seed maize, respectively, in 2018. The daily rates from one site were validated against the eddy-covariance measurements, and the daily rates from all the sites were compared against the estimations from a simple water balance method, and both showed good consistency (R2 = 0.72-0.93). The inverse method has great potential for relatively accurate estimates of ETa in the middle and late growing stages but may induce a slight underestimation in the initial growing season. To determine the minimum monitoring depths of sensors for relatively accurate estimates, ETa values were estimated using soil moisture data at various observation depths, and were compared with eddy-covariance measurements and hypothetical ETa-observed depth curves. The results showed that inaccurate stratification of soil types in the profiles may cause great uncertainty in the estimates, and if texture-contrasting interlayers exist in the profiles, the lowest soil moisture sensor should be placed sufficiently deep, with all the interlayers fully included.},

	abstract = {The existing point-scale or large-scale soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring techniques cannot entirely satisfy the requirements of in situ SMC monitoring for agricultural purposes. We proposed a framework for in situ mesoscale SMC monitoring based on global navigation satellite system interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) and ensemble modeling technique. The framework consists of a data collecting and preparing system and an SMC retrieval system. The amplitude, phase, and detection depth, which are the GNSS-IR signal-to-noise ratio parameters, were positively and negatively correlated with the volumetric SMC data, respectively. In the SMC retrieval stage, five kinds of models including linear regression, multi-linear regression, k-neighbor regressor, support vector regressor, and random forest (RF) was tested as the first-order model. Two kinds of swarm optimization algorithms including sparrow search algorithm (SSA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) were examined for models' hyper-parameter optimization. The results show that the RF performed best and had a coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.798, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.043 cm(3)/cm(3), and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3) for the validation set. Both the SSA and PSO are effective for models' optimization. After input variable selection, the second-order ensemble RF model outperformed the first-order RF model and had an R-2 of 0.819, an RMSE of 0.040 cm(3)/cm(3), and an MAE of 0.031 cm(3)/cm(3) for the validation set. The proposed framework is potentially valuable for popularization because of its cost-effectiveness and high accuracy. (c) 2022 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

Therefore, in this study, we developed a sensor that can simultaneously measure soil water content (theta), electrical conductivity (sigma(b)), temperature, and matric potential (psi). The proposed sensor can determine theta and sigma(b) using time domain transmissiometry and can determine psi based on the capacitance of the accompanying ceramic plate. A series of laboratory and field tests were conducted to evaluate the performance of the sensor. The sensor output values were correlated with the soil properties, and the temperature dependence of the sensor outputs was evaluated. Additionally, field tests were conducted to measure transient soil conditions over a long period. The results show that the developed sensor can measure each soil property with acceptable accuracy. Moreover, the root-mean-square errors of the sensor and reference values were 1.7 for the dielectric constant (which is equivalent to theta), 62 mS m(-1) for sigma(b), and 0.05-0.88 for log psi. The temperature dependence was not a problem, except when psi was below -100 kPa. The sensor can be used for long-term measurements in agricultural fields and exhibited sufficient lifetime and performance. We believe that the developed sensor can contribute to smart agriculture and research on heat and mass transfer in soil.},

In this study, we explore the feasibility and potential of estimating water content in soils and snow with neutron detectors in moving trains. Theoretical considerations quantify the stochastic measurement uncertainty as a function of water content, altitude, resolution, and detector efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the sensitivity of measured water content is almost unperturbed by train materials.

This study examines remotely sensed soil moisture and evapotranspiration data assimilation (DA) with the aim of improving drought monitoring. Although numerous efforts have gone into assimilating satellite soil moisture observations into land surface models to improve their predictive skills, little attention has been given to the combined use of soil moisture and evapotranspiration to better characterize hydrologic fluxes. In this study, we assimilate two remotely sensed datasets, namely, Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) and MODIS evapotranspiration (MODIS16 ET), at 1-km spatial resolution, into the VIC land surface model by means of an evolutionary particle filter method. To achieve this, a fully parallelized framework based on model and domain decomposition using a parallel divide-and-conquer algorithm was implemented. The findings show improvement in soil moisture predictions by multivariate assimilation of both ET and SM as compared to univariate scenarios. In addition, monthly and weekly drought maps are produced using the updated root-zone soil moisture percentiles over the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint basin in the southeastern United States. The model-based estimates are then compared against the corresponding U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM) archive maps. The results are consistent with the USDM maps during the winter and spring season considering the drought extents; however, the drought severity was found to be slightly higher according to DA method. Comparing different assimilation scenarios showed that ET assimilation results in wetter conditions comparing to open-loop and univariate SM DA. The multivariate DA then combines the effects of the two variables and provides an in-between condition.},

	abstract = {To address limitations in regional-scale applications of passive microwave remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products, various downscaling methods have been proposed to enhance the spatial resolution of SM. Nonetheless, these downscaled methods, which are based on optical and thermal infrared data, face challenges in vegetated areas and are prone to inaccuracies due to cloud cover affecting ancillary data. In response to these challenges, we introduced a novel approach termed the vegetation-temperature-radiation-composite (VTRC) method. This method recognizes the robust interaction between vegetation and SM and also appreciates the high sensitivity of surface temperature variation to surface net solar radiation (SSR) in relation to SM. Besides, the VTRC method combines ERA5 data with its high temporal resolution and MODIS data to counteract data loss due to cloud coverage. Applied to downscale the ESA CCI SM products from 0.25 degrees to 0.01 degrees spatial resolution, the VTRC method is validated over Castilla y Leon (Spain) and Anhui province (China). The VTRC method demonstrates a significant improvement compared to the feature space-based downscaled method and the original ESA CCI products, achieving higher correlation coefficient ( {\textbackslash}R{\textbackslash} ) of 0.56 and 0.66 {\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{m\}{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}\{3\}/{\textbackslash}textbackslashtext\{m\}{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}\{ 3\}{\textbackslash} in humid and semi-arid regions with ground observations, respectively.

Additionally, the inclusion of vegetation information notably improves the accuracy in comparison to solely using land surface temperature (LST) and SSR.

	abstract = {The instrumental monitoring of torrential catchments is a fundamental research task that provides necessary information to improve our understanding of the mechanisms of debris flows. While most monitoring sites include meteorological sensors and analyze the critical rainfall conditions, very few contain soil moisture measurements. In our monitoring site, the Rebaixader catchment, 11 debris flows and 24 debris floods were detected during the last 9 years. Herein, the initiation mechanisms of these torrential flows were analyzed, focusing on the critical rainfall conditions and the soil water dynamics. Comparing the temporal distribution of both rainfall episodes and torrential flows, the Kernel density plots showed maximum values for rainfalls at the beginning of June, while the peak for torrential flows is on July 20. Thus, the antecedent rainfall, and especially the soil moisture conditions, may influence the triggering of torrential flows. In a second step, a new updated rainfall threshold was proposed that included total rainfall duration and mean intensity. The analysis of soil moisture data was more complicated, and no clear trends were observed in the data set. Therefore, additional data have to be recorded in order to quantitatively analyze the role of soil moisture on the triggering of torrential flows and for the definition of thresholds. Some preliminary results show that the soil moisture at the beginning of a rainfall event affects the maximum increase of soil moisture, while a slight trend was visible comparing the initial soil moisture with the necessary rainfall amount to trigger a torrential flow.},

This study aimed to explore the feasibility of accurately estimating soil moisture content at a regional scale by combining ground hyper-spectral data with multispectral remote sensing (Sentinel-2) data. The results showed that the different mathematical transformations increased the correlation between soil spectral reflectance and SMC to varying degrees. Hyper-spectral optimized index normalized difference index (NDI) ((B-769 similar to 797 - B-848 similar to 881/B-769 similar to 797 + B-848 similar to 881); (B-842 - B-740/B-842 + B-740)) derived from the transformed reflectance (the first-order derivate of reciprocal-logarithm (Log (1/R))', second-order derivate of reciprocal-logarithm (Log (1/R)) `') showed significant correlation (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.61; r = 0.47) with SMC, and the correlation coefficient values higher than difference index (DI) and ratio index (RI).

When verifying the accuracy, the model yields R-2 values of 0.619 and 0.701. These results indicated that the two-band hyper-spectral optimized indices (NDI) as an optimal indicator for quickly and accurately soil moisture content estimation.

	abstract = {The accurate estimation of plant water needs is the first step for achieving high crop water productivity. The main objective of the work was to develop an irrigation scheduling procedure for mandarin orchards under Mediterranean conditions based on replacing the amount of consumed water using reference values of soil moisture according to different phenological periods. The proposed methodology includes a definition part where the threshold values were established relating the trees' stem water potential and the volumetric soil water content measured with Frequency Domain Reflectometry probes. A second part includes the steps for standardizing measurements from capacitance probes by using the LEACHM hydrological simulation model to take into account the sensor-to-sensor variations. Finally, an extrapolation procedure based on soil water retention curves was used for adapting critical soil water content thresholds to different soil conditions. Field evaluations were made in a citrus orchard located in eastern Spain during two seasons. Standardize critical soil water contents were: i) 24 \% vol. for post-harvest, bloom - fruit set and phase III of fruit growth; ii) 27 \% vol. for phase I of fruit growth, and iii) 29 \% vol. for phase II of fruit growth with average daily air vapour pressure deficit values ranging between 0.2 - 0.4; 0.9-1.1 and 1.1-1.3 kPa, respectively. When implemented in the orchard, the sensor-based strategy resulted in water saving of 26 \% respect to a control treatment, irrigated using the standard FAO-56 approach, without significant differences in yield and increasing the crop water productivity by 33 \%. In conclusion, we suggest that the determination and use of the critical soil water content is a useful tool for scheduling irrigation. The proposed standardization and extrapolation methodology allows the irrigation strategy to be applied to other mandarin orchards under similar climatic conditions.},

An experiment was designed where environmental settings are more controlled, the best outside laboratory, to assess the transferability from lab to outdoor. A field experiment was carried out to evaluate the use of electric resistivity tomography (ERT) for monitoring soil moisture dynamics over a period of 67 days. A homogeneous site in the central part of The Netherlands was selected consisting of grass pasture on an aeolian sand soil profile. ERT values were correlated to gravimetric soil moisture samples for five depths at three different dates. Correlations ranged from 0.43 to 0.73 and were best for a soil depth of 90 cm. Resistivity patterns over time (time-lapse ERT) were analyzed and related to rainfall events where rainfall infiltration patterns could be identified. Duplicate ERT measurements showed that the noise level of the instrument and measurements is low and generally below 3\% for the soil profile below the mixed layer but above the groundwater. Although the majority of the measured resistivity patterns could be well explained, some artefacts and dynamics were more difficult to clarify, even so in this homogeneous field situation. The presence of an oak tree with its root structure and a ditch with surface water with higher conductivity may have an impact on the resistivity pattern in the soil profile and over time. We conclude that ERT allows for detailed spatial measurement of local soil moisture dynamics resulting from precipitation although field experiments do not yield accuracies similar to laboratory experiments. ERT approaches are suitable for detailed spatial analyses where probe or sample-based methods are limited in reach or repeatability.},

	abstract = {Downscaling of passive microwave derived soil moisture (SM) using thermal-infrared remote sensing data is a common method to obtain higher resolution SM information. However, these thermal-based downscaling methods are limited by their requirement of daily reparameterization because thermal-infrared data are influenced by both the SM content and weather conditions. To overcome these limitations, this study developed a new method called downscaling method based on optical trapezoid model (DespiTe), which improves the spatial resolution of passive microwave derived SM products by using only optical remote sensing data. This method relies on the linear relationship between SM and the shortwave-infrared transformed (STR) reflectance, which is less affected by weather conditions. Thus, the DespiTe method needs to be parameterized only once for each area. By establishing statistical relationships between optical parameters (normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and STR) and passive microwave derived SM observations, the DespiTe method enables a higher spatial resolution SM estimation to be derived. The downscaling results from DespiTe were evaluated with aircraft and in situ observed SM data acquired during the SMAPEx-4 and SMAPVEX16 field experiments. Moreover, these results were compared with those from disaggregation based on physical and theoretical scale change (DisPATCh), a commonly used thermal-based downscaling method. A comparison against aircraft SM data showed that the DespiTe method achieved an unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of 0.026 m(3)/m(3), which outperformed the DisPATCh method that achieved a ubRMSE of 0.059 m(3)/m(3).},

	abstract = {Soil moisture in the root zone is the most important factor in eco-hydrological processes. Even though soil moisture can be obtained by remote sensing, limited to the top few centimeters ({\textless} 5 cm). Researchers have attempted to estimate root-zone soil moisture using multiple regression, data assimilation, and data-driven methods. However, correlations between root-zone soil moisture and its related variables, including surface soil moisture, always appear nonlinear, which is difficult to extract and express using typical statistical methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) method, which is advantageous for nonlinear relationship analysis and extraction is applied for root-zone soil moisture estimation, but by only considering its separate temporal or spatial correlations. The convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model, known to capture spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale sequential datasets with the advantage of dealing with spatiotemporal sequence forecasting problem, was used in this study to estimate root-zone soil moisture based on remote sensing-based variables. Owing to limitation of regional soil moisture observation data, the physical model Hydrus-1D was used to generate large and spatiotemporal vertical soil moisture dataset for the ConvLSTM model training and verification. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) etc. remote sensing-based factors were selected as predictive variables. Results of the ConvLSTM model showed that the fitting coefficients (R-2) of the root-zone soil moisture estimation significantly increased compared to those achieved by Global Land Data Assimilation System products, especially for deep layers. For example, R-2 increased from 0.02 to 0.60 at depth of 40 cm. This study suggests that a combination of the physical model and AI is a flexible tool capable of predicting spatiotemporally continuous root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy on a large scale.},

So far, EMI has mainly been used for homogenous soil conditions, which are not common in agriculture and results are mainly validated by excavated pits or calibration models using soil samples on a transect. This study converts apparent electrical conductivity data recorded with a Dualem-1Hs EM-metre for two surveys of variable moisture conditions (dry and wet season) with 2475 and 2174 data points over 5.4 ha, in a field with a contrasting vertical soil profile into spatiotemporal management zones. A least square inversion algorithm was used to determine electrical conductivities for individual soil layers of 0-0.5 m, 0.5-0.8 m and 0.8-1.6 m. Soil samples from the depth of 0.5 m and 0.8 m were used for soil moisture calibrations. A laboratory experiment under controlled conditions developed electric conductivity vs volumetric water content relations with power law functions for required soil depth slices with R 2 values between 0.98 and 0.99. Subsequently, EMI data were converted to volumetric water contents for each layer and predictions were spatially displayed. Median change between the measured apparent conductivity and inverted values range from 6 to 17 mS m(-1) resulting in 3-7\% difference in volumetric water prediction. These EMI based soil moisture predictions were compared with neutron moisture metre measurements, with Pearson R values of 0.74 and 0.95 for the wet and dry season surveys, respectively. The method is robust and offers a comparatively fast method to estimate the soil moisture status in fields and subsequently make informed management decisions.},

Focusing on the fact that water content and conductivity depend on soil impedance, our group has been developing a new compact and noise-resistant driving circuit that measured soil impedance by detecting transient characteristics of the voltage obtained by injecting current through the soil and converting it to frequency information. In order to realize agricultural field measurements with sensors using this new driving circuit, it had been necessary to miniaturize the part that detected the output from the driving circuit, but it hadn't been achieved in our previous work. In this research, a microcomputer-based frequency counter was developed to downsize the system for on-site measurement. In general, there are two methods of frequency measurement: direct counting and reciprocal. The direct-counting method is suited for high-frequency measurements, while the reciprocal method is suited for low-frequency measurements. The developed frequency counter could measure with an error of 0.005\% over the assumed frequency range by switching between those two measurement methods according to the measured frequency. Using this driving circuit and frequency counter, we measured the model soil and succeeded in capturing changes in water content as changes in impedance.},

A user interface and a sampling process (use of citizen science by subscribers) were designed to analyze the subjective and gravimetric soil moisture data. Furthermore, explanatory moisture condition (EMC), a new initiative to consider land use in soil moisture information from vegetation cover, was evaluated. A statistical artificial neural network was used for quantifying subjective data, and soil moisture layouts were produced by utilizing the ordinary kriging (OK) method. For cross-validating, the land surface temperature data from the MODIS satellite were retrieved. A platform for the region with 200 m grids resolution to collect daily soil moisture at eight ungauged stations is proposed to utilize subjective data from the subscribers and cross-validated with satellite data. A virtual station at the centroid of the pervious part of the study area was selected as a reference station for data collection daily or weekly to generate soil moisture time series.

	abstract = {Relative to other geophysical variables, soil moisture (SM) estimates derived from land surface models (LSMs) and land data assimilation systems (LDAS) are difficult to transfer between platforms and applications. This difficulty stems from the highly model-dependent nature of LSM SM estimates and differences in the vertical support of discretized SM values. As a result, operational SM estimates generated by one LSM (or LDAS) cannot generally be directly applied to a hydrologic monitoring or forecast system designed around a second LSM. This lack of transferability is particularly problematic for LDAS applications, where the time, expertise, and computational resources required to generate an operational LDAS analysis cannot be practically duplicated for every LSM-specific application. Here, we develop a set of simple regression tools for translating SMestimates between LSMs andmultiple LDAS analyses. Results demonstrate that simple multivariate linear regression-utilizing independent variables based on multilayer and temporally lagged SM estimates-can significantly improve upon baseline transformation approaches using direct percentile matching. The proposed regression approaches are effective for both the LSM-to-LSM and LDAS-to-LDAS transformation of multilayer SM percentiles. Application of this approach will expand the utility of existing, high-quality (but LSM-specific) operational sources of SM information like the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-4 Soil Moisture product.},

Here, the LAGRS model, which is totally oriented for GNOS-R, is employed to estimate vegetation and surface roughness effects on surface reflectivity. Since the LAGRS (land surface GNSS reflection simulator) model is a space-borne GNSS-R (GNSS reflectometry) simulator based on the microwave radiative transfer equation model, the method presented in this paper takes more consideration on the physical scattering properties for retrieval. Ancillary information from SMAP (soil moisture active passive) such as the vegetation water content and the roughness coefficient are investigated for the final algorithm's development. At first, the SR (surface reflectivity) data calculated from GNOS-R is calculated and then calibrated, and then the vegetation roughness factor is achieved and used to eliminate the effects on both factors. After receiving the Fresnel reflectivity, the corresponding soil moisture estimated from this method is retrieved. The results demonstrate good consistency between soil moisture derived from GNOS-R data and SMAP soil moisture, with a correlation coefficient of 0.9599 and a root mean square error of 0.0483 cm(3)/cm(3). This method succeeds in providing soil moisture on a global scale and is based on the previously developed physical LAGRS model. In this way, the great potential of GNOS-R for soil moisture estimation is presented.},

	abstract = {The distributed unit hydrograph (DUH) method has been widely used for flow routing in a watershed because it adequately characterizes the underlying surface characteristics and varying rainfall intensity. Fundamental to the calculation of DUH is flow velocity. However, the currently used velocity formula assumes a global equilibrium of the watershed and ignores the impact of time-varying soil moisture content on flow velocity, which thus leads to a larger flow velocity. The objective of this study was to identify a soil moisture content factor, which, based on the tension water storage capacity curve, was derived to investigate the response of DUH to soil moisture content in unsaturated areas. Thus, an improved distributed unit hydrograph, based on time-varying soil moisture content, was obtained. The proposed DUH considered the impact of both time-varying rainfall intensity and soil moisture content on flow velocity, assuming the watershed to be not in equilibrium but varying with soil moisture. The Qin River basin and Longhu River basin were selected as two case studies, and the synthetic unit hydrograph (SUH), the time-varying distributed unit hydrograph (TDUH) and the current DUH methods were compared with the proposed method. Then, the influence of time-varying soil moisture content on flow velocity and flow routing was evaluated, and results showed that the proposed method performed the best among the four methods. The shape and duration of the unit hydrograph (UH) were mainly related to the soil moisture content at the initial stage of a rainstorm, and when the watershed was approximately saturated, the grid flow velocity was mainly dominated by excess rainfall. The proposed method can be used for the watersheds with sparse gauging stations and limited observed rainfall and runoff data.},

	abstract = {The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Soil Moisture Active-Passive (SMAP) mission characterizes global spatiotemporal patterns in surface soil moisture using dual L-band microwave retrievals of horizontal (T-Bh) and vertical (T-B(v)) polarized microwave brightness temperatures through a modeled mechanistic relationship between vegetation opacity, surface scattering albedo, and soil effective temperature (T-eff). Although this model has been validated against in situ soil moisture, there is a lack of systematic characterization of where and why SMAP estimates deviate from the in situ observations. Here, we assess how the information content of in situ soil moisture observations from the US Climate Reference Network contrasts with (1) the information contained within raw SMAP observations (i.e., “informational random uncertainty”) derived from T-Bh, T-B(v), and T-eff themselves and with (2) the information contained in SMAP's dual-channel algorithm (DCA) soil moisture estimates (i.e., “informational model uncertainty”) derived from the model's inherent structure and parameterizations. The results show that, on average, 80 \% of the information in the in situ soil moisture is unexplained by SMAP DCA soil moisture estimates. Loss of information in the DCA modeling process contributes 35 \% of the unexplained information, while the remainder is induced by a lack of additional explanatory power within T-Bh, T-B(v), and T-eff. Overall, retrieval quality of SMAP DCA soil moisture, denoted as the Pearson correlation coefficient between SMAP DCA soil moisture and in situ soil moisture, is negatively correlated with the informational uncertainties, with slight differences across different land covers. The informational model uncertainty (Pearson correlation of -0.59) was found to be more influential than the informational random uncertainty (Pearson correlation of -0.34), suggesting that the poor performance of SMAP DCA at some locations is driven by model parameterization and/or structure and not underlying satellite measurements of T-Bh and T-B(v). A decomposition of mutual information between T-Bh, T-B(v), and DCA soil moisture shows that on average 58 \% of information provided by T-Bh and T-B(v) to DCA estimates is redundant. The amount of information redundantly and synergistically provided by T-Bh and T-Bv, was found to be closely related (Pearson correlations of 0.79 and -0.82, respectively) to the retrieval quality of SMAP DCA. T-Bh and T-Bv tend to contribute large redundant information to DCA estimates under surfaces or conditions where DCA makes better retrievals. This study provides a baseline approach that can also be applied to evaluate other remote sensing models and understand informational loss as satellite retrievals are translated to end-user products.},

The spatial resolution of available soil moisture products is generally coarser than 25 km, which limits their hydro-meteorological and eco-hydrological applications and the management of water resources at watershed and agricultural scales. A feasible solution to overcome these limitations is to downscale coarse soil moisture products with the support of higher-resolution spatial information. Although many auxiliary variables have been used for this purpose, few studies have analyzed their applicability and effectiveness in arid regions. To this end, we comprehensively evaluated four commonly used auxiliary variables, including NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), LST (Land Surface Temperature), TVDI (Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index), and SEE (Soil Evaporative Efficiency), against ground-based soil moisture observations during the vegetation growing season in the Heihe River Basin, China. Performance metrics indicated that SEE is most sensitive (R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.67) to soil moisture because it is controlled by soil evaporation limited by the available soil moisture. The similarity of spatial patterns also showed that SEE best captures soil moisture changes, with the STD (standard deviation) of the HD (Hausdorff Distance) less than 0.058 when compared with PLMR (Polarimetric L-band Multi-beam Radiometer) soil moisture products. In addition, soil moisture was mapped by RF (Random Forests) using both single auxiliary variables and 11 types of multiple auxiliary variable combinations. SEE was found to be the best auxiliary variable for scaling and mapping soil moisture with accuracy of 0.035 cm(3)/cm(3). Among the multiple auxiliary variables, the combination of LST, NDVI, and SEE was found to best enhance the scaling and mapping accuracy of soil moisture with 0.034 cm(3)/cm(3).},

This results in a significant limitation in studying dynamic coupled earth system processes such as surface and subsurface hydrology from a single compact instrument, where co-located broad spectrum radar remote sensing is needed to sense multiple variables simultaneously or over a short duration. Rydberg atomic sensors are highly sensitive broad-spectrum quantum detectors that can be dynamically tuned to cover micro-to-millimeter waves with no requirement for RF band-specific electronics. Rydberg atomic sensors can use existing transmitted signals such as from navigation and communication satellites to enable remote sensing. We demonstrate remote sensing of soil moisture, an important earth system variable, via ground-based radar reflectometry with Rydberg atomic systems. To do this, we sensitize the atoms to XM satellite radio signals and use signal correlations to demonstrate use of these satellite signals for remote sensing of soil moisture.},

Remote sensing techniques can provide soil moisture in a large-scale range, but they can only provide surface soil moisture (SSM) with a depth of approximately 5-10 cm. In order to obtain a large range of soil moisture for deeper soil layers, especially the crop root zone with a depth of about 100-200 cm, numerous methods based on remote sensing inversion have been proposed. This paper analyzes and summarizes the research progress of remote sensing-based RZSM estimation methods in the past few decades and classifies these methods into four categories: empirical methods, semi-empirical methods, physics-based methods, and machine learning methods.

First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning methods-classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient, temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy, with root mean square error values of 1.87\% and 1.64\%, respectively. The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for land desertification studies and ecological environment management in the study region.},

Hence, it is important to assess new methods to quantify these environmental variables. In this work, we propose a new method to determine groundwater evaporation rates by combining the actively heated fiber-optic (AHFO) method with vadose zone modeling, assuming that the evaporation front remains at the soil surface. In our study, the AHFO method yielded estimates of the soil moisture (theta) profile with a spatial resolution of similar to 6.5 mm and with an error of 0.026 m(3) m(-3). The numerical model resulted in a slightly different theta profile than that measured, where the largest differences occurred at the soil surface. Sensitivity and uncertainty analyses highlighted that a better precision is required when determining the soil hydraulic parameters. To improve the proposed method, the soil heat-vapor-water dynamics should be included and the assumption that the evaporation front remains at the soil surface must be relaxed. Additionally, if the AHFO calibration curve is enhanced, the errors of the estimated theta profile can be reduced and thus, successful estimation of the evaporation rates for a wider range of soil textures can be achieved. The spatial scales measured are an important advantage of the proposed method that should be further explored to improve the analysis presented here.},

In response, we conducted a robust three-year field validation study at a well-instrumented agricultural site in Nebraska, United States. The study involved 27 gravimetric water content sampling campaigns in maize and soybean and 40K specific activity (Bq kg-1) measurements from a stationary GRS sensor. Our analysis showed that the current method for biomass water content correction is appropriate for our maize and soybean field but that the ratio of soil mass attenuation to water mass attenuation used in the theoretical equation must be adjusted to satisfactorily describe the field data. We propose a calibration equation with two free parameters: the theoretical 40K intensity in dry soil and a, which creates an “effective” mass attenuation ratio. Based on statistical analyses of our data set, we recommend calibrating the GRS sensor for SWC estimation using 10 profiles within the footprint and 5 calibration sampling campaigns to achieve a cross-validation root mean square error below 0.035 g g-1.},

Overall, these 90 m resolution predictions improve on the performance of NASA-USDA SMAP (10 km resolution) and the Australian Landscape Water Balance (5 km resolution) simulated soil water contents. Land use/land cover (LULC) are important explaining factors for performance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) indicate high impor-tance of NASA-USDA SMAP for surface predictions, while soil properties and LULC increase in importance with depth.},

	abstract = {Evaluating the long-term spatiotemporal variability in soil moisture (SM) over Africa is crucial for understanding how crop production is affected by drought or flooding. However, the lack of continuous and stable long-term series and high-resolution soil moisture records impedes such research. To overcome the inconsistency of different microwave sensors (Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS, AMSR-E; Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, SMOS; and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2, AMSR2) in measuring soil moisture over time and depth, we built a time series reconstruction model to correct SM, and then used a Spatially Weighted Downscaling Model to downscale the SM data from three different sensors to a 1 km spatial resolution. The verification of the reconstructed data shows that the product has high accuracy, and can be used for application and analysis. The spatiotemporal trends of SM in Africa were examined for 2003-2017. The analysis indicated that soil moisture is declining in Africa as a whole, and it is notably higher in central Africa than in other subregions. The most significant decrease in SM was observed in the savanna zone (slope {\textless} -0.08 m(3) m(-3) and P {\textless} 0.001), followed by South Africa and Namibia (slope {\textless} -0.07 m(3) m(-3) and P {\textless} 0.01). Seasonally, the most significant downward trends in SM were observed during the spring, mainly over eastern and central Africa (slope {\textless} -0.07 m(3) m(-3), R {\textless} -0.58 and P {\textless} 0.001). The analysis of spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture can help improve the understanding of hydrological cycles, and provide benchmark information for drought management in Africa.},

The lower limit or “breaking point “ is determined following the soil water content dynamics on the transition of a rapid rate of depletion to a slower, under similar reference evapotranspiration. Although this criterion is practical, its implementation should be validated with plant water status measurement that contemplate weather condition, such as stem water potential “non-stressed “ baseline (Tx as a function of vapor-pressure deficit (VPD) in Ow conditions that do not limit yield). A study was con-ducted on a mature cv. `Hass' avocado orchard in Central Chile during two seasons. There were 5 irrigation treatments: T1, Control; T2 and T3 with 29\% less and 25\% more of what was applied in T1, respectively; T4 and T5 same as Control until first and second fruit drop abscission, respectively, and then with 29\% less. T1 trees were irrigated using a continuous frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) probe to maintain the root zone be-tween field capacity and the breaking point. There was biweekly monitoring of the Ow prior to irrigation, Tx and VPD. The Tx decline proportional to the intensity and the timing of water restriction; however, no treatment affected the crop load in either season. T2 did not show significant detrimental in fruit size, production and maturation, despite that frequently reached water content levels at the limit of the breaking point, and showed lower levels of stem water potential than Control, being the treatment with the highest water productivity. The results confirm that breaking point is an effective criterion to establish irrigation management. Additionally, when comparing the baseline for our non-stressed trees with a baseline from full irrigation treatments obtained from the literature, 30\% water savings were achieved.},

The hydrological model HYDRUS-1D is coupled with the crop growth model WOFOST, and the Ensemble Kalman Filter is used to assimilate Sentinel-1 inversion soil moisture data. According to the precision and continuity of soil moisture, the damage of winter wheat waterlogging were obtained. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the soil moisture is improved after data assimilation compared with that before data assimilation, and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of the simulated soil moisture values at three monitoring sites increased from 0.528, 0.541 and 0.575 to 0.752, 0.692 and 0.731, respectively. A new waterlogging identification criterion has been proposed based on the growth periods and probability distribution of soil moisture. The proportion, calculated from this identification criterion, of the waterlogging wheat farmland in total farmland shows a high correlation with the yield reduction rate. The correlation coefficient of the waterlogging farmland proportion and the yield reduction rate in 11 towns of Guzhen County reaches 0.78. Through the synchronization of geography, agriculture and meteorology, the framework shows great potential in waterlogging monitoring.},

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is one of the few techniques that can directly acquire information about the temporal dynamics of soil water content (SWC) at a hectometer scale. The performance of CRNS depends on the climate, soil and conditions of the underlying surface. The region of red soil in China is characterized by heterogeneous land uses (combination of upland and paddy fields), distinct dry-wet periods and low contents of soil organic carbon. The applicability of CRNS has not yet been evaluated under the subtropical hydroclimatic conditions of this region. We therefore compared spatially averaged SWC measured using CRNS with point-scale data measured using time domain reflectometry (TDR) at five locations and oven-dried soil samples collected at 27 locations across the CRNS footprint in an agricultural ecosystem of the red-soil region between March 2019 and February 2020. The footprint of CRNS varied with time. The horizontal radius of CRNS varied between 175 m in July and 215 m in October, with a mean of 194 m, and the measuring depth varied between 16 cm in March and 23 cm in August, with a mean of 19 cm. The relative contribution of rainfed cropland, citrus land and paddy fields were 86.7, 10.7 and 2.6\%, respectively. The differences of the relative contribution among land uses were determined by the distance to the sensor and the area, which were less affected by the types of land use. The neutron count rate (N-0, counts/h) was weakly temporally variable, with a mean coefficient of variation of 3\%. The influence of its variation on the accuracy of CRNS, however, should not be ignored. Both the timing and frequency of sampling affected the calculation of N-0. Occasional sampling in the dry season is a recommended strategy to acquire an accurate N-0 of a region. CRNS performed well for determining the dynamics of spatially averaged SWC in heterogeneous landscapes. More specifically, the accuracy of CRNS was comparable with those using the oven-drying method, with R-2, root mean square error and Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient of 0.86, 0.026 cm(3)/cm(3) and 0.81, respectively. This study evaluated the applicability of CRNS in a region with complex climatic, hydrological and underlying-surface conditions. These results are useful for developing a reasonable sampling strategy for acquiring an accurate N-0 and calibrating the CRNS. Future studies, however, should focus on the application of the CRNS technique to resolve the eco-environmental issues of the region.},

	volume = {168},
	isbn = {978-0-12-824589-7},
	abstract = {Recommendations for nitrogen (N) fertilization are based on the analysis of the soil mineral N (SMN) content of one composite sample that is assumed to represent the average concentration, but that almost by definition fails to properly represent the inherent spatial variability of the field. Improvement in N management can thus be achieved by high-resolution measurements of the soil N status. However, soil sampling, transportation, sample preparation and laboratory analysis are laborious, costly and time-consuming. Additionally, errors associated with all these steps (particularly sampling and sample preparation) are notorious sources of inaccuracy. In situ and on-line measurement modes could overcome these drawbacks. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of proximal soil sensing technologies for in situ and on-line measurements of total nitrogen (TN) and mineral N in soils. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy (vis-NIRS) and mid-infrared spectroscopy (MIRS) have been successfully used in in situ and on-line measurement platforms for determining TN. The review also focuses on data fusion (DF) approaches not only to improve the prediction performance of TN by vis-NIRS and MIRS but also to delineate management zones for site-specific N management. Electrochemical sensors such as ion-selective electrodes (ISE) or ion-selective field-effect transistors (ISFET) were found to be the most suitable to measure SMN. However, it was found that both sensor technologies are difficult to use for on-line measurements because they require the preparation of a soil solution and sufficient time delay is needed to reach a stable plateau. These limitations restrict the implementation of electrochemical sensing tools for site-specific N management, although they are the best methods to measure SMN, a needed parameter as a direct measure to determine N recommendations. Research on proximal soil sensing (PSS) for N measurement in soils should focus on the development of robust and accurate in situ and on-line sensors for SMN, whereas improvement in the performance of vis-NIRS and MIRS for TN prediction by using advanced modelling and DF techniques is recommended. This development is essential to promote the implementation of variable rate N fertilization (VRNF). The review suggested the fusion of on-line collected soil data with crop data, present and historical yield, topography and weather conditions as the optimal solution for map-based and sensor-based VRNF scenarios. Furthermore, a new approach for VRNF, designated as the map-sensor-based approach, is proposed. In this approach, management zones (MZ) maps for the soil is developed in advance at the beginning of the cropping season, and this information is combined with current crop growth status [e.g., normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI)], measured with a proximal crop sensor to calculate the recommendation and implement VRNF in real-time.},

	abstract = {The conventional methods of estimating soil water content (SWC) are mainly based on in situ measurements at sampling points and remote sensing measurements over an entire region. In view of these methods, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has received increasing attention in recent years as a mesoscale, noncontact SWC estimation technology that can provide more accurate and timely estimates of SWC over a larger area. In this study, we estimated SWC using both CRNS and soil-mounted detectors in farmland and mountainous areas, and evaluated the accuracy of the estimations at two experimental sites. Ultra-rapid adaptable neutron-only simulation (URANOS) was used to simulate the detection radius and depth of the two experimental sites and to obtain the spatial weights of the CRNS footprint. The results show that the theoretical range of detection was reduced in farmland compared to mountainous areas during the experimental period, suggesting that farmland retained more SWC even with less precipitation. Spatial weights were simulated to calculate the SWC of sampling points, and the weighted and averaged SWC were then correlated with CRNS. The weighting calculation improves the accuracy of CRNS estimations, with a determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.645 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046 cm(3)center dot cm(-3) for farmland, and reproduces the daily dynamics of SWC. The R-2 and RMSE in mountainous areas are 0.773 and 0.049 cm(3)center dot cm(-3), respectively, and the estimation accuracy of CRNS cannot be improved by the weighting calculation. The estimation accuracy of CRNS is acceptable in both regions, but the mountainous terrain obstructs neutron transmission, causing a deviation between the actual and theoretical neutron footprints in mountainous areas. Thus, the accuracy of SWC estimation is limited in mountainous terrain. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that CRNS is suitable for use in farmland and mountainous areas and that further attention should be given to the effects of topography and vegetation when it is applied in mountainous environments.},

Data assimilation has proven to be a promising technique for improving soil moisture estimation, and various studies have been conducted on soil moisture data assimilation based on land surface models. However, crop growth models, which are ideal tools for agricultural simulation applications, are rarely used for soil moisture assimilation. Moreover, the role of data assimilation in agricultural drought monitoring is seldom investigated. In the present work, we assimilated the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) soil moisture product into the Decision Support System for Agro-technology Transfer (DSSAT) model to estimate surface and root-zone soil moisture, and we evaluated the effect of data assimilation on agricultural drought monitoring. The results demonstrate that the soil moisture estimates were significantly improved after data assimilation. Root-zone soil moisture had a better agreement with in situ observation. Compared with the drought index based on soil moisture modeled without remotely-sensed observations, the drought index based on assimilated data could improve at least one drought level in agricultural drought monitoring and performed better when compared with winter wheat yield. In conclusion, crop growth model-based data assimilation effectively improves the soil moisture estimation and further strengthens soil moisture-based drought indices for agricultural drought monitoring.},

Image processing technology (image greyscale and image similarity comparison) was employed to determine the image algorithm suitable for contour map pre-processing and the best time period for VSWC monitoring. These results indicated that the contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) greyscale algorithm is a suitable pre-processing algorithm for processing contour maps using image processing technology, and the best 5TE sensor data monitoring time period is every 10 h.

Lightweight optical and thermal sensors have been used widely on UAVs for a range of applications, and have been proposed by some as the best approach to map soil moisture at farm scales.

Accordingly, it is postulated that this will also be the best technique for UAV-based near-surface soil moisture remote sensing, overcoming the spatial resolution limitation from low earth orbit altitude. Being so far limited by sensor availability, only a small number of studies have illustrated the potential of UAV-based near-surface soil moisture mapping using L-band microwave radiometers, and there has been no direct comparison with the thermal-optical alternative. To guide the design of future UAV-based soil moisture mapping systems, airborne optical, thermal infrared, and passive microwave observations collected from a scientific aircraft at low altitude over a center-pivot irrigation farm in Tasmania, Australia were used in this study to simulate UAV-based observations, and the performances of the thermal-optical and microwave techniques when compared at 75 m scale. The L-band microwave emission showed a superior sensitivity to near-surface soil moisture, and a higher and more consistent soil moisture retrieval accuracy than thermal-optical, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.05-0.06 m(3)/m(3) and 0.05-0.09 m(3)/m(3), respectively.},

Universal multiple linear regression (uMLR) is a simple machine learning tool that analyzes the relationship between all possible subsets of observations and the prediction of interest. This study used uMLR and volumetric water content data (VWC) taken from maize field experiments at the Limited Irrigation Research Farm near Greeley, Colorado, to optimize the number and placement of soil moisture sensors to characterize the entire soil water deficit (SWD) in the root zone. The uMLR analysis quantified the accuracy of using one or two VWC measurements to represent SWD. We evaluated seven field seasons, with 12 treatments and four replicates of each, where volumetric VWC was typically measured one to three times weekly. Results indicate that the best single sensor depth is at 30 cm, and the best combination of two sensors is at 0 to 15 cm and 60 cm. To validate the experiment, a continuous VWC sensor was used at 30 cm to predict SWD results with acceptable accuracy (RMSE = 4.60 mm). This study suggests that in the sandy loam site evaluated and with varying irrigation levels, soil moisture sensor placement near the soil surface along with knowledge of soil texture can be used to characterize SWD. This technique may be transferable to other locations and soils and shows potential for optimizing irrigation management via soil moisture sensor networks with continuous SWD data.},

This study investigated the usefulness of integrating canopy sensing tools and soil N content to estimate grain yield and N requirement at various corn development stages. Six to seven N rates at 35-45 kg urea-N ha(-1) increments were pre-plant applied in 12 sites throughout Minnesota. Canopy-sensing measurements were obtained at the V4, V8, V12, and R1 stages. Soil (0-30 and 0-60 cm) NH4-N and NO3-N concentrations were measured at the V4, V8, and V12 stages. Adjusting sensor measurements with soil NO3-N (0-30 cm) measured at the V4 stage provided the best trade-off between gains in prediction accuracy and practicality for soil sampling. At the V4 stage, predictions of N requirement with soil N alone (RMSE = 41.3 kg N ha(-1)) and soil-N-adjusted sensor measurements (RMSE ranging from 39.6 to 42.7 kg N ha(-1)) were similar but better than predictions with unadjusted sensor measurements (RMSE ranging from 61.0 to 72.9 kg N ha(-1)). Although the utility of canopy sensing without soil-N adjustments improved at later development stages, the most accurate predictions of N requirement were obtained with soil-N-adjusted sensor measurements collected at V8 and V12 (RMSE as low as 32.5 kg N ha(-1)). Our study shows that early-season canopy sensing (up to V8) coupled with soil N measurements may be a viable alternative to improve in-season N management.},

The pairwise comparison matrix based ranking of parameters and giving weights was carried out considering the importance of each parameter for specific crops. The total area, being under the major rice-potato belt, could be classified from the suitability view point to the `highly suitable'(S-1) class occupying 29.2\%, and `not suitable' (N) class; 4.5\% for rice, about 6.5\% of land is `highly suitable' (S-1), `and nearly 2.1\% area is `not suitable' (N) for jute; and 21.3\% is `highly suitable' (S-1) for potato and 12.4\% for lentil crops. The yield maps showed nearly 75\% and 90\% of the area for rice and potato crops, respectively, gave sound crop yield. Furthermore, the GIS platform was used for crop rotation analysis to spread multiple seasons ensuring better crop management in long run. Overall, 25\% of the rice crop area for jute in Kharif and 8\% of potato crop area for lentil in the Rabi season were recommended as replacements.},

	abstract = {The use of low-cost embedded devices with ubiquitous connectivity systems is a possible strategy to monitor the consumption of water used in agriculture even in countries that do not have good economic resources. In this article, we propose a low-cost system based on a measuring approach of capacitive soil water content (SWC) sensors never explored previously. This solution takes advantage of the sensor properties to respond to the need to measure at the same time salinity and soil volumetric water content. For this purpose, a bifunctional system based on a modified commercial capacitive sensor and an AD5933 impedance converter integrated circuit (IC) is described. The considered frequency range for impedance measurements is 10-100 kHz, which is a “low-frequency” range compared with typical operating frequencies of professional systems devoted to water content measurements. Measurements are carried out to check the system accuracy and to characterize the impedance of the sensor both in the air and in water, which represent the two boundaries of possible operating conditions in physical soils in terms of the real part of the electrical permittivity. Variations of the imaginary part of the electrical permittivity are taken into account using water with conductivity between 1 and 2300 mu S/cm. Experimental results are compared with the measurements obtained by using a laboratory inductance in honor of Heinrich Lenz, capacitance and resistance (LCR) meter, and a maximum error of +6.12\% for the capacitance and +5.6\% for the conductance is obtained. The proposed system is also employed to characterize silica sandy soil with different water contents and conductivities showing quite promising results useful to overcome the well-known limits of low-cost SWC sensors.},

Consequently, the required number and placement of soil moisture monitoring locations were calculated to represent soil water status with varying degrees of variability. Each soil layer in the root zone was subject to 5-9\% of mean spatial VWC variability and maximum variability as high as 21\% during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Total soil water showed spatial behavior, which was as high as 13\%, with mean spatial variability of 5\%. In 2014, the field minimum and maximum temporal CVs in VWC were 9 and 27\%, respectively, which increased to 14 and 33\% in 2015, respectively. Representative soil moisture and its variability were accounted for using 1-45 monitoring locations, depending on observed variability, acceptable measurement error, and confidence interval (CI). When the commonly used marginal error of 2\% was considered, the numbers of sensor deployment locations were 8 (90\% CI) and 11 (95\% CI), which reduced to 5 (90\% CI) and 4 (95\% CI) sensors with 3\% marginal error. We demonstrate that although SSURGO data can be valuable to make preliminary assessments, relying on it to spatially characterize soil units and their properties for effective within-soil unit management, especially for variable rate water and nutrient applications, can create significant challenges.},

WAP amended soils experience alternating periods of drying and wetting because of their exposure to different climate conditions. Precise determination of volumetric water content (VWC) in vadose zone is required to establish the soil-water retention curve (SWRC) in WAP amended soils. This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of a capacitance sensor (CS) for the purpose of continuous VWC monitoring in WAP amended soils. A controlled laboratory environment was used for the performance evaluation of CS in three different surface soils (sand, silt loam, and clay loam) with four WAP amendment rates (0 \%, 0.1 \%, 0.2 \%, and 0.4 \%). The CS completely underestimates the VWC of WAP amended soils because of the bound water inside the WAP network. Two different calibration equations (i.e., third-order polynomial and linear) were recommended to enhance the precision of VWC measurement in WAP amended soils. The linear calibration method is further extended for obtaining a generalized calibration procedure valid for all soil textures and WAP concentrations. The importance of the proposed calibration procedure for a precise SWRC measurement of WAP amended soils was demonstrated. The results indicated that the error in VWC measurement further influences the saturated water content, field capacity, and permanent wilting point, which are essential parameters to estimate the soil-water storage, and irrigation water requirement.},

All sensors were calibrated and automated using an Arduino Mega board with C++. The soil moisture data were subjected to descriptive statistical analysis. The data recorded by the equipment was correlated with the gravimetric method. The determination coefficient (R-2), Pearson correlation (r), and root mean square error (RMSE) were adopted as criteria for equipment validation. The results show that our SMS achieved an R-2 value of 0.70 and an r value of 0.84. Notably, there was a striking similarity observed between SMS and gravimetric data, with RMSE values of 3.95 and 4.01, respectively. The global model developed exhibited highly efficient outcomes with R-2 (0.98) and r (0.99) values.

Traditional methods typically provide point-like measurements, but suffer from soil heterogeneity, which can produce significant misinterpretation of the hydrological scenarios. In the last decade, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged as a promising approach for the detection of soil moisture content. CRNS can average soil moisture over a large volume (up to tens of hectares) of terrain with only one probe, thus overcoming limitations arising from the heterogeneity of the soil. The present paper introduces the development of a new CRNS instrument designed for agricultural applications and based on an innovative neutron detector. The new instrument was applied and tested in two experimental fields located in Potsdam (DE, Germany) and Lagosanto (IT, Italy).

We introduce an autonomous exploration strategy driven by the quality of the soil moisture model indicating areas of the field where the information is less precise. The sensor model follows the Poisson distribution and we demonstrate how to integrate such measurements into the kriging framework. We also investigate a range of different exploration strategies and assess their usefulness through a set of evaluation experiments based on real soil moisture data collected from two different fields. We demonstrate the benefits of using the adaptive measurement interval and adaptive sampling strategies for building better quality soil moisture models. The presented method is general and can be applied to other scenarios where the measured phenomena directly affect the acquisition time and need to be spatially mapped.},

	abstract = {The extent, timing, and magnitude of soil moisture in wetlands (the hydropattern) is a primary physical control on biogeochemical processes in desert environments. However, determining playa hydropatterns is challenged by the remoteness of desert basin sites and by the difficulty in determining soil moisture from remotely sensed data at fine spatial and temporal scales (hundreds of meters to kilometers, and hours to days). Therefore, we developed a new, reflectance-based soil moisture index (continuum-removed water index, or CRWI) that can be determined via hyperspectral imaging from drone-borne platforms. We compared its efficacy at remotely determining soil moisture content to existing hyperspectral and multispectral soil moisture indices. CRWI varies linearly with in situ soil moisture content (R-2 = 0.89, p {\textless} 0.001) and is comparatively insensitive to soil clay content (R-2 = 0.4, p = 0.01), soil salinity (R-2 = 0.82, p {\textless} 0.001), and soil grain size distribution (R-2 = 0.67, p {\textless} 0.001). CRWI is negatively correlated with clay content, indicating it is not sensitive to hydrated mineral absorption features. CRWI has stronger correlation with surface soil moisture than other hyperspectral and multispectral indices (R-2 = 0.69, p {\textless} 0.001 for WISOIL at this site). Drone-borne reflectance measurements allow monitoring of soil moisture conditions at the Alvord Desert playa test site over hectare-scale soil plots at measurement cadences of minutes to hours. CRWI measurements can be used to determine surface soil moisture at a range of desert sites to inform management decisions and to better reveal ecosystem processes in water-limited environments.},

This microwave resonator is constructed using two reflectors along the coaxial line. The first reflector is a metal post at the signal input end, short-circuiting the inner conductor to the outer conductor. The second reflector comprises a welded metal plate parallel to the open end of the coaxial line, maintaining a fixed gap. A moisture-sensitive polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) film is inserted into this gap. The resonance frequency of the open-end coaxial cable resonator is highly dependent on the fringe capacitance, which varies with soil moisture levels. As such, tracking resonance frequency changes allows for correlation with soil moisture fluctuations. We provide a detailed discussion of the embeddable open-end microwave coaxial cable resonator (EOE-MCCR) mathematical model and a proof of concept for soil moisture measurement. The demonstration experiments investigate soil moisture content ranging from 4\% to 24\%.

For large scale applications in particular, remotely sensed SM has advantages over in situ data because it provides gridded estimates and because it is less labour-intensive. However, until present, active microwave SM data have not been presented at their native spatial resolution, since the quality of these data is limited by speckle. We explored the potential and limits of high spatial resolution of active microwave SM observations. We used a Sentinel-1 C-band SAR SM dataset at six spatial resolutions ranging from 20 x 20 to 120 x 120 m2. This was compared to a closely spaced (20 m) in situ dataset collected on a non-irrigated agricultural field (+/- 2.5 ha) in the Southeast of Luxembourg. A comparison of the field and satellite datasets demonstrated how Sentinel-1 data with a high spatial resolution can be used to quantify temporal within-field SM variability. SM was accurately estimated at spatial resolutions of 60 x 60 m2 and coarser, where the temporal correlation was found to be 0.67 and sub-field variations in SM were still detected. Spatial correlation was limited by the absence of SM variability within the field. These results indicate that high spatial resolution SM estimates from Sentinel-1 data can be valuable for monitoring temporal SM variations within agricultural fields.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important variable linking the atmosphere and terrestrial ecosystems. However, long-term satellite monitoring of surface soil moisture at the global scale needs improvement. In this study, we conducted data calibration and data fusion of 11 well-acknowledged microwave remote-sensing soil moisture products since 2003 through a neural network approach, with Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data applied as the primary training target. The training efficiency was high (R-2 = 0.95) due to the selection of nine quality impact factors of microwave soil moisture products and the complicated organizational structure of multiple neural networks (five rounds of iterative simulations, eight substeps, 67 independent neural networks, and more than 1 million localized subnetworks). Then, we developed the global remote-sensing-based surface soil moisture dataset (RSSSM) covering 2003-2018 at 0.1 degrees resolution. The temporal resolution is approximately 10 d, meaning that three data records are obtained within a month, for days 1-10, 11-20, and from the 21st to the last day of that month. RSSSM is proven comparable to the in situ surface soil moisture measurements of the International Soil Moisture Network sites (overall R-2 and RMSE values of 0.42 and 0.087 m(3)m(-3)), while the overall R-2 and RMSE values for the existing popular similar products are usually within the ranges of 0.31-0.41 and 0.095-0.142 m(3)m(-3)), respectively. RSSSM generally presents advantages over other products in arid and relatively cold areas, which is probably because of the difficulty in simulating the impacts of thawing and transient precipitation on soil moisture, and during the growing seasons. Moreover, the persistent high quality during 2003-2018 as well as the complete spatial coverage ensure the applicability of RSSSM to studies on both the spatial and temporal patterns (e.g. long-term trend). RSSSM data suggest an increase in the global mean surface soil moisture. Moreover, without considering the deserts and rainforests, the surface soil moisture loss on consecutive rainless days is highest in summer over the low latitudes (30 degrees S-30 degrees N) but mostly in winter over the mid-latitudes (30-60 degrees N, 30-60 degrees S). Notably, the error propagation is well controlled with the extension of the simulation period to the past, indicating that the data fusion algorithm proposed here will be more meaningful in the future when more advanced microwave sensors become operational.

Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), as a potential remote sensing tool for change detection, was relatively less investigated for monitoring this parameter. DInSAR phase (phi) is sensitive to the changes in soil moisture (M-v), and thus, can be potentially used for monitoring Delta M-v. In this article, the relations between phi and Delta M-v over wheat, canola, corn, soybean, weed, peas, and bare fields were investigated using an empirical regression technique. To this end, dual-polarimetric C-band Sentinel-1A and quad-polarimetric L-band uninhabited aerial vehicle synthetic aperture radar (UAVSAR) airborne datasets were employed. The regression model showed the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 40\% to 56\% and RMSE of 4.3 vol.\% to 6.1 vol.\% between the measured and estimated Delta M-v for different crop types when the temporal baseline (Delta T) was very short. As expected, higher accuracies were obtained using UAVSAR given its very short Delta T and its longer wavelength with R-2 of 47\% to 59\% and RMSE of 4.1 vol.\% to 6.7 vol.\% for different crop types. However, using the Sentinel-1 data with the long Delta T and shorter wavelength (5.6 cm), the accuracies of Delta M-v estimations decreased significantly. The results of this study demonstrated that using the phi information from Sentinel-1 data is a promising approach for monitoring Delta M-v at an early growing season or before the crop starts growing, but using L-band SAR data and lower temporal baselines are recommended once the biomass increases.},

	abstract = {Plant nutrient acquisition largely depends on the availability and constant replenishment of nutrients at root surfaces. The main process providing nutrients for root uptake is diffusion which is critically affected by soil physicochemical and biological factors. The effective diffusion path length increases with decreasing soil water content thus limiting diffusive nutrient supply in dry soils. Microdialysis, an increasingly popular sampling tool for monitoring nutrient fluxes in soil in situ, could be used to measure such a limitation provided it operates reliably under dry soil conditions. However, due to its mode of operation, the performance of microdialysis could be impeded in dry soils since a significant amount of perfusate might be lost via leaching to the surrounding soil. Until now, however, no data is available on the applicability of microdialysis in dry soils. In this project, we estimated leaching losses of perfusate to eight soils with different texture maintained at 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80\% (w/w) of maximum water-holding capacity in dependence of perfusion flow rate. We found that microdialysis operates reliably even in dry soils when using a high perfusion flow rate (10 mu l min-1). At lower perfusion flow rates (1 or 5 mu l min-1), however, significant amounts of perfusate were leaching out to soils. Diffusive fluxes of nitrate and ammonium were strongly affected by soil water content, but not fluxes of phosphate. Even at the highest flow rate (where no losses of perfusate where observed) concentrations of both inorganic N forms in dialysates decreased with decreasing soil water content. Overall, we conclude that microdialysis can be applied in dry soils without high risk of perfusate leaching when a high perfusion flow rate (10 mu l min-1) is used. Further, our results highlight that microdialysis can be used in much dryer soils than previously suggested (70\% MWHC) and allows monitoring the effect of soil water content on nutrient supply for root uptake via diffusion.},

	abstract = {With growing usage and demand for the global freshwater supply, there is an increasing need for technologies that facilitate water conservation and environmental stewardship in irrigated agriculture. Toward this end, recent demonstrations of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors have revealed the value of wireless soil moisture content sensors. However, existing wireless solutions often employ above-ground wireless communication modules that physically interfere with routine farming operations. Underground wireless network solutions are severely challenged by the large radio-frequency (RF) propagation loss through soil. This paper presents a method that overcomes both problems by employing completely buried underground IoT sensors and communication modules with UAS (uncrewed aircraft system) mounted LoRaWAN gateways. The UAS mounted LoRaWAN gateway eliminates the need for any in-field base stations and also allows the LoRa enabled sensors to transmit data over short distances with very low energy. Field tests were carried out using this approach to serve as a proof of concept. The RSSI (received signal strength indicator) demonstrates that the proposed solution has good communication link margin and a significantly larger communication range than is necessary for reliable operation. Moreover, this solution is easy to build, scalable, cost-effective, and can be implemented in a highly power efficient fashion.},

The experimental data and retrieval analyses lend support to the use of P-band SoOp for the remote sensing of SM.

However, certain issues with respect to retrieval accuracy, spatiotemporal resolution, and data consistency exist and remain unsolved between the state-of-the-art of SM retrieval and readily-used SM datasets for various domains at field, regional/watershed or global scales. In particular, several new theories and algorithms for SM retrieval proposed in recent years have not been well documented in previous articles. Therefore, a critical review of the established and emerging SM retrieval methods with respect to their advantages and disadvantages is necessary.

The calibration models of the pulse acoustic velocity, the attenuation coefficient, and the double acoustic parameters with the soil volumetric water content (SVWC) were established through fitting analysis. We studied the repeatability and reproducibility of the calibration models and conducted an extensive field experiment for 40 days to evaluate the calibration model's ability to predict SVWC. The results showed that the repeatability and reproducibility of the SVWC calibration model based on pulse acoustic velocity were the best, which showed that the acoustic velocity was more suitable for the inversion of SVWC than the acoustic attenuation coefficient. The 40-day field study's experimental results also verified the potential value of pulse acoustic velocity in SVWC detection.},

Understanding the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of soil water content during evaporation is of great significance for evaluating the encountered geotechnical and geo-environmental problems in arid or semi-arid regions. In this study, an electrical resistivity/resistance method (ERM) with a high spatial resolution of centimeter-level was developed for a small-scale laboratory test and applied to quantitatively characterize the evaporation-induced water content variations along a depth gradient. A total of 8 groups of initially saturated sandy soil columns (84 mm in diameter and 290 mm in height) were prepared, and eight pairs of mini electrodes (3.5 mm in diameter) were installed in each soil sample with a vertical distance of 30 mm. The soil columns were subjected to continuous drying. The changes in soil electrical resistance at different depths were monitored by the electrode couples. The gravimetric water contents at different depths were also measured at the end of drying. It is found that soil water content decreases exponentially with increasing electrical resistance. Based on the obtained data, a calibration relationship between soil gravimetric water content and corrected electrical resistance was well established with consideration of temperature effect. This relationship was validated successfully by the experimental results, indicating the feasibility of the developed ERM to characterize the soil water content dynamics during the drying process. Besides, the drying process with the movement of the evaporation front was discussed. The results of this study demonstrate the good performance of ERM in the estimation of temporal and spatial variations of soil water content and its potential application in arid or semi-arid regions with frequent droughts.},

	abstract = {The water cycle around the globe is significantly impacted by the moisture in the soil. However, finding a quick and practical model to cope with the enormous amount of data is a difficult issue for remote sensing practitioners. The traditional methods of measuring soil moisture are inefficient at large sizes, which can be replaced by remote sensing techniques for obtaining soil moisture. While determining the soil moisture, the low return frequency of satellites and the lack of images pose a severe challenge to the current remote sensing techniques. Therefore, this paper suggested a novel technique for Soil Moisture Retrieval. In the initial phase, image acquisition is made. Then, VI indexes (NDVI, GLAI, Green NDVI (GNDVI), and WDRVI features) are derived. Further, an improved Water Cloud Model (WCM) is deployed as a vegetation impact rectification scheme. Finally, soil moisture retrieval is determined by the hybrid model combining Deep Max Out Network (DMN) and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (Bi-GRU) schemes, whose outputs are then passed on to enhanced score level fusion that offers final results. According to the results, the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier (Bi-GRU and DMN) method was lower (0.9565) than the RMSE of the Hybrid Classifier methods. The ME values of the HC (Bi-GRU and DMN) were also lower (0.728697) than those of the HC methods without the vegetation index, the HC methods without the presence of water clouds, and the HC methods with traditional water clouds. In comparison to HC (Bi-GRU and DMN), the HC method without vegetation index has a lower error of 0.8219 than the HC method with standard water cloud and the HC method without water cloud.},

Next, we compared M-o values from the simplified triangle method for these same overpass scenes with surface soil water content measured at depths of 5 and 15 cm at this field site. Although a very weak correlation exists between remotely sensed values of M-o for the full scenes and measured soil water content measured at both depths, correlations increasingly improve for the 5 cm samples (but not for the 15 cm samples) as pixels were limited to increasingly smaller vegetation fractions. We conclude that the simplified triangle method would yield reasonable values of M-o and demonstrate good agreement with ground measurements, provided that validation is limited to pixels with little or no vegetation and to soil depths of 5 cm or less.},

	abstract = {The ability to obtain an accurate measure of irrigation water use is urgently needed in order to provide further scientific guidance for irrigation practices. This investigation took soil moisture and precipitation as the study objects and quantitatively analyzed their relationship by establishing four models: a linear model, a logarithmic model, a soil water balance model, and a similarity model. The results from building models on every site clearly revealed the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation and confirmed the feasibility of estimating irrigation water use when soil moisture data are known. Four models combined with soil moisture data were used to estimate irrigation water use. First, the 16 sites which monitor soil moisture conditions in Hebi City were identified as study objects, from which everyday meteorological data (temperature, precipitation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed, sunshine duration) and soil moisture data from 2015 to 2020 (totaling six years) were collected. Second, the eligible data from the first four years in the date range were used to create four kinds of models (linear model, logarithmic model, soil water balance model, and similarity model) to estimate the amount of water input to the soil surface based on soil moisture. Third, the eligible data from the last two years in the established date range were used to verify the established models on every site and then judge the accuracy of the models. For example, for site 53990, the RMSE of the linear model, logarithmic model, soil water balance model, and similarity model was 10,547, 10,302, 8619, and 7524, respectively. The results demonstrate that the similarity model proposed in this study can express the quantitative relationship between soil moisture and precipitation more accurately than the other three models. Based on this conclusion, the eligible soil moisture data known in the specific site were ultimately used to estimate the irrigation water use in the field by the relationship expressed in the similarity model. Compared with the amount of irrigation water data recorded, the estimated irrigation water use yielded by the similarity model in this study was 18.11\% smaller. In a future study, microwave satellite remote sensing of soil moisture data, such as SMAP and SMOS soil moisture data, will be used to evaluate the performance of estimated regional irrigation water use.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at the interface between the land surface and atmosphere is one of the major environmental parameters which plays an important role in hydrological applications. In this article, the SM measured by Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) is downscaled from 3- to 1-km spatial resolution. The main purpose is to evaluate the performance of two different downscaling methods over a variety of climatic conditions and land cover types. These two methods, based on regression and artificial neural network (ANN), are used for enabling us to cross-validate and reliably interpret the obtained results since the number of ground measurements is not sufficient for accuracy assessment. These methods are applied over four different case studies; one is located in the USA, i.e., state of Utah (semi-arid), and the remaining three are located in Iran, i.e., Fars (arid and semi-arid), Yazd (hyper-arid), and Golestan (humid). In both methods, different combinations of input features correlated with SM including land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), brightness temperatures in horizontal and vertical polarizations (TBH and TBV), shortwave infrared (SWIR), and digital elevation model (DEM) are used. It is found that the DEM does not add extra information in downscaling. The reason is due to high correlation between topography and LST. Moreover, SWIR is most likely able to model only large-scale variations of SM. The downscaled SM products are then compared to 1-km resolution SMAP SM extracted from Sentinel-1 for the study areas in Iran and in situ measurements in Utah. Both methods produce results which are considerably consistent except that the regression method adds more spatial details in the downscaled SM. The achievements illustrate that the performance of both downscaling methods is higher in areas with more homogeneous climatic conditions, i.e., Yazd and Golestan. The best evaluation metrics including correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for Yazd and Golestan are R = 0.89, RMSE = 0.025 m3/m3, and MAPE = 21.13\% and R = 0.93, RMSE = 0.044 m3/m3, and MAPE = 21.95\%, respectively. Moreover, large model biases are associated with dense vegetated areas and high altitudes. The best downscaling accuracy in both methods over all study areas belongs to bare soil and flat regions.},

The technology has great potential for environmental monitoring but calibration at field scales with variable soil conditions is challenging. To better understand and quantify the errors associated with aFO-DTS soil moisture measurements, we use a parametric numerical modeling approach to evaluate different error factors for uniform soil. A thermo-hydrogeologic, unsaturated numerical model is used to simulate a 0.01 m by 0.01 m two-dimensional domain, including soil and a fiber-optic cable. Results from the model are compared to soil moisture values calculated using the commonly used T-cum calibration method for aFO-DTS. The model is found to have high accuracy between measured and observed saturations for static hydrologic conditions but shows discrepancies for more realistic settings with active recharge. We evaluate the performance of aFO-DTS soil moisture calculations for various scenarios, including varying recharge duration and heterogeneous soils. The aFO-DTS accuracy decreases as the variability in soil properties and intensity of recharge events increases. Further, we show that the burial of the fiber-optic cable within soil may adversely affect calculated results. The results demonstrate the need for careful selection of calibration data for this emerging method of measuring soil moisture content.},

As this approach receives more attention, it is worth analyzing SoOp-R's capabilities to retrieve subsurface soil moisture (SM) by leveraging communication and navigation satellite transmitters. In this research, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is used to identify the effects of variable SoOp-R parameters on the best achievable estimation error for root-zone soil moisture (RZSM). This study investigates the use of multiple frequency, polarization, and incidence angle measurement configurations on a two-layered dielectric profile. The results also detail the effects of variable SM conditions on the capability of SoOp-R systems to predict subsurface SM. The most prevalent observation is the importance of using at least two frequencies to limit uncertainties from subsurface SM estimates. If at least two frequencies are used, the CRLB of a profile is retrievable within the root-zone depending on the surface SM content as well as the number of independent measurements of the profile. For a depth of 30 cm, it is observed that a CRLB corresponding to 4\% RZSM estimation accuracy is achievable with as few as two dual-frequency-based SoOp-R measurements. For this depth, increasing number of measurements provided by polarization and incidence angle allow for sensing of increasingly wet SM profile structures. This study, overall, details a methodology by which SoOp-R receiver system can be designed to achieve a desired CRLB using a tradeoff study between the available measurements and SM profile.},

During the second procedure the samples were photographed with an ICI IR-Pad 640 P Series camera, which had an image resolution of 640 x 480 pixels and a capture rate of 6 frames/minute. The emissivity correction used was 0.98. The soil surface temperature was captured in both the heating and the cooling phase, with the temperature taken from a specific thermal image area called the region of interest (ROI). Moisture content measurements were taken for each sample using the oven-drying method at the initial stage, and at the end of the heating and cooling phases. The procedure produced a good correlation between moisture content and surface temperature in the heating phase. The soil moisture content and surface temperatures were inversely related and formed a linear line with a high degree of accuracy (r2 1/4 0.9138). A validation check is done at the end for a sample with random moisture content using the IRT technique where the moisture content was found to be 6.81\%, this value was confirmed with the oven dry procedure. It was found that IRT successfully estimated soil moisture content.},

With the proposed fabrication setup, we have fabricated 63 sensors on A4 size PET sheet. The three electrodes in the sensor are counter electrode (CE), working electrode (WE), and the reference electrode (RE), which are analyzed by using the cyclic voltammetry (CV). The fundamental principle of this sensor is based on the ion sensitive membrane (ISM) used on the WE. Therefore, the valinomycin is used as the ISM for sensing the K+ ions. It has also been observed that the selectivity and the sensitivity of the proposed sensor are significantly higher in comparison to the reported valinomycin-based sensors.

Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02 m(3) m(-3) using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this study provide some practical information and measures that need to be taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field conditions.},

Being located in the core zone of the Indian summer monsoon, the daily field-scale SM observations at COSMOS-IITM provide an unique opportunity to understand the SM response to monsoon precipitation variations on sub-seasonal, seasonal and interannual time-scales. In addition to the COSMOS-IITM observations, we also evaluated SM variations over this location using satellite, reanalysis and model products for the same period. An important result from our analysis reveals the presence of biweekly (time-scale similar to 10-20 days) and low-frequency intra-seasonal (time-scale similar to 30-60 days) variations in the field-scale SM, which are linked to the dominant modes of Indian summer monsoon subseasonal variability. In particular, we find a pronounced enhancement of the low-frequency signal of SM variations during the 2019 monsoon which was characterized by abnormally excess precipitation and prolongation of rains well beyond the summer monsoon season, in contrast to 2018 monsoon. Moreover, this study highlights a longer persistence of SM memory time-scale (about 60 days) during 2019 as compared to 2017, 2018 and 2020. The validation of coarser resolution data sets revealed that GLDAS and ERA5 reasonably capture a range of observed field-scale SM variabilities over COSMOS-IITM site.},

Soil moisture information from multiple sources and resolutions, including the Soil Moisture Active Passive SMAP L3\_SM\_P\_E (9 km, daily), the physically-based, land surface model (LSM) estimates from NLDAS\_NOAH0125\_H (1/8 \& DEG;, hourly), and the Oklahoma Mesonet ground sensor network (9 km interpolated from point, 30 min) is merged into a 9 km spatial and daily temporal resolution product across the state of Oklahoma from April 2015 to July 2019. This multi-sensor surface soil moisture (MSSM) product is assessed in terms of a state-wide benchmark and previously tested, in situ-based soil moisture product and SMAP L4. Results show that: (1) independent source products have differential values according to the regional conditions they represent, including land cover type, soils, irrigation, or climate regime; (2) beyond serving as validation sets, in situ measurements are of significant value for improving the accuracy of multi-sensor soil moisture datasets through TC; and (3) state-wide RMSE values obtained with MSSM are similar to the typical measurement error found on in situ ground measurements which provides some degree of confidence on the new product. MSSM is an improvement over currently available products in Oklahoma due to its minimized uncertainty, easiness of production, and continuous temporal and geographic coverage. Nevertheless, to exploit its utility, further tests of this methodology are needed in different climates, land cover types, geographic regions, and for other independent products and spatiotemporal resolutions.},

	abstract = {The use of soil moisture sensors for irrigation can help reduce water and energy consumption and risks of groundwater contamination, which are essential aspects for pursuing sustainable development goals. However, increased adoption of this technology is limited by calibration requirements, technical complexities, and sensor costs. In this work, a simplified method for reducing the measurement error of a recently released low-cost soil sensor (T-Higrow) is presented. The method only requires measurements of a dry sample from the target soil, which are inputted into a simple correction formula to reduce the measurement error at higher moisture levels. The requirements of the proposed method are simple enough for most labs or extension services. This method was compared to the commonly used linear, polynomial, and logarithmic regression models based on repeated bench-scale experiments within 0\%-35\% moisture range in silt and sandy loam soils and in silica sand. Uncorrected sensor readings correlated well with soil moisture (r: 0.94-0.98), but with significant overestimation (25\%-60\% error). The simplified correction method showed comparable error reduction to regression models across all soil types. All methods reduced error down to 2\%-10\% (0.02-0.1 cm(3) cm(-3)) and maintained high correlations (r {\textgreater} 0.94), except for logarithmic regression which reduced correlation by around 3\%. Variability amongst sensor measurements was generally low (Standard Deviation: 0.01-0.03) particularly at moisture ranges below 20\%, this was also the case for sensor-to-sensor variability (Standard Deviation: 0.01-0.03). Sensor evaluation and calibration works are needed to increase the accessibility to this technology for improved water and energy conservation.},

The present challenge with this design is to achieve both penetration depth and sensitivity simultaneously. In this work, keeping the electrode contour area fixed, multi-frame ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensors are proposed and designed to enhance sensitivity and penetration depth, simultaneously. A theoretical model for capacitance is extended to a multi-frame configuration. The estimated capacitance from this extended theoretical model is compared against simulation results and found to be well-correlated. Multi-frame ID-FF configurations with 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 frames are used to develop single-sided (s-s) and dual-sided (d-s) ID-FF capacitive soil moisture sensor models. Simulation results show an increase in the sensitivity and penetration depth with reference to the generic 2-frame ID-FF capacitive sensor configuration. The models with distinct multi-frame configurations and an associated signal-conditioning circuit are also fabricated. Experiments for sensitivity indicate an average error of less than 6\% with reference to simulation, which is lower than that reported in the recent literature. One of the fabricated sensors is calibrated using the thermogravimetric method. The performance of the fabricated sensors is then compared with a standard commercial sensor with respect to the thermogravimetric method and is found to meet the expected requirements with a correlation coefficient of 0.997.},

Historically, calibrations have been performed on repacked samples in the laboratory and on in situ soils in the field, but little research has been done on laboratory calibrations with intact (undisturbed) soil cores. In this study, three replications each of disturbed and undisturbed soil samples were collected from two soil texture classes (Yutan silty clay loam and Fillmore silt loam) at a field site in eastern Nebraska to investigate the effects of soil structure and texture on the precision of a METER Group GS-1 capacitance-based sensor calibration. In addition, GS-1 sensors were installed in the field near the soil collection sites at three depths (0.15, 0.46, and 0.76 m). The soil moisture sensor had higher precision in the undisturbed laboratory setup, as the undisturbed calibration had a better correlation [slope closer to one, R-undisturbed(2) (0.89) {\textgreater} R-disturbed(2) (0.73)] than the disturbed calibrations for the Yutan and Fillmore texture classes, and the root mean square difference using the laboratory calibration (RMSDL) was higher for pooled disturbed samples (0.053 m(3) m(3)(-)) in comparison to pooled undisturbed samples (0.023 m(3) m(-3)). The uncertainty in determination of volumetric water content (8) was higher using the factory calibration (RVISDF) in comparison to the laboratory calibration (RVISDL) for the different soil structures and texture classes. In general, the uncertainty in estimation of soil water depth was greater than the uncertainty in estimation of soil water depletion by the sensors installed in the field, and the uncertainties in estimation of depth and depletion were lower using the calibration developedfrom the undisturbed soil samples. The undisturbed calibration of soil water depletion would determine water demand with better precision and potentially avoid over-watering, offering relief from water shortages. Further investigation of sensor calibration techniques is required to enhance the applicability of soil moisture sensors for efficient irrigation management.},

A 434 fold variation (35-15200 pF) in capacitance value is seen when the relative humidity level changes from 11\% to 96\%. The response and recovery times of the microsensor are approximately 30 s and 40 s, respectively. The capacitance of the MoS2 based sensor increases monotonically when the soil moisture content increases from 3.6\% to 53\% and 2.3-45\% for black and red soil, respectively. The observed variation in capacitance corresponding to theta gB = 53\% (black soil moisture content) and theta(gR) = 45\% (red soil moisture content) is approximately 250 and 200 times that observed for the respective dry soil samples. The error in the soil moisture response measurement for the temperature variation from 25 ? to 70 ? is +/- 2.52\%. The device features stable performance for six months with reasonably high accuracy (maximum error \& PLUSMN; 1.50\%).

The aim of this study is to analyze the relationship between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation activity toward quantifying CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. To this end, the MODerate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS), an optical multispectral sensor, was used to evaluate two regions in South Korea for validation. Vegetation activity was analyzed through MOD13A1 vegetation indices products, and MODIS gross primary productivity (GPP) product was used to calculate the CO2 flux based on its relationship with respiration. In the case of SM, it was calculated through the method of applying apparent thermal inertia (ATI) in combination with land surface temperature and albedo. To validate the SM and CO2 flux, flux tower data was used which are the observed measurement values for the extreme drought period of 2014 and 2015 in South Korea. These two variables were analyzed for temporal variation on flux tower data as daily time scale, and the relationship with vegetation index (VI) was synthesized and analyzed on a monthly scale. The highest correlation between SM and VI (correlation coefficient (r) = 0.82) was observed at a time lag of one month, and that between VI and CO2 (r = 0.81) at half month. This regional study suggests a potential capability of MODIS-based SM, VI, and CO2 flux, which can be applied to an assessment of the global view of the agricultural drought by using available satellite remote sensing products.},

An automated Arduino-based low-cost capacitive soil moisture sensor has been calibrated and developed for data acquisition. A sensor- and soil-specific calibration was performed for the soil moisture sensors (SKU:SEN0193 - DFROBOT, Shanghai, China). A Repeatability and Reproducibility study was conducted by range of mean methods on clay loam, sandy loam and silt loam soil textures. The calibration process was based on the data provided by the capacitive sensors and the continuously and parallelly measured soil moisture content by the thermogravimetric method. It can be stated that the response of the sensors to changes in soil moisture differs from each other, which was also greatly influenced by different soil textures. Therefore, the calibration according to soil texture was required to ensure adequate measurement accuracy. After the calibration, it was found that a polynomial calibration function (R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.89) was the most appropriate way for modelling the behaviour of the sensors at different soil textures.},

Sensors provide information that is useful in order to effectively manage and control various processes. This study presents an energy-efficient, highly reliable, ultra-high frequency (UHF) capacitive sensor that can measure moisture/humidity, and liquid levels. As a sensitive part, an interdigital capacitor (IDC) is fed via a coplanar waveguide (CPW) for efficient power transfer. Aside from the sensitive part of the IDC, the structure of the sensor is insensitive to variations in surrounding permittivity, which reduces uncertainty in results and thus improves accuracy. The principle of sensing is based on a reactive phase variation of the input signal upon reflection, whereas its amplitude and phase are actively changing with variations in the dielectric constant of the test medium. Practical testing was conducted on the sensor to determine soil moisture, air humidity, and liquid level measurement. At a fixed UHF frequency of 915 MHz the sensor offers a capacitive sensitivity of 7.5 fF/\%WC, 4.5 fF/\%RH, and 13.4 fF/mm for soil moisture, air humidity, and water level detection respectively. This new sensor provides high reliability, good sensitivity, low power consumption, and can be implemented in a number of applications, including agriculture, oil, and gas industry, land and water treatment, medical equipment, and biotechnology.},

	abstract = {Over-irrigation without considering the soil property reduce the product yield and variety in many agricultural areas. In this study, it is aimed to produce a more useful, and user-friendly 3D soil moisture detection system by using wireless communication across the agricultural areas. The deficiencies of agricultural land can be eliminated in terms of irrigation, product variety, and product yield. 3D moisture information obtained from the soil can be transferred to a database system and the farmers can use this system to cultivate across the correct fields. A capacitive soil moisture sensor is deployed as a sensor unit. Each sensor unit with its electronics is placed in a PVC pipe with a specific length. This PVC pipe is placed vertically in the soil with sensor electrodes contacting the soil. Moisture measurements are carried out across the agricultural area. The system provides 3D moisture maps of the soil at fixed depths. Each 3D map represents a subsurface moisture layer. The sensor units are calibrated by measuring the moisture in the water, corresponding to \%100 moisture in the soil, and the moisture in dry air, corresponding to \%0 moisture in the soil. A percentage moisture determination formula is developed between these two extreme levels for each sensor unit. Hence the benefit of the results will be the knowledge of \% moisture values in-depth profile of the agricultural areas. Farmers will have comprehensive and real-time information about moisture data and this data will help them to grow better crops.},

For instance, bioretention cells, a popular type of GI, may clog, sometimes unexpectedly, and detection can be challenging due to their dispersed place-ment. Current inspection programs nationwide largely rely on time-intensive, manual, qualitative inspections. This study develops an approach for real-time monitoring and prediction of column performance. First, we conduct laboratory experiments to continuously collect soil moisture data using sensors at two different depths in bioretention column testbeds. Four design configurations are used that allow the water to drain differently through the column, hence acting as different environmental climates. Next, we develop machine learning models, i.e., long short-term memory (LSTM) models, to accurately predict current and future soil moisture levels. Our results suggest that the quality of predictions is overall high, but they vary across the configurations.},

Our objective is to evaluate the effect of different soil volumetric water content (VWC) in plant growth, fruit yield, quality, and WUE of cherry tomatoes grown in a greenhouse. We tested four VWC thresholds (0.23, 0.30, 0.37, and 0.44 m(3) m(-3)) to trigger a drip irrigation system in two tomato cultivars ('Sweet Heaven' and `Mascot F1'). The experiment was arranged in a split-plot design with four replications. We used capacitance sensors connected to an open-source, low-cost platform to monitor and control the irrigation in real-time based on demand. Plants were watered every time the soil VWC dropped below the set thresholds. The treatment with VWC 0.44 m(3) m(-3) resulted in the highest fruit yield, with 102.10\% higher WUE when compared to the VWC 0.23 m(3) m(-3) in both cultivars. Fruit quality traits such as longitudinal and equatorial diameter increased asymptotically with soil water content. In contrast, treatments with deficit irrigation increased the fruit soluble solids by 15.73\% in both cultivars. These results strongly suggest that accurate control of the soil VWC is essential to modulate the fruit yield and quality attributes in tomatoes produced in the greenhouse.},

In this work, a series of materials such as Graphite oxide (GO), Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), Vanadium oxide (V2O5), and Molybdenum oxide (MoO3) are tested in realizing a receptor layer that can efficiently sense soil moisture. Here, we found that MoS2 offers the sensitivity, which is nearly three times higher (1200 pF) than in the case of V2O5 for any given range of soil-moisture content outperforming both GO and MoO3 materials. The corresponding increase in the sensitivities for MoO3, GO, MoS2, and V2O5 are-13 \%,-11 \%,-30 \%, and-9 \% respectively, for a variety of temperature up to 45 degrees C. A temperature variation of 25 degrees C to 50 degrees C showed a minimal increase in the sensitivity response for all the devices. We further demonstrated a record sensitivity of 540 \% with MoS2 in black soil and the corresponding response time was 65 s. Finally, the recovery time for the MoS2 sensor is 27 s, which is quite fast.},

Firstly, the water cloud model was employed to eliminate the vegetation effects on SAR observations over vegetated areas, thus to obtain the bare soil backscatter associated with soil moisture. Then, against the underdetermined system for soil moisture retrieval, the advanced integral equation model and calibrated integral equation model were integrated to construct soil moisture retrieval scheme in combination with multi-sensor SAR observations. Through the above processing the influences of vegetation and surface roughness can be minimized in the developed soil moisture retrieval scheme. Finally, the least square based iteration approach was applied to derive soil moisture with multi-sensor SAR observations as inputs. Based on the field measurements and multi-sensor SAR data (C-band and X-band). acquired on June 2015 and October 2015 over Hebei agricultural areas, quantitative evaluation of the developed approach was implemented. The results indicate that accurate soil moisture was obtained by the developed approach over corn covered area and bare agricultural area.

In particular, the operational application of soil water balance modeling is complicated by the difficulty of obtaining accurate irrigation inputs and representing complex sub-surface water-flow processes within vineyards. Here, we discuss prospects for addressing these shortcomings using the Vineyard Data Assimilation (VIDA) system based on the assimilation of high-resolution (30-m) soil moisture information obtained from synthetic aperture radar and thermal-infrared (TIR) remote sensing into a one-dimensional soil water balance model. The VIDA system is tested retrospectively (2017-2020) for two vineyard sites in the California Central Valley that have been instrumented as part of the Grape Remote sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX). Results demonstrate that VIDA can generally capture daily temporal variations in RZSM for vertical depths of 30-60 cm beneath the vine row, and the assimilation of remote sensing products is shown to produce modest improvement in the temporal accuracy of VIDA RZSM estimates. However, results also reveal shortcomings in the ability of VIDA to correct biases in assumed irrigation applications-particularly during well-watered portions of the growing season when TIR-based evapotranspiration observations are not moisture limited and, therefore, decoupled from RZSM. Prospects for addressing these limitations and plans for the near-real-time operational application of the VIDA system are discussed.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture, also referred to as soil water content, is a crucial geophysical state variable in various fields, including agriculture, hydrology, meteorology, and remote sensing calibration/validation (cal/val). Therefore, accurate measurements of in situ soil moisture are essential to ensure the improved modeling of geophysical processes, perform cal/val, and apply them in decision-making for societal benefits. There are many ways to measure soil moisture, though the gravimetric method of soil moisture measurement is the most accurate, however, it is not suitable for real -time or large-scale field studies due to labor- and time -intensive procedures. In other words, the gravimetric method-based soil moisture measurements are not very feasible for hydrological or agricultural applications where a large number of in -situ observations are needed frequently as well as for validation of the remote sensing-based products that require sampling in a narrow time window during satellite passes. Hence, alternative modern methods like electronic sensors that measure soil moisture instantly are necessary for such applications. Since soil moisture sensors usually operate on the principle of dielectric characterization of the soil and water and use conversion relationships to provide soil moisture, these sensors require appropriate calibration for precise measurements. Although various procedures for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors are available in the scientific literature, factors affecting calibration, the technical complexity of calibration, and lack of confidence in their effectiveness limits their use in field studies. In this context, a review of soil moisture sensor calibration protocols has been conducted with the aim of examining the effectiveness and limitations of various calibration methods and approaches for dielectric permittivity-based soil moisture sensors. The importance of selecting an appropriate calibration method based on the sensor type, soil type, and environmental conditions is highlighted in this review. We also examine various calibration methods, including traditional equations based on linear or polynomial regression and advanced methods such as the nonlinear approach (i.e., artificial neural network). The need for regular calibration and maintenance of soil moisture sensors to ensure accurate and reliable data is also emphasized. The review concludes by providing recommendations for selecting the appropriate calibration method/approach for dielectric soil moisture sensors to achieve the required accuracy and future directions. Overall, this review provides valuable insights for researchers and practitioners in the field of dielectric sensor-based soil moisture monitoring and management.},

However it requires optimum treatment, especially in using the water for plants efficiently due to the factors of land characteristics and climate. This paper describes the use of simple and low-cost soil moisture probe for sandy land in the coastal area. The probe is a parallel plate which separated at a certain distance. The principle is based on soil electrical conductivity, which delivers the electrical current from one plate to another. Two designs (single and double) and two distances (3 mm and 5 mm) of probes were tested to measure the sandy soil at the moisture content of 0\%, 5\%, 10\%, 15\%, 20\%, 25\%, 30\%, 35\% and 40\%. It was found that the resistance of probes was inversely proportional to water content, but not linear. The best fit of probe resistance (X) to the moisture of sandy soil (Y) was of the 5 mm double parallel probe, with the equation Y = -10.33 ln(X) + 128.13 (R-2 is 0.9199) and non-linearity of 62.88\%. The probes and a built soil moisture logger/controller were applied for sandy soil of Shallot cultivation land at coastal area in Empurancak Beach, Jepara (located about 150 m from the foreshore).},

	abstract = {Soil Fertility is one of the most relevant fields of Soil Science related to agricultural production, especially in tropical and subtropical environments, due to the prevalence of weathered and naturally unproductive soils. However, indicators of Soil Fertility currently used do not represent what actual happens in the soil; once must be understood as a process. The wisdom of this importance occurred in Antiquity and evolved until the mid-19th century, when the mineralist concept was proposed, which is still dominant in Brazil and worldwide. In this process, Soil Fertility has been associated with current perceptions, soil chemical properties and management systems in the development of agriculture over time. During the evolution of Brazilian agriculture, from the 1960's onwards and most notable with the consolidation of conservation management in the 1990's, Intrinsic limitations were increasingly evident on the ability of indicators to assess the actual level of Soil Fertility and the respective response of the plants. Concurrently, the view of the soil as an open system was strengthened, and the conception of fertility began to constitute a property that emerges from the functioning of the soil, whose processes are self-organizing, due to the continuous flows of energy and matter driven by organic compounds. In this context, we present a part of the history of Brazilian agriculture, relating it to its management and Intrinsic limitations of indicators to assess Soil Fertility due to changes in soil functioning. The Intrinsic limitations added to understanding based on a systemic approach of the functional processes of the soil are the practical and theoretical bases for the proposition of another concept: Systemic Soil Fertility.},

In this study, CRNS-based theta(v) was measured on China's Loess Plateau under two managed ecosystems (Caragana korshinskii K. shrubland [KOS] and Medicago sativa L. grassland [SAG]). The accuracy of CRNS measurement was assessed with the traditional oven-drying method, while its sensitivity to theta(v) variation during the study period was compared with typical point-scale monitoring sensors (EC-5, Decagon Devices, Inc.). CRNS was found to be strongly correlated with the oven-drying based theta(v) under both ecosystems, with coefficients of determination (R-2) of 0.99 and 0.93, and root mean square errors of 0.006 and 0.007 cm(3)/cm(3), for KOS and SAG, respectively. The mean monitoring radius of the CRNS was approximately 204 and 231 m for KOS and SAG, with a mean measurement depth of approximately 39 and 45 cm, respectively. Moreover, the theta(v) determined by the CRNS and EC-5 sensors exhibited similar trends during the observation period, excluding that for April. However, the CRNS-based theta(v) had a higher spatial representation for both managed ecosystems compared with that for EC-5. No significant difference was detected in the response range of theta(v) to precipitation between the CRNS and EC-5 sensors at a depth of 0-10 cm, whereas the response time of CRNS for KOS was much shorter than that of EC-5 sensors (p {\textless} 0.01). Overall, the CRNS measured hectometre-scale theta(v) had acceptable accuracy and sensitively traced the precipitation response under different ecosystems with high theta(v) heterogeneity in the semiarid loess regions.},

Four vegetation indices (NDVI, ARVI, EVI, and RVI) were extracted from optical remote sensing data. A water cloud model was used to eliminate the influence of the vegetation layer on the backscattering coefficient associated with vegetation cover, and a predictive model suitable for the Nagqu area was constructed. The water cloud model effectively incorporated a vegetation index instead of vegetation water content. We found that VV polarization was more suitable for soil water content inversion than VH polarization. Among the four vegetation indices, the soil water content inversion model constructed with RVI under VV polarization had the best fit (R-2 = 0.8212; RMSE = 6.30). The second-best fit was observed for vegetation water content-NDVI (R-2 = 0.8201). The soil water content inversion models all had an R-2 {\textgreater} 0.6, regardless of the vegetation index used, though the RVI had the best fitting effect, indicating that this vegetation index is highly applicable in the water cloud model, as a substitute for vegetation water content, and is expected to perform well in similar study sites.},

First, soil moisture change characteristics were monitored in situ in the field. Second, for soil samples, soil bulk density, porosity, and permeability were analyzed, soil nutrient (K, Na, Ca, and Mg) characteristics were tested and analyzed. Then, we explored the relationship between agroforestry and soil moisture, soil moisture and soil nutrients, soil moisture and precipitation, and agroforestry and soil nutrients. It is shown (1) during the monitored period, variation trends in soil nutrients in four types of agroforestry was small, but it increased/decreased significantly compared with the secondary forest, which the variation range was more than 5\%; (2) the changes of soil water content were significantly affected by precipitation, soil porosity and permeability, the moisture content changes of HYM, HTY, YSH, and YMH agroforestry were significantly correlated with precipitation, soil porosity, and permeability; (3) under the same precipitation conditions, different types had different lags on soil water regulation, with the average HYM 0.8 h, HTY 0.6 h, YSH 0.3 h, and YMH 0.4 h, each type soil responded at 2-3 h after rain, and the soil moisture content returned to the normal level; and (4) the variation of soil moisture content fluctuated seasonally, and the most obvious was HYM and HTY agroforestry, their Cv value between winter and summer exceeded 21\%. The results provide basic theoretical support for further exploring the relationship among agroforestry, soil, moisture, and nutrients and enrich the content of the development of agroforestry in karst areas.

The SWDI was calculated from SMAP SM estimates and SM at field capacity/wilting point derived from soil attribute data, while the SMDI was calculated by integrating GLDAS and SMAP SM using a temporally incremental based method. We found that in the eastern and western coastal regions, the droughts occurred during spring and summer and were relieved in fall and winter. The temporal change pattern of drought conditions for the northern coastal regions was opposite of the eastern/western coasts. On the other hand, the inland regions always had more severe drought conditions. Additionally, the validation results for the 1 km SMAP SM using International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) in situ data showed reliable accuracy and the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) ranged from 0.02 to 0.09 m(3)/m(3). Both SWDI and SMDI showed clear seasonal and interannual variability, and the drought conditions worsened in 2017-2019.

Moisture content in soil is generally interpreted on the basis electrical conductivity (EC), soil temperature and relative humidity (RH). However, validity of previous approaches to interpret moisture content in urban landscape was rarely investigated. There is a need to relate the moisture content with other parameters (EC, temperature and RH) to economize the sensor installation. This study aims to quantify the dynamics of the above-mentioned parameters in an urban green space, and to further develop correlations between moisture content and other parameters (EC, temperature and RH). An integrated field monitoring and statistical modelling approach were adopted to achieve the objective. Four distinct sites comprising treed (younger and mature tree), grassed and bare soil were selected for investigation. Field monitoring was conducted for two months to measure four parameters. This was followed by statistical modelling by artificial neural networks (ANN). Correlations were developed for estimating soil moisture as a function of other parameters for the selected sites. Irrespective of the type of site, EC was found to be the most significant parameter affecting soil moisture, followed by RH and soil temperature. This correlation with EC is found to be stronger in vegetated soil as compared to that without vegetation. The correlations of soil temperature with water content do not have a conclusive trend. A considerable increase in temperature was not found due to the subsequent drying of soil after rainfall. A normal distribution function was found from the uncertainty analysis of soil moisture in the case of treed soil, whereas soil moisture was observed to follow a skewed distribution in the bare and grassed soils.},

Excessive use of groundwater and aquifers and lack of optimal cultivation patterns decrease soil fluidity, leading to land subsidence, increased soil salinity, and reduced surface moisture and soil moisture to a depth of 1-2 m. The subsidence phenomenon also disrupts water storage in underground aquifers, making it difficult to reduce the volume of the reservoir and break the soil layers and fill the pores of the water sediment into the lower layers, and store water in the reservoirs. It cannot reach the underground, which is one of the main reasons for the decrease in soil moisture and the increase in soil salinity. In this study, the changes in the land subsidence during the 2014-2020 time period, were evaluated by Sentinel-1 satellite imagery and SNAP software. The soil electrical conductivity, soil surface moisture content, and soil moisture content in the depth of 1-2 m were calculated by Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, Landsat 8 satellite, and FLDAS data in the GEE platform, respectively. The results showed that the increase in land subsidence has raised soil salinity covering area and its intensity. As a result, moisture reduction is observed in different depths in recent years.},

Significant advances of this ICE-LC design are extending typical LC sensor read range over a meter and reducing positional alignment sensitivity between reader and sensor. An analytical model validates the working principle and feasibility of the ICE-LC system. Prototypes of the ICE-LC sensor were built and optimized in terms of sensitivity and power transfer (single and four turns for ICE top and bottom coils, respectively). Soil moisture tests validated the ICE-LC improvements on minimized positional alignment sensitivity and extended read range, transducing a decrease in resonant frequency with increasing soil moisture. When calibrating with existing wired approaches, the ICE-LC sensor had a reproducible, linear sensor gain of 4.52\%moisture content/MHz with an R-2 of 0.745 and RMSE of 2.41\%. A smaller, planar form factor of the ICE-LC sensor was also tested and exhibited reduced positional alignment sensitivity between reader and sensor at shorter read ranges. This initial study demonstrates the feasibility of the ICE-LC resonant sensor as a cost-effective method to monitor soil moisture content throughout the growing season at many field locations.(c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {Land surface models have facilitated the estimation of soil moisture over a range of spatiotemporal scales. However, limitations in model parameterization and under-representation of anthropogenic processes restrict their ability to estimate local-scale soil moisture variability, especially over irrigated areas. Assimilation of satellite-based soil moisture retrievals into land surface models can be a viable approach to overcome these constraints, specially over highly irrigated countries such as India, where such applications are rare. Additionally, large-scale validation of modeled soil moisture has been limited over India till now due to lack of a representative station network. By assimilating Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP)-based estimates into the state-of-the-art Indian Land Data Assimilation System (ILDAS) and combining with a new soil moisture station network of more than 200 stations, this study demonstrates improved soil moisture estimations and capture of irrigation signals over the region. The Noah-MP land surface model is forced by multiple local and global meteorological datasets and Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) is used for assimilation of soil moisture. Comparison of open-loop and data assimilated soil moisture against station soil moisture data shows relative spatial mean improvement of 0.0178 in correlation and 0.0029 m3/m3 in RMSE. Further statistical comparison with in-situ data has also shown better results over most of the stations, as evident from improved correlations and reduced unbiased RMSE after assimilation. Finally, the climatology of soil moisture over the different irrigation fractions reveals that data assimilated outputs over irrigated grid cells tend to have higher soil moisture during dry winter season, demonstrating the ability to capture irrigation signals. These findings quantify the value of data assimilation in improving soil moisture estimates and the ability to capture unmodeled processes such as irrigation, which lays the science groundwork for upcoming space missions such as NASA ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR).},

Data Assimilation (DA) has been recognized as an effective means to incorporate such observations into hydrologic models to better predict and forecast hydroclimatic variables. In this study, we use a recently developed Evolutionary Particle Filter with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (EPFM) approach to assimilate Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture data into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrologic model to provide more reliable topsoil layer moisture (0 similar to-5 cm) over the entire Continental United States (CONUS). The EPFM outperformed an Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) in terms of correlations and the unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) with in situ mea-surements from the Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) and the United States Climate Reference Network (USCRN). Also, we used a multivariate probability distribution based on a Copula function to integrate the posterior soil moisture, precipitation (from the North American Land Data Assimilation System (NLDAS)) and evapotranspiration (from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) information to develop a new integrated drought index, i.e. SPESMI. To validate the usefulness of the developed integrated drought index, we compared the drought events detected by this index with those reported by the United States Drought Monitor (USDM). The results indicated a strong temporal consistency of the drought areas detected by our approach and the USDM over the entire period of study (April 2015 to June 2018). In addition to such promising results, we noticed that our approach could capture the flash drought in 2017 in the U.S. Northern Plains earlier than the USDM, and could identify some severe to extreme drought events that had been underestimated by the USDM. Moreover, the SPESMI has a high correlation with the yield loss of spring and winter wheat in the United States. This novel drought monitoring framework can serve as an independent and potentially complementary drought monitoring system.},

Considering the spatial distribution of soil water content, the border effect in relation to crop growth, and the lateral seepage of soil water, we sought to study and optimize the area and specifications of irrigation experiment plots with different levels and replicates. The results show that the experimental irrigation plot consisted of two parts-the core area and the guard area. The most suitable area for the experiment plot core area, with a single level and without replicates, was 60-80 m2. The core experimental area can be arranged with two replicates per 40 m2, with differences in soil moisture content between the treatments reaching more than 15\% at the two experiment levels. Each plot comprised two replicates, or if they were 20 m2, then they contained three replicates; when the soil moisture contents differed between 10\% and 15\%, the area of each replicate plot was 80 m2, comprising two replicates, or 30 m2 with three replicates. When the difference in soil moisture content between the treatments exceeded 15\% with the three experimental levels, the area of each plot was 30 m2 and they contained two replicates, or 20 m2 containing three replicates; at differences of 10\% to 15\%, each replicate plot was 50 m2 containing two replicates, or 30 m2 with three replicates. The experimental plots were rectangular, with irrigation furrows dug lengthwise; therefore, the plots had aspect ratios between 7:1 and 5:1. The width of the buffer area was over 60 cm. The effect of the border on plant height and LAI for winter wheat primarily emerged with one to three rows (20-60 cm) at the jointing stage, while the effect on grain yield and biomass in winter wheat mainly emerged with one to two rows (20-40 cm). The conclusions of this research will inform the development of surface irrigation methods for silt loam in northern Henan, as a reference for optimizing experiment plots employing border irrigation with different soil textures.},

	abstract = {Deforestation continues to be extensive in the tropics, resulting in reduced soil water content. Reforestation is an effective way to recover soil water content, but the recovery depends on the type of reforestation efforts that are implemented. Monoculture of fast-growing species is a common reforestation strategy, because it is an effective means of preventing landslides resulting from the frequent typhoons and heavy rains in the tropics and easy to implement. To quantify whether monoculture plantings can help recover soil water content, we initiated a reforestation project within a 0.2 km(2) area of an extremely degraded tropical monsoon forest. We hypothesized that much higher transpiration rate of fast-growing tree species would deplete soil water more than the dominant slow-growing species in the adjacent secondary tropical rain forest during both wet and dry seasons, thereby resulting in much lower soil water content. To test this hypothesis, we compared transpiration rates and key functional traits that can distinguish transpiration rates between fast-growing and dominant slow-growing species in both wet and dry seasons. We also quantified whether soil water content around these species differed. We found that fast-growing species had transpiration rate and transpiration-related trait values that were 5-10 times greater than the dominant slow-growing species in both seasons. We also found that soil water content around dominant slow-growing species was 1.5-3 times greater than for fast-growing species in both seasons. Therefore, reforestation based on monoculture plantings of fast-growing species seems difficult to effectively recover the soil water content. We also provide a simple method for guiding the use of reforestation efforts to recover soil water content in extremely degraded tropical rain forests. We expect that this simple method can be an effective means to restore extremely degraded tropical rain forests in other parts of the world.},

	abstract = {Irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of fresh water resources. Most countries do not have a precise measurement of water consumption for irrigation. In this study, an innovative approach is proposed that allows for estimation of irrigation water use at the catchment scale based on satellite soil moisture data. To this end, the SM2RAIN algorithm, which had been originally developed for estimation of rainfall from the soil moisture observations, is adopted. The satellite soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) along with different rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET) products in the period 2012-2015 are used as the input to the model. The methodology is tested in the agricultural plains of southern Urmia Lake, which is one of the main agricultural plains in Iran for which actual irrigation data is available. The results reveal that the proposed approach can capture the overall irrigation pattern, although; it is systematically overestimating irrigation volume compared to observed irrigation data. Thus the bias is calculated over largely non-irrigated pixels and used to modify the model estimates. The bias-corrected results show good agreement with the in situ irrigation data. In particular, the average model performance in the irrigated pixels in terms of R and RMSE (mm/month) are (0.86 and 12.895) respectively. Accuracy varied depending on the inputs, with improvement in order of 11\% and 42\% in R and RMSE depending on the inputs chosen. The method is also applied to less irrigated areas that result in obtaining significantly lower irrigation rates. The low spatial resolution of soil moisture products (i.e. similar to 50 km) makes it difficult to capture the irrigation water of small irrigated croplands. Unreliable rainfall and ET data can also lead to the over/underestimation of irrigation. In spite of the above limitations (particularly lack of reliable ET dataset), the proposed model can still capture the irrigation pattern, given that strong soil moisture signal from irrigation is detected by the satellite.},

AE values were observed to be high ({\textgreater}1) in the northern regions of Pakistan indicating the dominance of fine mode particles during the winter season. Moreover, AOD showed a positive correlation with Relative Humidity (RH), Evapotranspiration, Wind speed (WS), and Temperature. On the other hand, it showed a negative correlation with Soil moisture (SM), Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and precipitation over Pakistan.

MODIS surface reflectance products (MOD09A1) and Sentinel-2 multispectral imager Level-1C data were utilized to calculate the optical SM indexes. The evaluation results demonstrated that (1) the Visible and Shortwave Infrared Drought Index (VSDI) and Optical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) outperform the other eleven optical SM indexes as compared with aircraft and in situ observed SM. They also presented well consistence in temporal variation with the in situ observed SM. (2) The VSDI achieved comparable performance with the OPTRAM while the former has very simple calculation expression and the latter requires complex process to determine the dry and wet boundaries. (3) Both the VSDI and OPTRAM utilize two sensitive bands of soil and vegetation moisture, i.e., Red and SWIR bands, whereas the other eleven SM indexes only employ one sensitive band. This may be the main reason of the evaluation results. (4) Based on this recognition, improvements of the VSDI and OPTRAM were created and validated in this study through adding more sensitive band to VSDI and combining NDVI and modified VSDI into a new feature space for calculating the optical SM index as with OPTRAM.

With the development of the digital information industry, smart agriculture has become a new trend in agricultural development and there is increasing demand for efficiently and intelligently acquiring good soil quality information. Scientists worldwide have developed many remote sensing quantitative inversion models, which need to be systematized and intelligent for agricultural personnel to enjoy the dividends of information technology such as 3S (remote sensing, geographic information system, and global navigation satellite system) techniques. Accordingly, to meet the need of farmers, agricultural managers, and agricultural researchers to acquire timely information on regional soil quality, in this paper, we designed a cloud platform for inversion analysis of moisture, nutrient, salinity, and other important soil quality indicators. The platform was developed using ArcGIS (The software is produced by the Environmental Systems Research Institute, Inc. of America in Redlands, CL, USA) and GeoScene (The software is produced by GeoScene Information Technology Co.,Ltd., Beijing, China) software, with Java and JavaScript as programing languages and SQL Server as the database management system with a PC client, a web client, and a mobile app. On the basis of the existing quantitative remote sensing models, the platform realizes mapping functions, intelligent inversion of soil moisture-nutrient-salinity (SMNS) content, data analysis mining, soil knowledge base, platform management, and so on. It can help different users acquire, manage, and analyze data and make decisions based on the data. In addition, the platform can customize model parameters according to regional characteristics, improving analysis accuracy and expanding the application area. Overall, the platform employs 3S techniques, Internet technology, and mobile communication technology synthetically and realizes intelligent inversion and decision analysis of significant soil quality information, such as moisture-nutrient-salinity content. This platform has been applied to the analysis of soil indicators in several areas and has produced good operational results and benefits. This study will enable rapid data analysis and provide technical support for regional agriculture production, contributing to the development of smart agriculture.},

Two key problems must be addressed in the process of downscaling soil moisture: the selection of the downscaling method and the determination of the environmental variables, namely, the influencing factors of soil moisture. This study attempted to utilize machine learning and data mining algorithms to downscale the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km and compared the advantages and disadvantages of the random forest model and the Cubist algorithm to determine the more suitable soil moisture downscaling method for the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MLRYRB). At present, either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or a digital elevation model (DEM) is selected as the environmental variable for the downscaling models. In contrast, variables, such as albedo and evapotranspiration, are infrequently applied; nevertheless, this study selected these two environmental variables, which have a considerable impact on soil moisture. Thus, the selected environmental variables in the downscaling process included the longitude, latitude, elevation, slope, NDVI, daytime and nighttime land surface temperature (LST\_D and LST\_N, respectively), albedo, evapotranspiration (ET), land cover (LC) type, and aspect. This study achieved downscaling on a 16-day timescale based on Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. A comparison of the random forest model with the Cubist algorithm revealed that the R-2 of the random forest-based downscaling method is higher than that of the Cubist algorithm-based method by 0.0161; moreover, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is reduced by 0.0006 and the mean absolute error (MAE) is reduced by 0.0014. Testing the accuracies of these two downscaling methods showed that the random forest model is more suitable than the Cubist algorithm for downscaling AMSR-E soil moisture data from 25 km to 1 km in the MLRYRB, which provides a theoretical basis for obtaining high spatial resolution soil moisture data.},

We present results exploring the potential for NWM soil moisture and streamflow analyses to inform operational drought monitoring. Both agricultural and hydrologic drought monitoring rely either explicitly or implicitly on an accurate representation of anomalous soil moisture values. Much of our analysis focuses on comparisons of soil moisture anomalies in the NWM to those from in-situ observations. To establish benchmarks for NWM soil moisture skill, we also include other gridded data sets currently used to inform the US Drought Monitor, specifically those from the North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) land surface models. We then compare NWM streamflow low flows with similar to 500 stream gauges from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hydro-Climatic Data Network of undisturbed basins. The NWM soil moisture simulation's skill parallels that from NLDAS-2. The accuracy of drought condition identification from NWM streamflow exceeds that based on soil moisture as determined by Critical Success Index scores for extreme dry percentiles. Different meteorological forcings are used in the operational NWM cycles than those used in this retrospective analysis. This forcing disconnect, together with concerns about current-generation land surface model soil moisture-transport schemes, inhibit its current operational use for drought monitoring. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Model offers output relevant for drought monitoring. This paper evaluates the National Water Model soil moisture and streamflow with drought applications in mind, and compares those evaluations to other modeling tools currently used to inform drought monitoring. We find the model's ability to estimate anomalous low flows exceeds its ability to estimate anomalously dry soils, and discuss its current potential to inform operational drought monitoring. Retrospective NOAA National Water Model soil moisture and streamflow were evaluated for drought-monitoring applications The National Water Model was comparable in skill to land model guidance currently used to inform the US drought monitor The National Water Model's operational forcing strategy currently limits its application for real-time drought monitoring},

Thus, a national strategy is needed to guide network deployment, sustainable network operation, data integration and dissemination, and user-focused product development. The National Coordinated Soil Moisture Monitoring Network (NCSMMN) is a federally led, multi-institution effort that aims to address these needs by capitalizing on existing wide-ranging soil moisture monitoring activities, increasing the utility of observational data, and supporting their strategic application to the full range of decision-making needs. The goals of the NCSMMN are to 1) establish a national “network of networks” that effectively demonstrates data integration and operational coordination of diverse in situ networks; 2) build a community of practice around soil moisture measurement, interpretation, and application-a “network of people” that links data providers, researchers, and the public; and 3) support research and development (R\&D) on techniques to merge in situ soil moisture data with remotely sensed and modeled hydrologic data to create user-friendly soil moisture maps and associated tools. The overarching mission of the NCSMMN is to provide coordinated high-quality, nationwide soil moisture information for the public good by supporting applications like drought and flood monitoring, water resource management, agricultural and forestry planning, and fire danger ratings.},

Studies showed that soil solarization increases the total population of soil microorganisms by 477 (no.g(-1)soil) and improves soil fertility by 16\%, reduce weed infestations and soil borne diseases by 90 and 80\% respectively in drylands, thereby it gives a yield advantage of 17.42 t ha(-1) than unsalaried soil. Solarization is economically profitable and gives a return investment of 56\% per year. It is more sounding with prior irrigation and biodegradable plastic films during hot seasons of dryland areas. This technology is safe, affordable, effective and sustainable crop protection and soil fertility enhancing strategy.},

	abstract = {Climatology (mean seasonal cycle) errors often cause large differences between soil moisture products. However, relatively little work has been done to objectively evaluate soil moisture mean seasonal cycle (SMC) information acquired from different sources. This study evaluates surface (0-10 cm) SMCs obtained from four land surface models (LSMs), two C/X-band and two L-band remote-sensing (RS) products using 5 dense networks and 75 sparse in-situ soil moisture measurement sites located within the contiguous United States. Results show that relative to older C/X-band products derived from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for EOS (AMSR-E), newer L-band products derived from the Soil Moisture Ocean and Salinity (SMOS) mission provide more accurate SMC estimates (with an average of 35\% root-mean-square-error reduction). In fact, the latest SMOS INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC) product provides SMC intra-seasonal variability and dynamic range information that is 3-34\% and 2-37\% more accurate, respectively, than all four LSM-based SMCs examined here. Hence, SMC validation against SMOS-IC SMC results may improve LSMs' ability to accurately capture SMC characteristics, and the common strategy of scaling remote sensing SMC information to match LSM SMC estimates is likely sub-optimal for assimilating L-band soil moisture retrievals. Although the SMOS-IC product has made significant progresses towards retrieving absolute soil moisture values, a temporally constant dry bias is found in SMOS-IC surface SMCs over all land cover types. Addressing this bias should be a priority for future generations of SMOS retrieval algorithms.},

This study focuses on the recent CYGNSS Level 3 soil moisture data derived from the NASA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS), notable for its wide coverage and rapid revisit times, yet underexplored in drought research. Spanning from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2022, this research analyzed daily CYGNSS soil moisture data, comparing them with the ERA5, SMAP, and GLDAS-NOAH datasets. It was found that the average and standard deviation (std) of CYGNSS soil moisture exhibited spatial patterns largely similar to other datasets, although some regions showed discrepancies (std differences reached up to 0.05 in some regions). The correlation coefficients and RMSE values between CYGNSS and other datasets depended on climate and land cover types. Four drought indicators from different soil moisture datasets were compared with the improved monthly Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). The drought indicators based on CYGNSS data demonstrate the capacity to describe drought extent and intensity. The correlation coefficients between certain drought indicators obtained from CYGNSS and SPEI reached 0.27 for drought percentage and 0.16 for drought intensity. Further investigations with selected extreme drought cases revealed that the indicator from CYGNSS data is relatively weak, influenced by the selected regions, times, and drought indicators. The results of this study provide insights into the potential application of CYGNSS soil moisture data in drought monitoring, offering a foundation for future research and practical implementation with current and future improved products.},

	abstract = {Accurate and timely prediction of soil moisture in orchards is crucial for making informed irrigation decisions at a regional scale. Conventional methods for monitoring soil moisture are often limited by high cost and disruption of soil structure, etc. However, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing, with high spatial and temporal resolutions, offers an effective alternative for monitoring regional soil moisture. In this study, multi-modal UAV remote sensing data, including RGB, thermal infrared (TIR), and multi-spectral (Mul) data, were acquired in citrus orchards. The correlations between different sensor data and soil moisture were analyzed to construct seven input combinations. Convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) models and a new hybrid model (CNN-LSTM), were employed to predict soil moisture at depths of 5 cm, 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm. Additionally, the impact of standalone sensor, texture features and multi-sensor data fusion on the accuracy of soil moisture prediction was explored. The results indicated that the model with RGB + Mul + TIR achieved the highest prediction accuracy, followed by those with Mul + TIR and RGB + Mul, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.80-0.88, 0.64-0.84, and 0.60-0.81, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging 2.46-2.99 m3 center dot m-3, 2.86-3.89 m3 center dot m- 3 and 3.15-4.25 m3 center dot m- 3, respectively. Among single sensor inputs, the Mul sensor data has the highest prediction accuracy, followed by TIR and RGB sensor, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.54-0.72, 0.36-0.52 and 0.14-0.26, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging 3.72-4.58 \%, 3.81-5.04 \% and 4.27-6.21 \%, respectively. The hybrid CNN-LSTM model exhibited the highest prediction accuracy, followed by CNN and LSTM models, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging 0.20-0.88, 0.16-0.83, and 0.14-0.81, and root mean square error (RMSE) ranging 2.46-5.01 m3 center dot m- 3, 2.68-5.35 m3 center dot m-3 and 2.81-6.21 m3 center dot m-3, respectively. The prediction accuracy of the models was the highest at the depth of 5 cm, followed by 10 cm, 20 cm and 40 cm, with the coefficient of determination (R2) average of 0.63, 0.62, 0.59, and 0.55, and root mean square error (RMSE) average of 3.70 m3 center dot m- 3, 3.79 m3 center dot m- 3, 3.85 m3 center dot m- 3 and 4.21 m3 center dot m- 3, respectively. Therefore, the hybrid CNN-LSTM model with RGB + Mul + TIR is recommended to predict soil moisture in citrus orchard.

	abstract = {High-resolution soil moisture (SM) products are crucial for managing water in agricultural regions, irrigation scheduling, and land-atmosphere model simulations. Most satellite-based SM products have spatial resolutions in the tens of kilometers, which cannot satisfy the aforementioned applications, and there is an urgent need to disaggregate them to fine spatial resolutions. Currently, disaggregation method based on multi-source data fusion tend to be robust, but the following difficulties remain: 1) satellite products (microwave, optical/infrared) are somewhat missing in space and time which hinder the applications; 2) only one model-based product is used in the fusion process and different model-based products were not sufficiently evaluated. To overcome these problems, this work developed an SM disaggregation methodology. The best model-based SM product was first assessed using the triple collocation (TC) method, which allows us to obtain the weight of individual product. The model-based and microwave SM products were combined based on weight to produce daily seamless SM data at 25 km. Second, the iterative multi-temporal reconstruction and the ESTARFM method were combined to solve the invalid grids problem of optical/infrared product, thus obtaining 1 km daily seamless auxiliary data. Finally, daily seamless SM data at 1 km were obtained by geographically weighted regression (GWR) method. The methodology proposed in this study had a well-defined mechanism, and the resulting SM product achieved a satisfied accuracy (ubRMSE = 0.044 m3/m3), with characteristics of spatiotemporal continuity as well as fine spatial detail. The disaggregated SM product makes full use of model-based, microwave, and optical/infrared products, which is valuable in areas such as agricultural management policy, high-resolution hydro-meteorological simulations, and disaster monitoring.},

	abstract = {Drone multispectral technology enables the real-time monitoring and analysis of soil moisture across vast agricultural lands. overcoming the time-consuming, labor-intensive, and spatial discontinuity constraints of traditional methods. This study establishes a rapid inversion model for deep soil moisture (0-200 cm) in dryland agriculture using data from drone-based multispectral remote sensing. Maize, millet, sorghum, and potatoes were selected for this study, with multispectral data, canopy leaf, and soil moisture content at various depths collected every 3 to 6 days. Vegetation indices highly correlated with crop canopy leaf moisture content (p {\textless} 0.01) and were identified using Pearson correlation analysis, leading to the development of linear and nonlinear regression models for predicting moisture content in canopy leaves and soil. The results show a significant linear correlation between the predicted and actual canopy leaf moisture levels for the four crops, according to the chosen vegetation indices. The use of canopy leaf moisture content to predict surface soil moisture (0-20 cm) demonstrated enhanced accuracy. The models designed for the top 20 cm of soil moisture successfully estimated deep soil moisture levels (up to 200 cm) for all four crops. The 20 cm range soil moisture model showed improvements over the 10 cm range model, with increases in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Coefficient of Determination (R-2), and Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency Coefficient (NSE) by 0.4, 0.8, 0.73, and 0.34, respectively, in the corn area; 0.28, 0.69, 0.48, and 0.25 in the millet area; 0.4, 0.48, 0.22, and 0.52 in the sorghum area; and 1.14, 0.81, 0.73, and 0.56 in the potato area, all with an average Relative Error (RE) of less than 10\% across the crops. Using drone-based multispectral technology, this study forecasts leaf water content via vegetation index analysis, facilitating swift and effective soil moisture inversion. This research introduces a novel method for monitoring and managing agricultural water resources, providing a scientific basis for precision farming and moisture variation monitoring in dryland areas.},

Based on the principle of cumulative distribution function matching, this study proposed a continuous relationship establishment algorithm for multisource remote sensing soil moisture data. Using this new algorithm, soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Climate Change Initiative (CCI) satellite data from the Songnen Plain as test data were fused to a long time series product of real-time remote sensing soil moisture data. This application validation of this new method to SMOS and CCI indicated that this Lagrange interpolation continuous fusion algorithm could improve the fusion accuracy of multisource remote sensing soil moisture data significantly. The low -value region of the cumulative probability distribution curve is a crucial data segment for characterization of agricultural drought. Through implementation of the proposed continuous fusion algorithm, fused SMOS and CCI data were found to have high coincidence at each quantile in the low -value region of the curve.},

However, traditional GNSS-interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) soil moisture retrieval methods generally utilize a single frequency or single satellite, which fail to take full advantage of different and complementary of satellite signals with different frequencies. An improved algorithm for soil moisture retrieval based on principal component analysis (PCA) and entropy method using multi-frequency amplitude and phase offset fusion data was proposed in this research. The performance of the proposed soil moisture retrieval method was evaluated using data recorded by Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) H2O networks and a self-built site in Henan, China. The results from GPS and BeiDou both showed that the retrieved soil moisture has a stronger correlation with in situ soil moisture, which can better reflect the fluctuation of ground truth measurements. Compared with the traditional method, the retrieval accuracy of the proposed method in terms of root-mean-square error (RMSE) was improved by 50.93\%, and the average correlation coefficient were increased by 11.71\%. This research proved that the proposed method could effectively improve retrieval accuracy due to the increasing number of frequencies and tracks clustering. Moreover, this study has illustrated the feasibility of BeiDou signals to precisely estimate surface soil moisture.},

Prehistoric agriculturalists (e.g., Ancestral Pueblo farmers) were dependent on having sufficient soil moisture for successful plant growth. To better understand the quality of farmland in terms of soil moisture, this study develops a static geospatial soil moisture model, the Soil Moisture Proxy Model, which uses soil and topographic variables to estimate soil moisture potential across a watershed. The model is applied to the semi-arid region of the Goodman watershed in the central Mesa Verde region of southwestern Colorado. We evaluate the model by comparing the Goodman watershed output to two other watersheds and to soil moisture sensor values. The simple framework can be used in other regions of the world, where water is also an important limiting factor for farming. The general outcome of this research is an improved understanding of potential farmland and human-environmental relationships across the local landscape.},

The results showed that spaceborne GNSS-R soil moisture sensitivity was very useful during seasonal changes in regional observation.

However, large parts of the deeper vadose zone remain outside of its observational window. Retrieving soil moisture information from these deeper layers requires extrapolation, modelling or other methods, all of which come with methodological challenges. Against this background, we investigate CRNS for downhole soil moisture measurements in deeper layers of the vadose zone. To render calibration with in situ soil moisture measurements unnecessary, we rescaled neutron intensities observed below the terrain surface with intensities measured above a waterbody. An experimental set-up with a CRNS sensor deployed at different depths of up to 10m below the surface in a groundwater observation well combined with particle transport simulations revealed the response of downhole thermal neutron intensities to changes in the soil moisture content at the depth of the downhole neutron detector as well as in the layers above it. The simulation results suggest that the sensitive measurement radius of several decimetres, which depends on soil moisture and soil bulk density, exceeds that of a standard active neutron probe (which is only about 30 cm). We derived transfer functions to estimate downhole neutron signals from soil moisture information, and we describe approaches for using these transfer functions in an inverse way to derive soil moisture from the observed neutron signals. The in situ neutron and soil moisture observations confirm the applicability of these functions and prove the concept of passive downhole soil moisture estimation, even at larger depths, using cosmicray neutron sensing.},

Spectral variability, caused by variations in viewing and illumination angle and between-sensor variability, further complicates the estimation. In this work, we developed a supervised methodology to accurately estimate SMC from spectral reflectance. The method determines a proxy for the SMC of moist soil, making use of the reflectance spectra of an air-dried and saturated soil sample. The proxy is made invariant to illumination and viewing angle, and sensor type. In the next step, the proxy is normalized with respect to the ground-truth SMC of the saturated soil to make the technique less dependent on the soil type. The normalized proxy can be directly used as an estimate of SMC. Alternatively, the nonlinear relationship between the normalized proxy and the actual SMC can be learned by supervised regression. Experiments are conducted on real moist soil data. In particular, we developed datasets of moist minerals, acquired by two different sensors, an Agrispec spectrometer and an Imec snapscan shortwave infrared (SWIR) hyperspectral camera, under strictly controlled experimental settings. The proposed methodology is also validated on the available real moist soil data from the literature. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method accurately estimates the SMC.},

The high-resolution capability of GNSS-R complements traditional satellite-based active and passive missions but the product reliability and robustness evaluations are still absent due to an efficient retrieval algorithms. In this study, we addressed this lack of reliability and robustness by comprehensively assessing the SSM retrievals from CYclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data with the satellite-based microwave radiometry products Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA2) over Punjab in various seasons. ERA5 model-based products for the same period in 2022-2023. Our study reveals a distinct seasonal average SSM variation during autumn (0.20 cm3/cm3), followed by winter values of 0.19 cm3/cm3. Subsequently, the minimum SSM values are observed during summer (0.11 cm3/cm3) and an increase in spring to 0.13 cm3/cm3. Moreover, a strong positive linear relationship (0.74) is evident between SMAP and ERRA 5 in contrast to a low correlation (0.03) between MERRA2 and both the SMAP and ERRA 5.

	abstract = {The US Army is required to be a good steward of the land per US Army regulation AR 200-1. Based on this regulation, Army installations need to manage lands, to reduce potential damage and impacts to water quality and habitat that may occur from training. Maneuver training does impact the vegetation and soil and this damage is directly related to soil moisture. Soil moisture is an important factor for understanding the potential for soil surface disturbance due to vehicle impacts and predicting soil resilience to vehicle traffic, however, producing accurate estimates of the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture has historically been elusive. GeoWATCH, which stands for Geospatial Weather-Affected Terrain Conditions and Hazards (formerly DASSP), simulates soil moisture world-wide, at relatively small spatial and temporal scales. GeoWATCH uses a physics-based downscaling approach that uses weather-scale land surface model estimates of soil moisture and land surface water and energy fluxes, with high resolution geospatial data. GeoWATCH soil moisture outputs coupled with vehicle impact models, are anticipated to be useful for near-real-time estimation of ground disturbance, but will require ground validation. To validate GeoWATCH soil moisture estimates, we utilized Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN) gauge network soil moisture data from 127 sites across 34 states. Statistical analysis of the raw GeoWATCH output indicated the model performs statistically better in certain soil textures. Model bias is largest for sandy soils, whereas clayey soils were least biased. As a result, bias correction models were applied to the raw GeoWATCH simulated values using linear regression to predict correction factor (CF) values based on physical site characteristics. The bias correction models significantly improved the performance of the GeoWATCH soil moisture model in terms of average performance statistics and number of statistically cally unbiased sites. This process could easily be incorporated into GeoWATCH, allowing for a capability to rapidly estimate vehicle impacts and determine rehabilitation requirements by installation land managers.

	abstract = {Featured Application The proposed approach for estimating reference evapotranspiration allows obtaining accurate approximations of this important crop parameter in an inexpensive way by using moisture sensors, which can be translated to an optimization of water resources. Abstract One of the most important applications of remote imaging systems in agriculture, with the greatest impact on global sustainability, is the determination of optimal crop irrigation. The methodology proposed by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is based on estimating crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is done by computing the reference crop evapotranspiration (ETo) multiplied by a crop coefficient (Kc). Some previous works proposed methods to compute Kc using remote crop images. The present research aims at complementing these systems, estimating ETo with the use of soil moisture sensors. A crop of kikuyu grass (Pennisetum clandestinum) was used as the reference crop. Four frequency-domain reflectometry sensors were installed, gathering moisture information during the study period from May 2015 to September 2016. Different machine learning regression algorithms were analyzed for the estimation of ETo using moisture and climatic data. The values were compared with respect to the ETo computed in an agroclimatic station using the Penman-Monteith method. The best method was the randomizable filtered classifier technique, based on the K* algorithm. This model achieved a correlation coefficient, R, of 0.9936, with a root-mean-squared error of 0.183 mm/day and 6.52\% mean relative error; the second-best model used artificial neural networks, with an R of 0.9470 and 11\% relative error. Thus, this new methodology allows obtaining accurate and cost-efficient prediction models for ETo, as well as for the water balance of the crops.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays a vital role in high agriculture yield and many satellite products are available to study their potentiality in soil moisture estimation. Hence, we considered a triangular network method based on MODIS products for soil moisture estimation. The reflectance data of MODIS was used to derive NDVI at 250 m and surface temperature was downscaled from 1 km to 250 m using TsHARP and TPS models. Furthermore, we have explored the applicability of the TVDI at 250 m spatial resolution to capture daily soil moisture. TVDI and in-situ soil moisture has high negative correlation (R2 = -0.80). The results show that the TVDI value on 19 January 2013 was highly co-related with in-situ soil moisture on 19 January 2013. The TVDI value after irrigation of second week of February 2013 was lower than for periods of no irrigation month (January). Therefore, mapping of soil moisture under crop condition can be possible with TVDI and satellite data input.},

	doi = {10.5194/hess-24-1859-2020},
	abstract = {Interception is the storage and subsequent evaporation of rainfall by above-ground structures, including canopy and groundcover vegetation and surface litter. Accurately quantifying interception is critical for understanding how ecosystems partition incoming precipitation, but it is difficult and costly to measure, leading most studies to rely on modeled interception estimates. Moreover, forest interception estimates typically focus only on canopy storage, despite the potential for substantial interception by groundcover vegetation and surface litter. In this study, we developed an approach to quantify “total” interception (i.e., including forest canopy, understory, and surface litter layers) using measurements of shallow soil moisture dynamics during rainfall events. Across 34 pine and mixed forest stands in Florida (USA), we used soil moisture and precipitation (P) data to estimate interception storage capacity (beta(s)), a parameter required to estimate total annual interception (I-a) relative to P. Estimated values for beta(s)(mean beta(s) = 0.30 cm; 0.01 {\textless}= beta(s) {\textless}= 0.62 cm) and I-a/P (mean I-a/P = 0.14; 0.06 {\textless}= I-a/P {\textless}= 0.21) were broadly consistent with reported literature values for these ecosystems and were significantly predicted by forest structural attributes (leaf area index and percent ground cover) as well as other site variables (e.g., water table depth). The best-fit model was dominated by LAI and explained nearly 80 \% of observed beta(s) variation. These results suggest that whole-forest interception can be estimated using near-surface soil moisture time series, though additional direct comparisons would further support this assertion. Additionally, variability in interception across a single forest type underscores the need for expanded empirical measurement. Potential cost savings and logistical advantages of this proposed method relative to conventional, labor-intensive interception measurements may improve empirical estimation of this critical water budget element.},

	abstract = {Reliable soil moisture information is vital for optimal irrigation management, farm-level agronomic decision-making, hydrologic studies, and cropping systems modeling. A wide range of soil moisture sensing technologies is commercially available, but their performance must be evaluated for diverse conditions of use. In this research, we investigated nine soil moisture sensors based on time-domain reflectometry, capacitance, and electrical resistance principles in production field conditions with two installation orientations, i.e., vertical (V) and horizontal (H), in two soils (silt loam and loamy sand) and two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Performance parameters deduced from the 2017 datasets revealed that sensor type and soil type significantly affected the soil moisture sensor performance under factory calibration (F.C.); however, sensor installation orientation did not. Thus, the sensors were only evaluated based on their performance in horizontal orientation in both soils. Precision and accuracy were considered targets to assist in appropriate sensor selection. To improve sensor accuracy, site-specific calibration (S.S.C.) functions were developed and validated using independent datasets from 2018. Considering mean bias error (MBE), all sensors overestimated volumetric soil water content (theta(v)) in both soils, with the exception of TEROS 21 (MPS-6) in silt loam and JD probe in loamy sand. On average, sensor performance was 67\% better in loamy sand than in silt loam. Overall, the sensors showed higher precision in silt loam (R-2 = 0.53 to 0.93) than in loamy sand (R-2 = 0.25 to 0.82). Substantial post-S.S.C. improvement (32\% to 89\%) was observed in all sensors' performance relative to F.C. in silt loam. In loamy sand, while most sensors performed reasonably well with F.C., considerable improvements (28\% to 85\%) were observed with S.S.C. Significant differences (p {\textless} 0.05) were observed in sensors' sensitivity to soil temperature (T-soil), which ranged from 14 degrees C to 23 degrees C in silt loam and from 14 degrees C to 25 degrees C loamy sand during the experiments. The CS655, 10HS, 5TE, and TEROS 21 (MPS-6) sensors showed significant (p {\textless} 0.05) sensitivity to T-soil fluctuations, with T-soil explaining a maximum of 17\% of the variance observed in sensor performance. No statistically significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05) sensitivity was detected for any of the sensors in loamy sand. TEROS 21 (MPS-6) had the highest sensitivity to T-soil with a slope of -4.25. In contrast, while statistically significant (p {\textless} 0.05), 5TE was the least sensitive to T-soil variability with a slope of 1.81. The information, data, and analyses presented here can be instrumental for informed sensor selection and use in decision-making in production fields with similar soil textures and soil water regimes.},

Spatiotemporally continuous satellite-derived SM information is urgently needed for large-scale meteorological and hydrological applications. This study proposes the application of a spatial gap-Idling method using an artificial neural network (ANN) to reconstruct missing records of daily surface SM from the Climate Change Initiative program of the European Space Agency (ESA CCI) in the growing seasons of 1982-2015 across China. Ten environmental variables were taken into consideration, including meteorological forcing, geographic and topographic features, vegetation conditions, and soil texture. The ANN-reconstructed SM and RF-reconstructed SM were validated using the ground-based observations and three global reanalysis SM datasets. The gap-filling results by the ANN model were compared to that by the original kriging (OK) model under three simulation scenarios: SM images with removed swaths, varying vegetation densities, and different percentages of data gaps. The results showed that the ANN-reconstructed SM was in good agreement with in-situ SM observations, with the CC more than 0.607 and the RMSE less than 0.074 m(3)/m(3) over the northwestern and eastern parts of China. Compared with the original ESA CCI SM, the ANN model performed better than the OK model in reconstructing SM with absent swaths and in densely and sparsely vegetated regions. Specifically, the ANN-reconstructed SM provided a higher estimation accuracy in regions with low-density vegetation than in those with high-density vegetation. The weaker performance may due to the complex interactions between surface SM and various environmental variables underneath the dense vegetation. In addition, the ANN model significantly outperformed the OK model by accurately estimating SM when the percentage of data gaps succeeded 40\%. Our study is valuable for providing an alternative reference to reconstruct satellite-derived SM and highlights the potential of using the ANN model. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

We found a model accuracy (RMSE) estimate of 0.002 cm-3 cm-3 and concordance of 0.96 were found. This result is averaged over this period but fluctuated daily, and related to rainfall patterns across the target farm, which were not directly incorporated into the modelling framework. As expected, incorporating prior estimates of soil moisture into the modelling framework contributed to very accurate estimates of real time available soil moisture.Conclusions This research promotes the importance of iterative improvements to the soil moisture monitoring system, particularly in areas of sensor recalibration and spatio-temporal modelling. We stress the need for a longer-term view and plan for ongoing maintenance and improvement of such systems in the emerging digital farming ecosystem.Implications The results of this research will be useful for researchers and practitioners involved in the design and implementation of on-farm soil monitoring systems. Soil moisture sensing enables precision capability to manage crop productivity. We designed and implemented a spatial, vertical and temporal model for mapping soil moisture at the farm level. Upscaling data from soil probes to the farm level provides better insights about fluxes of soil moisture. Our on-farm soil moisture monitoring system is modular, with each component that can be readily updated and improved.

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological, biogeochemical, and energy budgets of terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate soil moisture measurements in remote ecosystems such as the Amazon are difficult and limited because of logistical constraints. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors are widely used to monitor soil moisture and require calibration to convert the TDR's dielectric permittivity measurement (K-a) to volumetric water content (theta(v)). In this study, our objectives were to develop a field-based calibration of TDR sensors in an old-growth upland forest in the central Amazon, to evaluate the performance of the calibration, and then to apply the calibration to determine the dynamics of soil moisture content within a 14.2-m-deep vertical soil profile. Depth-specific TDR calibration using local soils in a controlled laboratory setting yielded a novel K-a-theta(v) third-degree polynomial calibration. The sensors were later installed to their specific calibration depth in a 14.2-m pit. The widely used K-a-theta(v) relationship (Topp model) underestimated the site-specific theta(v) by 22-42\%, indicating significant error in the model when applied to these well-structured, clay-rich tropical forest soils. The calibrated wet- and dry-season theta(v) data showed a variety of depth and temporal variations highlighting the importance of soil textural differentiation, root uptake depths, as well as event to seasonal precipitation effects. Data such as these are greatly needed for improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes within tropical forests and for improving models of these systems in the face of changing environmental conditions.},

Adequate spatiotemporal characterization of these attributes is fundamental to the successful development of strategies for variable rate application of fertilizers, enabling the classic benefits of precision agriculture (PA). Studies on Brazilian soil have shown that at least 1 sample ha(-1) is required for the reliable mapping of key fertility attributes. However, this sampling density is difficult owing to the operational challenges of sample collection and the cost of laboratory analyses. Given this limitation, soil sensors have emerged as a practical and complementary technique for obtaining information on soil attributes, at high spatial density, without the production of chemical residues and at a reduced cost. Scientists worldwide have devoted their attention to the development and application of sensor systems for this purpose. The concept of proximal soil sensing (PSS) was established in 2011 and involves the application of soil sensors directly on the field. PSS techniques involve different disciplines, such as instrumentation, data science, geostatistics, and predictive modeling. The integration of these different disciplines has allowed successful sensor application for the spatial diagnosis of soil fertility attributes. The present work aimed to present a bibliographic review of the concepts involved and main techniques used in soil sensing to predict fertility attributes. We sought to present a broad view of the challenges, advances, and perspectives of sensor application in Brazilian tropical soils in the context of PA.},

	abstract = {Sensor data and agro-hydrological modeling have been combined to improve irrigation management. Crop water models simulating crop growth and production in response to the soil-water environment need to be parsimonious in terms of structure, inputs and parameters to be applied in data scarce regions. Irrigation management using soil moisture sensors requires them to be site-calibrated, low-cost, and maintainable. Therefore, there is a need for parsimonious crop modeling combined with low-cost soil moisture sensing without losing predictive capability. This study calibrated the low-cost capacitance-based Spectrum Inc. SM100 soil moisture sensor using multiple least squares and machine learning models, with both laboratory and field data. The best calibration technique, field-based piece-wise linear regression (calibration r2 = 0.76, RMSE = 3.13 \%, validation r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), was used to study the effect of sensor calibration on the performance of the FAO AquaCrop Open Source (AquaCrop-OS) model by calibrating its soil hydraulic parameters. This approach was tested during the wheat cropping season in 2018, in Kanpur (India), in the Indo-Gangetic plains, resulting in some best practices regarding sensor calibration being recommended. The soil moisture sensor was calibrated best in field conditions against a secondary standard sensor (UGT GmbH. SMT100) taken as a reference (r2 = 0.67, RMSE = 4.57 \%), followed by laboratory calibration against gravimetric soil moisture using the dry -down (r2 = 0.66, RMSE = 5.26 \%) and wet-up curves respectively (r2 = 0.62, RMSE = 6.29 \%). Moreover, model overfitting with machine learning algorithms led to poor field validation performance. The soil moisture simulation of AquaCrop-OS improved significantly by incorporating raw reference sensor and calibrated low-cost sensor data. There were non-significant impacts on biomass simulation, but water productivity improved significantly. Notably, using raw low-cost sensor data to calibrate AquaCrop led to poorer performances than using the literature. Hence using literature values could save sensor costs without compromising model performance if sensor calibration was not possible. The results suggest the essentiality of calibrating lowcost soil moisture sensors for crop modeling calibration to improve crop water productivity.},

We used input features to train, validate, and test the performance of the feed-forward ANN model in a 60:10:30 ratio, respectively. We compared the performance of ANN model with ten different machine learning algorithms [i.e., Generalised Regression Neural Network (GRNN), Radial Basis Network (RBN), Exact RBN (ERBN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Regression (SVR), Random Forest (RF), Boosting Ensemble Learning (Boosting EL), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Binary Decision Tree (BDT), and Automated Machine Learning (AutoML)].

Finally, for an unbiased and robust conclusion, we performed spatial distribution analysis by creating thirty different sets of training-validation-testing datasets.

The objectives of this manuscript are to describe a sensor-based irrigation scheduling method and review its effects on water applied and crop productivity. The effects of scheduling irrigation based on the recommended construction, deployment, and utilization of the WATERMARK 200SS granular matrix (WATERMARK) sensor on water applied, crop productivity, and crop water use efficiency were reviewed for corn (Zea mays L.), soybean [Glycine max L. (Merr.)], peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) produced in the Prairie region of Arkansas and the Delta regions of Arkansas and Mississippi. For corn and soybean, on-farm research indicates the recommended irrigation threshold of -85 to -100 cbar reduces total water applied up to 40\% while maintaining or improving yield up to 3\%, net returns up to \$39 acre(-1), and irrigation water use efficiency up to 51\% for soil textures ranging from very fine sandy loam to clay. Similarly, for peanut and cotton, results indicate the irrigation threshold that minimizes water use while maximizing yield and net returns is -50 cbar and -100 cbar, respectively. The recommended method for scheduling irrigations with a WATERMARK 200SS soil moisture sensor promotes the efficient use of water in row-crop production systems common to the mid-southern USA.},

	abstract = {Reanalysis soil moisture products are valuable for diverse applications, but their quality assessment is limited due to scale discrepancies when compared to traditional in situ point-scale measurements. The emergence of cosmic ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) with field-scale soil moisture estimates ( similar to 250 m radius, up to 0.7 m deep) is more suitable for the product evaluation owing to their larger footprint. In this study, we perform a comprehensive evaluation of eight widely used reanalysis soil moisture products (ERA5-Land, CFSv2, MERRA2, JRA55, GLDAS-Noah, CRA40, GLEAM and SMAP L4 datasets) against 135 CRNS sites from the COSMOS-UK, COSMOS-Europe, COSMOS USA and CosmOz Australia networks. We evaluate the products using six metrics capturing different aspects of soil moisture dynamics. Results show that all reanalysis products generally exhibit good temporal correlation with the measurements, with the median temporal correlation coefficient ( R ) values spanning 0.69 to 0.79, though large deviations are found at sites with seasonally varying vegetation cover. Poor performance is observed across products for soil moisture anomalies time series, with R values varying from 0.46 to 0.66. The performance of reanalysis products differs greatly across regions, climate, land covers and topographic conditions. In general, all products tend to overestimate data in arid climates and underestimate data in humid regions as well as grassland. Most reanalysis products perform poorly in steep terrain. Relatively low temporal correlation and high bias are detected in some sites from the west of the UK, which might be associated with relatively low bulk density and high soil organic carbon. Overall, ERA5-Land, CRA40, CFSv2, SMAP L4 and GLEAM exhibit superior performance compared to MERRA2, GLDAS-Noah and JRA55. We recommend that ERA5-Land and CFSv2 could be used in humid climates, whereas SMAP L4 and CRA40 perform better in arid regions. SMAP L4 has good performance for cropland, while GLEAM is more effective in shrubland regions. Our findings also provide insights into directions for improvement of soil moisture products for product developers.},

	abstract = {Monitoring soil moisture in real-time is an important parameter that helps farmers decide to enhance agriculture productivity and reduce resource wastage for better production and plant growth. In this work, we presented an easy-to-use and highly sensitive screen-printed flexible soil moisture sensor array to monitor soil moisture remotely for precision agriculture. The proposed sensor is based on a unique interdigitated electrode (IDE)-based capacitive structure with conductive carbon ink printed on a flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) substrate using the screen printing technique. Before soil moisture monitoring, the sensor is tested for humidity monitoring in an environmental chamber. A response of -144-1760 pF for 20-100\%RH with 10\%RH variation is observed for a single sensor, while an array configuration ranges from -127-1802 pF. The sensor response is observed for a temperature range from 20 to 50 `C. The sensor's sensitivity for relative humidity sensing is 19.123\%pF/RH, and the response and recovery time are -3.3 s and -4.2 s. Further, the sensor is tested for soil moisture sensing, as moisture content is gradually added to the completely dry soil. A highly sensitive response for soil moisture content (MC) with a -40.7\%pF/MC sensitivity is obtained. The sensor data is transmitted wirelessly using a Bluetooth module. The sensor is supported by a wooden stick, which illustrates the capabilities of biodegradability, the sensor is cost-effective and provides a real-time measurement for soil moisture. The sensors have the potential to provide maintenance-free monitoring, facilitating precise control of irrigation practices in precision agriculture. With their affordability and ability to operate on a large scale, the sensor offers promising opportunities for enhancing irrigation systems.},

We propose two complementary strategies for estimation of evapotranspiration rates and root water uptake profiles from soil-moisture sensor-array data. One is our implementation of ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); it treats the evapotranspiration sink term in the Richards equation, rather than soil moisture, as the observable to update. The other is a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) applied to the same observable; it is supplemented with the Fisher information matrix to quantify uncertainty in its predictions. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of these techniques. We found our EnKF implementation to be two orders of magnitude faster than either the standard EnKF or MLE, and our MLE procedure to require an order of magnitude fewer iterations to converge than its counterpart applied to soil moisture. These findings render our methodologies a viable and practical tool for estimation of the root water uptake profiles and evaporation rates, with the MLE technique to be used when the prior knowledge about evapotranspiration at the site is elusive.},

	abstract = {Preventing soil nitrogen (N) losses driven by microbial nitrification and denitrification contributes to improving global environmental concerns caused by NO3  -N leaching and N2O emission. Quorum sensing (QS) signals regulate nitrification and denitrification of N-cycling bacteria in pure culture and water treatment systems, and mediate the composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in activated sludge. However, whether disrupting QS could prevent soil N losses remains unclear. This study explored the feasibility of applying quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) as an innovative strategy to reduce N losses from agricultural soils. The two QSIs, penicillic acid and 4-iodo-N-[(3S)-tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl]-benzeneacetamide (4-iodo PHL), were more effective in reducing N losses than traditional inhibitors, including N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate. After 36 days of aerobic incubation, penicillic acid and 4-iodo PHL inhibited nitrification by 39\% and 68\%, respectively. The inhibitory effects are attributed to the fact that 4-iodo PHL decreased the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes, as well as the relative abundance of Candidatus Nitrocosmicus (AOA), Candidatus Nitrososphaera (AOA), and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria/comammox), while penicillic acid reduced archaeal amoA abundance and the relative abundance of Nitrosospira (AOB) and the microbes listed above. Penicillic acid also strongly inhibited denitrification (33\%) and N2O emissions (61\%) at the peak of N2O production (day 4 of anaerobic incubation) via decreasing nitrate reductase gene (narG) abundance and increasing N2O reductase gene (nosZ) abundance, respectively. Furthermore, the environmental risks of QSIs to microbial community structure and network stability, CO2 emissions, and soil animals were acceptable. Overall, QSIs have application potential in agriculture to reduce soil N losses and the associated effect on climate change. This study established a new method to mitigate N losses from the perspective of QS, and can serve as important basis of decreasing the environmental risks of agricultural nonpoint source pollution.},

The probe directly measures the complex dielectric permittivity spectrum and for this purpose requires three calibration media: air, water, and ethanol. Firstly, electromagnetic simulations were used to study the influence of the diameter of a container on the sensitivity zone of the probe with respect to the measured calibration media and isopropanol as a verification liquid. Next, the probe was tested in three soilssandy loam and two silt loamswith six water contents from air-dry to saturation. The conversion from {\textless}mml:semantics{\textgreater}S11{\textless}/mml:semantics{\textgreater} parameters to complex dielectric permittivity from vector network analyzer (VNA) measurements was obtained using an open-ended liquid procedure. The simulation and measurement results for the real part of the isopropanol dielectric permittivity obtained from four containers with different diameters were in good agreement with literature data up to 200 MHz. The real part of the dielectric permittivity was extracted and related to the moisture of the tested soil samples. Relations between the volumetric water content and the real part of the dielectric permittivity (by FDR) and apparent dielectric permittivity (by TDR) were compared with Topp's equation. It was concluded that the best fit to Topp's equation was observed in the case of a sandy loam. Data calculated according to the equation proposed by Malicki, Plagge, and Roth gave results closer to Topp's calibration. The obtained results indicated that the seven-rod probe can be used to accurately measure of the dielectric permittivity spectrum in a well-defined sample volume of about 8 cm(3) in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 200 MHz.},

	abstract = {Basal stem rot (BSR) caused by Ganoderma boninense is a major disease attacking the oil palm plantation in Malaysia, and incur big losses in palm oil industries. The disease is spread mostly by root either through spore availability in soil or roots contacts. Soil properties were reported to have significant influence on the growth of fungi. Meanwhile, the value of soil resistivity is influenced by soil properties. This paper presents a new approach of BSR detection by using soil moisture sensor which measures resistivity of soil in unit ohm (Omega) at 15 cm surrounding the basal stem of oil palm trees. The study was conducted on 39 oil palm trees at different healthiness levels. The sensor was embedded approximately 4.7 cm deep in the soil at eight different points for each palm. The results showed that healthy oil palm trees significantly have higher mean (ERMEAN {\textgreater}= 400) of electrical resistance (ER) readings compared to infected trees (ERMEAN{\textless} 400). More specifically, ER readings at points without symptoms (i.e. fruiting bodies and/or hollow) were significantly higher compared with ER readings at points where symptoms appeared even though the points of measurements were on the same palm. This finding has brought to the introduction of a new index to detect Ganoderma infection, named as K-index. Combination of ERMEAN taken from eight points of measurement and its K-index gave better results of detection and a new model was developed based on these two parameters (i.e. ERMEAN and K-index). The developed model has accuracy rates of 82\% and gained 100\% successful rate during validation. This research showed that soil resistivity can contribute to Ganoderma-infected detection in oil palms with a high degree of accuracy.},

For the above reason, a prototype device was developed including a low-cost microcontroller and suitable adaptation circuits for the aforementioned sensor. Six characteristic porous media were examined in a theta range from air drying to saturation, while four different solutions of increasing Electrical Conductivity (ECw) from 0.28 dS/m to approximately 10 dS/m were used in four of these porous media. It was found that TEROS 12 apparent dielectric permittivity (epsilon(a)) readings were lower than that of Topp's permittivity-water content relationship, especially at higher soil water content values in the coarse porous bodies. The differences are observed in sand (S), sandy loam (SL) and loam (L), at this order. The results suggested that the relationship between experimentally measured soil water content (theta(m)) and epsilon(0.5)(a) was strongly linear (0.869 {\textless} R-2 {\textless} 0.989), but the linearity of the relation theta(m)-epsilon(0.5)(a) decreases with the increase in bulk EC (sigma(b)) of the soil. The most accurate results were provided by the multipoint calibration method (CAL), as evaluated with the root mean square error (RMSE). Also, it was found that epsilon(a) degrades substantially at values of sigma(b) less than 2.5 dS/m while epsilon(a) returns to near 80 at higher values. Regarding the relation epsilon(a)-sigma(b), it seems that it is strongly linear and that its slope depends on the pore water electrical conductivity (sigma(p)) and the soil type.},

Based on that, we discuss the relationship between the structural features of Caragana korshinskii root system and the soil water content and taproot diameter. The results show that as the soil water content increased from 3.5-4.0\% to 5.5-6.0\%, the ratios of the average lengths of bone root, thick root and fine root declined from 1:0.51:0.14 to 1:0.47:0.13, and the ratios of the branch numbers of bone root, thick root and fine root increases from 1:4.43:34.94 to 1:4.60:37.13; as the taproot diameter increased from 40-50mm to 7080mm, the ratios of the average lengths of bone root, thick root and fine root declined from 1:0.44:0.13 to 1:0.41:0.11, the ratios of the branch numbers of bone root, thick root and fine root increases from 1:5:30 to 1:6:50, and both the average length of root systems of various diameter classes and branch number presented strong correlation with the soil water content.

The objective of this study was to develop an algorithm to retrieve SWC by integrating soil texture into a vegetation index derived from UAS multispectral and thermal images. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and surface temperature (T-s) derived from the UAS multispectral and thermal images were employed to construct the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) using the trapezoid model. Soil texture was incorporated into the trapezoid model based on the relationship between soil texture and the lower and upper limits of SWC to form the texture temperature vegetation dryness index (TTVDI). For validation, 128 surface soil samples, 84 in 2019 and 44 in 2020, were collected to determine soil texture and gravimetric SWC. Based on the linear regression models, the TTVDI had better performance in estimating SWC compared to the TVDI, with an increase in R-2 (coefficient of determination) by 14.5\% and 14.9\%, and a decrease in RMSE (root mean square error) by 46.1\% and 10.8\%, for the 2019 and 2020 samples, respectively.

Five sets of experiments using different soil moisture initializations were conducted from May 1 to October 1 in 2015-2017. The model forecast for each set of experiments consists of five ensemble members. The simulation using North American Regional Reanalysis is the control run (WRF-Ctrl). Four sets of sensitivity experiments were conducted with extremely wet (WRF-Wet) and dry (WRF-dry) initial conditions and using different soil moisture products from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (WRF-GLDAS) and NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive L4 (WRF-SMAP). Results show that the WRF model can capture the key features of the NAMS, but it exhibits a wet bias in the higher elevation regions and a dry bias in the lower elevation regions. Our analysis of extremely wet and dry cases reveals that initial soil moisture conditions can affect precipitation through both modulating surface energy partitioning and influencing large-scale pressure and wind patterns. When different soil moisture products are used to initialize the model, it can lead to substantial changes in spatial pattern of the NAM precipitation. Initializing the model with SMAP and GLDAS can reduce the overestimation of precipitation over high terrain areas. The results indicate that high-quality soil moisture products have the potential to improve model representation of the NAMS, especially with future improvements in model convective parameterization.},

In this study, a regional system for soil moisture prediction based on ERA5 climate reanalysis dataset, an open-source meteorological dataset issued by Copernicus Climate Change Service, was developed. It consisted of the relevant meteorological parameters for Serbia, during the period 2011-2020. Daily values of maximum and minimum air temperature, precipitation and vapour pressure deficit were used as features, and they were fed to recurrent neural network in order to predict volumetric soil moisture for three days ahead. A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network was designed and trained at a regional scale using the data from the 2011-2016 period, at 28 locations that cover four major soil types. Validation was done on 2017-2018 data and LSTM was compared with a statistical forecasting technique and a classical machine learning approach. Evaluation was done with error measures commonly used in literature. The resulting network yielded the lowest errors and proved to have good generalisation properties. The system was tested from September 2019 to April 2020 using short-range weather forecasts of Yr service.

In this study, the performance of conventional FDR MI2X and New WiTu Technology water sensors was statistically evaluated under the impact of changing vegetative cover type (corn and weeds). A three replicated randomized complete block design (RCBD) field experiment was conducted from late April to August, 2019. The spring corn Nongda- 1505 variety was planted and the field was left unsown to allow weeds to grow. To determine the SWC, six WiTu Technology sensors were installed in the middle of each plot. For FDR sensor measurements, PVC tubes were inserted at 30 cm distance from WiTu sensors and soil samples from the 0-20 cm, 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm depths were taken using soil sampling auger for measurement of gravimetric water content. Both FDR and new Technology of WiTu sensors showed varied performance as soil depth increased from the top layer to deep layer. FDR efficiency was significantly high at the topsoil layer (0-20 cm) with an average accuracy level of 98.01\% and reduced in the middle soil layer to 91.78\%, then increased to 95.13\% in the deep soil layer. While, the average accuracy of the WiTu Technology sensor ranged 98.24\%, 95.85\% and 92.02\% for top, middle and deep soil layers, respectively, these results demonstrate that the soil water detection ability of WiTu Technology is high at the soil depth of 0-40 cm, whereas FDR's ability to detect SWC changes is satisfactory in top to deep layers and low in the middle layer. Furthermore, the FDR showed good consistency with WiTu in all soil layers of the corn field, but there was a larger error for the weed field, which indicated a huge difference in the data measured by FDR and WiTu Technology. The SWC estimation of FDR and WiTu technology more fluctuated with changing vegetation cover type. Thus, the findings of this study provide an opportunity to further study on FDR MI2X and New WiTu Technology sensors for deep-rooted crops under the soil and climatic conditions of Zhengzhou, China.},

For measuring soil moisture, remote sensing methods have been relatively successful. Soil moisture is estimated from image data, using in situ moisture and an empirical scattering model via regression fit analysis. However, in situ sensor data are prone to misinterpretations, requiring verification. Herein, we aimed at investigating the application of soil moisture from the water balance model towards verification of in situ soil moisture sensor data before in situ data was assessed for its relationship with remote sensing data. In situ soil moisture sensor data was obtained at 10 and 30 cm, and CROPWAT8.0 furnished root zone soil moisture data. The correlation between the in situ soil moisture at 10 and 30 cm was 0.78; the correlation between the soil moisture from CROPWAT8.0 and the in situ soil moisture were 0.64 and 0.62 at 10 and 30 cm, respectively. The R-2 between Sentinel-1 backscatter coefficients and in situ moisture were 0.74 and 0.68 at each depth, respectively. Therefore, the water balance model could verify sensor results before assessing in situ soil moisture data for relationship with remote sensing data.},

The remote sensing soil moisture data are from the SMAP L3 soil moisture product. The results show that different weights of soil moisture in the objective function can lead to very slight differences in simulation performance of soil moisture and streamflow. Besides, the joint calibration shows no apparent advantages in terms of streamflow simulation over the traditional calibration using streamflow data only. More studies including various remote sensing soil moisture products are necessary to access their effect on the joint calibration.},

	abstract = {A good understanding of the levels and distribution patterns of soil properties and/or quality indicators is a prerequisite for developing sustainable agricultural land management programs. Traditional assessments of these parameters of soil fertility status are somewhat costly, in both economics and time aspects. Different modelling techniques have been proposed as a useful tool for determination of soil quality indicators and development of soil fertility maps, but to what extent these results are reliable remains under-quantified in many regions worldwide. To address this uncertainty, Fuzzy-Analytical Hierarchy Process (Fuzzy-AHP) and Parametric analyses were conducted to ascertain the soil fertility status of a semiarid region in the Northeast of Iran for some selected crops: alfalfa, corn silage, potato, sugar beet, tomato and wheat. The Fuzzy-AHP and Parametric techniques using soil suitability indices were estimated for each crop and each soil delineation was achieved by Ordinary Kriging. The Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) was used as a compensatory method to allow tradeoffs among the selected criteria. Our results demonstrated that from the Fuzzy-AHP analysis, the soil fertility indices ranged from moderate to high for production of alfalfa; from low to high for production of corn silage and sugar beet; moderate to high for production of potato and tomato; and from low to moderate for production of wheat. However, the parametric analysis showed soil fertility classes ranging from very low to high for production of all the selected crops. High correlations were also observed between soil fertility indices predicted by both models. Similarly, the capacities of both models to predict soil fertility status for production of the selected crops were also highly correlated. The preference for the cultivation of the selected crops based on the Fuzzy-AHP analysis was sugar beet {\textgreater} corn silage {\textgreater} wheat {\textgreater} alfalfa {\textgreater} tomato {\textgreater} potato. On the other hand, using Parametric techniques, the crops preferences for cultivation ranked as corn silage {\textgreater} wheat {\textgreater} alfalfa {\textgreater} sugar beet {\textgreater} tomato {\textgreater} potato. We concluded that the findings would help to develop sustainable plans of cultivation based on patterns related to soil fertility classes depending on each crop's requirement.},

We therefore included a semi-analytical solution of the heat transport equation into the evaluation procedure in order to consider the finite thermal properties of the heating cable without a calibration procedure to estimate effective thermal properties of the soil. To test this new evaluation procedure, we conducted a laboratory experiment and tested different heating scenarios to infer soil moisture from volumetric heat capacity. Estimates were made by analyzing the shift of the temperature amplitude at the sensing cable and the characteristics of the response heating curve. The results were compared with results from the calibrated infinite line source solution and in situ water content point measurements and showed a good approximation of thermal properties for strong and short heat pulses. Volumetric water content estimates are similarly accurate to the results of the calibrated infinite line source solution.

	abstract = {It has been widely recognised that the degree of soil wetness before precipitation events can be decisive for whether or not shallow rainfall-induced landslides occur. While there are methods to measure and/or model soil wetness in complex topography, they often exhibit limitations in spatial or temporal resolution, hindering their application in regional landside initiation modelling. In this study, we address the need for high-resolution predictions of initial saturation before rainfall events by employing data-driven linear regression models. The models were trained using in-situ soil moisture data collected from six measurement stations located in a landslide-prone region in Switzerland. Various topographic attributes, along with multiple antecedent rainfall and evapotranspiration variables were tested as input for the models. The final model consisted of five measurable variables, including cumulative antecedent rainfall, cumulative evapotranspiration, and the topographic wetness index (TWI). The model effectively reproduced the observed spatial and temporal variability of the in-situ measurements with a coefficient of determination R2 = 0.62 and a root mean square error RMSE = 0.07. Subsequently, we applied the regression model to predict the spatial soil saturation at the onset of actual landslide triggering rainfall events and integrated these patterns into the hydromechanical model STEP-TRAMM. The results demonstrate improvements in predicting observed landslide occurrences compared to simulations assuming spatially uniform initial saturation conditions, highlighting the importance of in-situ measurements and a realistic extrapolation of such data in space and time for accurate modelling of shallow landslide initiation.},

	abstract = {Drought, a destructive natural disaster, poses a significant threat to vulnerable areas worldwide. Its occurrence in Taiwan brings up concerns, particularly for vital sectors, such as the high-end semiconductor chip industry. Many satellite-based indexes have been developed to monitor the drought. The temperature-vegetation dryness index (TVDI), a commonly used drought index, uses an empirical simplification of land surface temperature (LST) and fractional vegetation cover (FVC). The newly developed temperature-soil moisture dryness index (TMDI) using the LST-normalized difference latent heat index (NDLI) space is regarded as an alternative to TVDI due to its improved ability in vegetation-sparse areas. This article presents advancements in the TMDI using the novel fractional surface water availability (FSWA) derived from the NDLI, with an emphasis on enhanced edge selection in the LST-FSWA trapezoidal space for observing drought states. An effective method has been used to select the dry and wet edges within this trapezoid. The ability of the indexes was evaluated using indicators, including the surface energy balance algorithm for land (SEBAL)-based crop water stress index (CWSI) and evapotranspiration (ET), gross primary productivity (GPP), and in situ precipitation. The results show high correlations (r) between the TVDI and both CWSI and ET, with r values of 0.85 and -0.83, respectively. The TMDI reveals even stronger relationships with CWSI (r = 0.93) and ET (r = -0.94) and is more sensitive than individual variables (FVC, FSWA, and LST) and TVDI. It also indicates a high correlation between the TVDI and GPP (r = -0.69), while the TMDI displays a higher correlation with GPP (r = -0.75). Based on the spatiotemporal analysis, the TMDI was spatially well-matched with CWSI and GPP across most of the study area. Compared to other indexes, the TMDI exhibits the highest sensitivity to precipitation (r = -0.60). By leveraging the CWSI classification, a new TMDI threshold is proposed to assess drought status in southwestern Taiwan during the fourth quarter of the years 2014-2021. Overall, the TMDI accurately captures spatiotemporal variations in drought status, providing valuable insights for irrigation managers to effectively manage limited water resources.},

An acrylic container divided into several segments was used to prepare nonuniformly wetted soils with different water contents for a series of model tests. The HETDR probe was placed horizontally at the middle height of each soil specimen, while a conventional time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe was applied vertically on the surface of the specimen. The experimental results show that as the soil water content (SWC) at a segment increases, the average amplitude decreases and the duration increases. The estimated SWC increases with the measured SWC, and especially, the difference between actual segment length and the segment length estimated from the HETDR probes is significant under dry conditions. This study demonstrates that HETDR may be a promising field-testing method for evaluating the average water content in nonuniformly wetted soils.},

In this study, the Wang Yueru (WYR) saline soil dielectric constant model, which was demonstrated to perform well in describing the effect of salinity and moisture on the dielectric constant, was validated based on experimental measurements of soil samples under different water content and salinity degrees. Furthermore, we adjusted the model form, refitted the empirical coefficient in the model, and finally acquired a two-stage model for simulating the soil dielectric constant. The enhanced model was validated under different soil moisture and salinity ranges using experimental measurements of soil samples. Compared to the original model, the proposed model exhibits a larger improvement in simulating the soil dielectric constant, and the RMSE of the simulated results dramatically decreased from 7.3 to 1.6, especially for soil with high salinity and water content. On this basis, a model suitable for L-band microwave was established. This model is of great significance for studying soil dielectric characteristics and retrieving soil parameters based on L-band data. Furthermore, this model can be used to retrieve soil salinity and water content using microwave remote sensing under a broadened application situation, such as in saline-alkali soils, wetlands, and salt marshes.},

	abstract = {In the headwater catchments of the Rocky Mountains, plant productivity and its dynamics are largely dependent upon water availability, which is influenced by changing snowmelt dynamics associated with climate change. Understanding and quantifying the interactions between snow, plants and soil moisture is challenging, since these interactions are highly heterogeneous in mountainous terrain, particularly as they are influenced by microtopography within a hillslope. Recent advances in satellite remote sensing have created an opportunity for monitoring snow and plant dynamics at high spatiotemporal resolutions that can capture microtopographic effects. In this study, we investigate the relationships among topography, snowmelt, soil moisture and plant dynamics in the East River watershed, Crested Butte, Colorado, based on a time series of 3-meter resolution PlanetScope normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) images. To make use of a large volume of high-resolution time-lapse images (17 images total), we use unsupervised machine learning methods to reduce the dimensionality of the time lapse images by identifying spatial zones that have characteristic NDVI time series. We hypothesize that each zone represents a set of similar snowmelt and plant dynamics that differ from other identified zones and that these zones are associated with key topographic features, plant species and soil moisture. We compare different distance measures (Ward and complete linkage) to understand the effects of their influence on the zonation map. Results show that the identified zones are associated with particular microtopographic features; highly productive zones are associated with low slopes and high topographic wetness index, in contrast with zones of low productivity, which are associated with high slopes and low topographic wetness index. The zones also correspond to particular plant species distributions; higher forb coverage is associated with zones characterized by higher peak productivity combined with rapid senescence in low moisture conditions, while higher sagebrush coverage is associated with low productivity and similar senescence patterns between high and low moisture conditions. In addition, soil moisture probe and sensor data confirm that each zone has a unique soil moisture distribution. This cluster-based analysis can tractably analyze high-resolution time-lapse images to examine plant-soil-snow interactions, guide sampling and sensor placements and identify areas likely vulnerable to ecological change in the future.},

	abstract = {Rapid and accurate estimation of soil moisture content (SMC) is an important part of precision agriculture, and it is also one of the key problems to be solved in field real-time monitoring and precision irrigation. Most of the existing studies are limited to SMC monitoring of bare soil, which can be obtained by optical remote sensing (e.g., multispectral, hyperspectral) or Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR). However, for the soil covered by vegetation, such as farmland, there are some theoretical defects with only one of the measuring methods. Meanwhile, in order to break through the limitations of low spatial and temporal resolutions of satellite remote sensing, it is of great significance to study SMC retrieval based on multi-source remote sensing data for the near earth UAV remote sensing systems. Based on this, this paper, taking the winter wheat planting area in Guanzhong plain of China as the research area, combines the advantages of ultra-wideband (UWB) radar, and multispectral remote sensing data, to reduce the influences of vegetation coverage on the estimation accuracy. A one-dimensional regression convolution neural network model is constructed to realize the quantitative prediction and estimation of SMC in farmland. The carried out experiments show that the proposed CNNR model has a better performance than traditional SVR and GRNN models and the R-2, RMSE and RPD are 0.7453, 0.0140 cm(3)/cm(3) and 1.9246, respectively. After introducing NDVI, MSAVI and DVI vegetation indices generated from multispectral images, the accuracy of the three models increased significantly. Among the three models, the constructed CNNR model has the best performance, and its R-2, RMSE and RPD reach 0.9168, 0.0089 cm(3)/cm(3), and 3.0201. Furthermore, after adding different levels of Gaussian noise to the original radar echoes, the CNNR model constructed in this paper still has the highest prediction accuracy and the strongest noise robustness.},

We further evaluated our product, the official soil moisture products of the five satellites, and the ensemble mean (i.e., arithmetic mean) of the five official satellite soil moisture products against ground observations from two networks in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, China. The results show that our product outperforms the individual released products of the five satellites and their ensemble means in the two validation areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) values of our product were 0.06 and 0.09 m(3)/m(3) in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively. Relative to the ensemble mean of the five satellite products, our product improves the accuracy by 9.1\% and 57.7\% in Central Tibet and Anhui Province, respectively.

The duration and severity at the arid and semiarid regions (with duration over 3 months; with an average severity of -3.1) are generally higher than those over humid regions (with the duration of 2 months; with an average severity of -2.7), but both SM datasets show higher drying trends in humid regions. However, the two SM datasets exhibit large discrepancies in the spatial patterns of drought duration, severity, and frequency trends, especially in arid and cold regions. Both SM products are capable of monitoring extreme drought events reported in southwestern, southern, and northern China compared with the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI). Overall, both data sources have the potential to be used for drought monitoring; however, caution should be paid in high altitude and latitude regions where a large discrepancy exists.},

	abstract = {New sensing technologies are at the cusp of providing state-of-the-art infrastructure to precisely monitor crop water requirements spatially so as to optimize irrigation scheduling and agricultural productivity. This project aimed to develop a new smart irrigation system that uses an L-band radiometer in conjunction with an irrigation boom, allowing for a precision water delivery system using derived high-resolution soil moisture information. A potato farm was selected due to its sensitivity to water and an existing irrigation system where the radiometer could be mounted. A field experiment was conducted to capture the soil moisture variation across the farm using the radiometer. A greenhouse trial was also conducted to mimic the actual growth of potatoes by controlling the soil moisture and exploring the impact on their growth. It was found that 0.3 cm(3)/cm(3) was the optimal moisture level in terms of productivity. Moreover, it was demonstrated that on-farm soil moisture maps could be generated with an RMSE of 0.044 cm(3)/cm(3). It is anticipated that through such technology, a real-time watering map will be generated, which will then be passed to the irrigation software to adjust the rate of each nozzle to meet the requirements without under- or over-watering.},

	abstract = {Cosmic ray neutron (CRN) sensing allows for non-invasive soil moisture measurements at the field scale and relies on the inverse correlation between aboveground measured epithermal neutron intensity (1 eV-100 keV) and environmental water content. The measurement uncertainty follows Poisson statistics and thus increases with decreasing neutron intensity, which corresponds to increasing soil moisture. In order to reduce measurement uncertainty, the neutron count rate is usually aggregated over 12 or 24 h time windows for stationary CRN probes. To obtain accurate soil moisture estimates with mobile CRN rover applications, the aggregation of neutron measurements is also necessary and should consider soil wetness and driving speed. To date, the optimization of spatial aggregation of mobile CRN observations in order to balance measurement accuracy and spatial resolution of soil moisture patterns has not been investigated in detail. In this work, we present and apply an easy-to-use method based on Gaussian error propagation theory for uncertainty quantification of soil moisture measurements obtained with CRN sensing. We used a 3(rd) order Taylor expansion for estimating the soil moisture uncertainty from uncertainty in neutron counts and compared the results to a Monte Carlo approach with excellent agreement. Furthermore, we applied our method with selected aggregation times to investigate how CRN rover survey design affects soil moisture estimation uncertainty. We anticipate that the new approach can be used to improve the strategic planning and evaluation of CRN rover surveys based on uncertainty requirements.},

We were able to produce seasonal resistivity change models that are compensated for temperature effects using a seasonal temperature profile model. Time-lapse sections of percentage resistivity changes show spatial and temporal overall consistency with seasonal variations of soil temperature. Discrepancies are likely due to the pavement layer that is not well considered in the inversion process as well as to time-lapse inversion pitfalls. Furthermore, a detailed estimation of seasonal moisture content variations could not be given as an accurate calibration of the employed suction probes was not achievable. Nevertheless, the levee appears to have spatially consistent time variations in soil moisture, clearly influenced by both rainfall and water table and river levels. Future work on developing 3D acquisitions and adding embedded moisture content probes should prove effective to our monitoring design and give a more detailed understanding of the soil moisture seasonal behaviour in the studied stretch of levee.

Monthly SMC data from the Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity (SMOS) with a spatial resolution of 25 km were used to assess the SMC change from January 2010 to December 2021. Various trend patterns, including linear, quadratic, cubic, and concealed, were examined by applying a parametric polynomial fitting-based algorithm (Polytrend). In particular, approximately 16.93\% of global land is subjected to soil moisture dynamics, of which 8.33\% has become drier and 8.60\% has become wetter. Both linear and nonlinear trends were observed in the global land areas that have experienced statistically significant changes. The concealed and linear trends were however the dominant trend patterns globally. The obtained trend results were further investigated using a well-known non-parametric trend test, Mann-Kendall, which showed 93.20\% agreement, demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the observed trends.},

The weekly standard SM index (SSI) calculated from the ESA CCI SM dataset is utilized to monitor the agricultural drought over the Yellow River Basin (YRB) during 2000-2012.

The results show that the interpolated ESA CCI SM is significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) correlated with the observed SM, and more than 84\% of the grids in the YRB display strong correlations with the global reanalysis SM. ESA CCI SSI presents a similar spatiotemporal pattern as VIC-scPDSI, while exhibiting a significantly delayed response to SPI and SPEI. The average residence time of drought reflected by ESA CCI SSI from short periods of extreme drought and long periods of less extreme drought are above 1 week and 3 weeks later than that represented by SPI and SPEI.

In order to overcome the constraints of the Perpendicular Drought Index, PDI (performs poorly over the fields with dense vegetation and hard to construct the soil line), and the Temperature Vegetation Drought Index, TVDI (requires similar atmospheric forcing and large enough dimension of mapping area), in soil moisture monitoring, a new drought index (Normalized Temperature Drought Index, NTDI) is proposed to explore the spatiotemporal changes of soil moisture by substituting red and near-infrared reflectances with vegetation index and normalized land surface temperature on the basis of the PDI framework. Victoria, Australia, was selected as the study area as it experiences many severe droughts and has been affected for more than ten years. Time series of satellite-based data were applied to evaluate the effectiveness and applicability of the NTDI at the regional scale. Results indicated that the expression of the soil line representing the water condition of the bare soil is easier to obtain in the new trapezoid framework and has good fits with the coefficients of determination (R-2) of more than 0.8. Compared with PDI, TVDI and Modified PDI (MPDI) at the cropping sites, NTDI exhibits a relatively better performance in soil moisture monitoring for most days where the R-2 achieved can reach to more than 0.7 on DOY 242, 254 and 272. Meanwhile, spatial-temporal mappings of the four drought indices from satellite data were conducted, and the NTDI presented the slightly seasonal variation and effectively described the real spatial characteristics of regional drought. Overall, the NTDI seems to a viable approach and can provide insight into spatial and temporal soil moisture monitoring at different scales.},

This need becomes even more critical in arid and semi-arid regions, where there are a lack of in situ observations. In this regard, satellite-based Soil Moisture (SM) data is promising due to the temporal resolution of acquisitions and the spatial coverage of observations. Satellite-based SM products are only able to estimate moisture from the soil top layer; however, linking SSM with RZSM would provide valuable information on land surface-atmosphere interactions. In the present study, satellite-based SSM data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) are first compared with the few available SM in situ observations, and are then coupled with the Soil Moisture Analytical Relationship (SMAR) model to estimate RZSM in Iran. The comparison between in situ SM observations and satellite data showed that the SMAP satellite products provide more accurate description of SSM with an average correlation coefficient (R) of 0.55, root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.078 m(3) m(-3) and a Bias of 0.033 m(3)( )m(-3). Thereafter, the SMAP satellite products were coupled with SMAR model, providing a description of the RZSM with performances that are strongly influenced by the misalignment between point and pixel processes measured in the preliminary comparison of SSM data.},

Most of the optical sensors mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles and satellites provide the RGB and NIR bands, but only a few offer SWIR output. The Red-NIR reflectance space has been widely applied for remote sensing of various land surface variables including soil moisture. The linear relationship between the Red-NIR reflectance of bare soil is established as the base and then moisture isolines are assumed perpendicular to the soil line. In this study, we show that this assumption is not consistent with the actual Red-NIR space geometry, which in many cases introduces soil moisture estimation errors. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new mathematical transformation to the original Red-NIR space followed by newly defined soil moisture isolines that are more consistent with the actual observations. This new Transformed Red-NIR (TRN) model is compared with the Conventional Red-NIR (CRN) model using data from a sugarcane field located in southwestern Iran. Twelve Land Remote-Sensing Satellite (Landsat)-8 images were acquired during the sugarcane growth season. For validation of the remotely sensed data, ground reference soil moisture was determined at 22 locations at five different depths via core sampling and oven-drying. Our results indicate that the TRN model significantly improves the accuracy of remotely sensed soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Despite irrigation being one of the main sources of anthropogenic water consumption, detailed information about water amounts destined for this purpose are often lacking worldwide. In this study, a methodology which can be used to estimate irrigation amounts over a pilot area in Spain by exploiting remotely sensed soil moisture is proposed. Two high-resolution DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled soil moisture products have been used: SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) at 1 km. The irrigation estimates have been obtained through the SM2RAIN algorithm, in which the evapotranspiration term has been improved to adequately reproduce the crop evapotranspiration over irrigated areas according to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) model. The experiment exploiting the SMAP data at 1 km represents the main work analyzed in this study and covered the period from January 2016 to September 2017. The experiment with the SMOS data at 1 km, for which a longer time series is available, allowed the irrigation estimates to be extended back to 2011. For both of the experiments carried out, the proposed method performed well in reproducing the magnitudes of the irrigation amounts that actually occurred in four of the five pilot irrigation districts. The SMAP experiment, for which a more detailed analysis was performed, also provided satisfactory results in representing the spatial distribution and the timing of the irrigation events. In addition, the investigation into which term of the SM2RAIN algorithm plays the leading role in determining the amount of water entering into the soil highlights the importance of correct representation of the evapotranspiration process.},

Limited hydroclimate and yield data, however, hamper drought impact monitoring and assessment at the farm field scale. This study demonstrates the potential of using field-scale soil moisture simulations to support high-resolution agricultural yield prediction and drought monitoring at the smallholder farm field scale. We present a multiscale modeling approach that combines HydroBlocks - a physically based hyper-resolution land surface model (LSM) - with machine learning. We used HydroBlocks to simulate root zone soil moisture and soil temperature in Zambia at 3 h 30 m resolution. These simulations, along with remotely sensed vegetation indices, meteorological data, and descriptors of the physical landscape (related to topography, land cover, and soils) were combined with district-level maize data to train a random forest (RF) model to predict maize yields at district and field scales (250 m). Our model predicted yields with an average testing coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.57 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 310 kg ha(-1) using year-based cross-validation. Our predicted maize losses due to the 2015-2016 El Nino drought agreed well with losses reported by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Our results reveal that soil moisture is the strongest and most reliable predictor of maize yield, driving its spatial and temporal variability. Soil moisture was also a more effective indicator of drought impacts on crops than precipitation, soil and air temperatures, and remotely sensed normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based drought indices. This study demonstrates how field-scale modeling can help bridge the spatial-scale gap between drought monitoring and agricultural impacts.},

On the one hand, a sparse sample exploitation (SSE) method was developed to solve the problem of sample scarcity, resultant from cloud obstruction in optical images and the malfunction of in situ SMC-measuring instruments. With this method, data typically excluded in conventional approaches can be adequately employed. On the other hand, apart from the basic input parameters commonly discussed in previous studies, a couple of new parameters were optimized to improve the feature description.

In this context, validation of the global data set is of substance. Remote sensing measurements which are representative of an area covering 100 m2 to tens of km2 rarely match with in situ SM measurements at point scale due to scale difference. In this paper we present the new Indian Cosmic Ray Network (ICON) and compare it's data with remotely sensed SM at different depths. ICON is the first network in India of the kind. It is operational since 2016 and consist of seven sites equipped with the COSMOS instrument. This instrument is based on the Cosmic Ray Neutron Probe (CRNP) technique which uses non-invasive neutron counts as a measure of soil moisture. It provides in situ measurements over an area with a radius of 150-250 m. This intermediate scale soil moisture is of interest for the validation of satellite SM. We compare the COSMOS derived soil moisture to surface soil moisture (SSM) and root zone soil moisture (RZSM) derived from SMOS, SMAP and GLDAS\_Noah. The comparison with surface soil moisture products yield that the SMAP\_L4\_SSM showed best performance over all the sites with correlation (R) values ranging from 0.76 to 0.90. RZSM on the other hand from all products showed lesser performances. RZSM for GLDAS and SMAP\_L4 products show that the results are better for the top layer R = 0.75 to 0.89 and 0.75 to 0.90 respectively than the deeper layers R = 0.26 to 0.92 and 0.6 to 0.8 respectively in all sites in India.

Shahaoqu Experimental Station within Jiefangzha Irrigation District of Hetao Irrigation Area is selected as the study area. The dataset includes GF-1 satellite remote sensing images and measured soil moisture content. The study employs the best subset selection to determine the combination of sensitive variables for soil moisture content at different soil depths. Additionally, robust regression theory is introduced to traditional linear regression and machine learning algorithms to construct soil moisture content inversion models at different soil depths. The results show that all three improved robust algorithms effectively reduce the influence of outliers, improve the accuracy and stability of these inversion models. The improved robust nonlinear algorithm outperforms the improved robust linear algorithm. Compared with the unprocessed algorithm, at the soil depth of 0-20 cm, Robust Extreme Learning Machine (RELM) algorithm is the most optimal, with the validation set's R-adj(2) increasing from 0.555 to 0.696 (approximately 25.33\%) and the RMSE decreasing from 0.025 to 0.018 (approximately 26.54\%).

The improved robust regression algorithms can improve the accuracy and applicability of soil moisture content estimation and provide a reference for monitoring soil moisture content using GF-1 satellite.},

	abstract = {Remote-sensing methods based on optical and thermal satellite imagery have been proposed to estimate fine-resolution (30 m) rootzone soil moisture (theta) over bar. In these methods (theta) over bar. is most commonly estimated using a single empirical relationship with evaporative fraction Lambda(SEB) or evaporative index Lambda(PET). Methods have been proposed recently to estimate these relationships based on regional climate, soil, and vegetation characteristics, but those methods have not yet been applied to estimate (theta) over bar from remote sensing data. The objective of this study is to evaluate the. estimates from remote sensing when the Lambda(SEB) vs. (theta) over bar and Lambda(PET) vs. (theta) over bar relationships are inferred from regional characteristics using the previously proposed methods. Four study regions are considered including the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed in Arizona, the Pinon Canyon Maneuver Site and Lower Arkansas River Valley in Colorado, the Little Washita and Fort Cobb Experimental Watersheds in Oklahoma, and the Mississippi Delta region in Mississippi. The (theta) over bar estimates from the regionally adapted relationships are compared to (theta) over bar estimates from the single empirical relationship and to in situ (theta) over bar measurements. The estimates from the regionally adapted relationships consistently outperform the estimates form the single empirical relationship. The performance typically improves as more regional information is used in the relationships and reduces the root mean squared error of (theta) over bar by an average of 45\% among the four regions. The regional method typically performs better for the arid and semiarid regions with root mean squared errors of 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.04 cm(3) cm(-3), respectively. The regionally adapted relationships better capture both spatial and temporal variations of soil moisture than the single empirical relationship.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key modifier of runoff generation from rainfall excess, including during extreme precipitation events associated with Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This paper presents a new, publicly available dataset from a soil moisture monitoring network in Northern California's Russian River Basin, designed to assess soil moisture controls on runoff generation under AR conditions. The observations consist of 2-min volumetric soil moisture at 19 sites and 6 depths (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 cm), starting in summer 2017. The goals of this monitoring network are to aid the development of research applications and situational awareness tools for Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations at Lake Mendocino. We present short analyses of these data to demonstrate their capability to characterize soil moisture responses to precipitation across sites and depths, including time series analysis, correlation analysis, and identification of soil saturation thresholds that induce runoff. Our results show strong inter-site Pearson's correlations ({\textgreater}0.8) at the seasonal timescale. Correlations are strong ({\textgreater}0.8) during events with high antecedent soil moisture and during drydown periods, and weak ({\textless}0.5) otherwise. High event runoff ratios are observed when antecedent soil moisture thresholds are exceeded, and when antecedent runoff is high. Although local heterogeneity in soil moisture can limit the utility of point source data in some hydrologic model applications, our analyses indicate three ways in which soil moisture data are valuable for model design: (1) sensors installed at 6 depths per location enable us to identify the soil depth below which evapotranspiration and saturation dynamics change, and therefore choose model soil layer depths, (2) time series analysis indicates the role of soil moisture processes in controlling runoff ratio during precipitation, which hydrologic models should replicate, and (3) spatial correlation analysis of the soil moisture fluctuations helps identify when and where distributed hydrologic modelling may be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.) is an important oil crop worldwide, and the Yangtze River Basin (YRB) region is one of the most vital rapeseeds producing areas in China. However, the uneven distribution of annual precipitation during the rapeseed seedling stage in this region often leads to droughts and waterlogging, resulting in declined rapeseed seedling quality and yield. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the impact of micro-ridge-furrow planting (MR) and conventional flat cropping planting (FC) under straw returning on rapeseed seedling growth and yield during two growing seasons: wet year (WY) and dry year (DY). In MR planting, rapeseed was sown either on the ridge surface (RS) or in the ridge furrow (RF). We found that MR planting had stronger regulation of soil temperature and humidity compared to FC. The average soil volume water content in RS was 19.2 \% lower than FC, while in RF, it was 9.0 \% higher than FC. Under MR planting, the daily temperature fluctuations in RF were smaller than in FC, whereas in RS, they were larger than in FC. Through the adjustment of temperature and humidity, MR increased the activities of beta-glucosidase (beta-Glu) and cellulose disaccharide hydrolase (CBH) in the soil, thereby accelerating rice straw decomposition. Importantly, MR led to improved root growth, seedling quality, precipitation water use efficiency (WUEP), and yield of rapeseed during both the WY and DY seasons. Notably, root morphological traits were significantly altered under straw returning (RT) in MR, particularly with an 11.0 \% increase in root surface area, which showed a significant correlation with the indoleacetic acid and jasmonic acid contents in the root system. Furthermore, RT increased antioxidant enzymes activity in rapeseed roots. The H2O2 and center dot OH contents in MR were lower than in FC, indicating that the roots of MR were capable of self-protection and reducing the accumulation of superoxide radicals and peroxides by adapting actively to the soil water environment under straw returning. The yield and WUEP of MR were higher by 11.9 \% and 21.0 \%, respectively, compared to FC. In conclusion, MR planting has the potential to enhance seedling quality and increase rapeseed yield when combined with rice straw returning. This finding provides technical support for realizing the full and strong seedling establishment and improving the cultivation of directseeded rapeseed in the YRB region.},

Therefore, in strawberry cultivation, reasonable water and soil moisture management is very important, growers need to carry out timely irrigation and drainage according to the growth of strawberry, to ensure the growth and yield of strawberry. Its disadvantages include the following: vulnerable to diseases and pests, high requirements for climatic conditions, high requirements for climatic conditions and high production costs.

C-band SAR can resolve features at field scale, or better, but responds to moisture only within the top 1 to 2 cm of the soil. When validating SAR-derived soil moisture products against standard in situ measurements at 5 to 10 cm depth, the greater moisture variability at the soil surface may be inaccurately categorized as measurement error. An alternative method was developed where the C-band SAR product is validated against soil moisture simulated at 2 cm depth by the HYDRUS-1D model. This reproduces soil moisture depth profiles from daily meteorological observations, leaf area index, and soil hydraulic parameters. The model was fitted at 13 COSMOS-UK sites so that the model output at 10 cm depth closely reproduced the cosmic ray neutron sensor data. At ten of the sites studied, there was an improvement of up to 8\% in root-mean-squared difference by validating the Copernicus surface soil moisture (SSM) product at 2 cm compared to 10 cm. This suggests that Copernicus SSM and other C-band SAR surface soil moisture algorithms may be more accurate than have hitherto been acknowledged.},

This study investigated the characteristics of a grassland vegetation community at different grazing gradients and growing seasons and its impact on SM inversion using remote sensing data. The water cloud model (WCM) was used for SM inversion, and both field and remote sensing data collected from 2019 to 2021 were used for calibration and prediction. The study found that the calibrated WCM achieved prediction results of SM inversion with average R-2 values of 0.41 and 0.38 at different grazing gradients and growing seasons, respectively. Vegetation biomass and height were significantly correlated with vegetation indexes, and the highest model prediction accuracy was achieved for biomass and height around 121.1 g/m(2) [102.3-139.9] and 18.6 cm [17.3-19.8], respectively. Generally, NDWI1 produced higher SM estimation accuracy than NDWI2. The growing season of vegetation also affects the accuracy of the WCM to retrieve SM, with the highest accuracy achieved in mid-growing season I. Therefore, the developed WCM with optimal height and biomass of vegetation communities can enhance the SM prediction capacity; it thus can be potentially used for SM prediction in typical grasslands.},

It is a highly required parameter that may vary significantly both spatially and temporally. Due to this fact, its estimation is challenging and often hard to obtain especially over large, heterogeneous surfaces. This study aimed at comparing the performance of four widely used interpolation methods in estimating soil moisture using GPS-aided information and remote sensing. The Distance Weighting (IDW), Spline, Ordinary Kriging models and Kriging with External Drift (KED) interpolation techniques were employed to estimate soil moisture using 82 soil moisture field-measured values. Of those measurements, data from 54 soil moisture locations were used for calibration and the remaining data for validation purposes. The study area selected was Varanasi City, India covering an area of 1535 km(2). The soil moisture distribution results demonstrate the lowest RMSE (root mean square error, 8.69\%) for KED, in comparison to the other approaches. For KED, the soil organic carbon information was incorporated as a secondary variable. The study results contribute towards efforts to overcome the issue of scarcity of soil moisture information at local and regional scales. It also provides an understandable method to generate and produce reliable spatial continuous datasets of this parameter, demonstrating the added value of geospatial analysis techniques for this purpose.},

However, the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed SM is insufficient for some hydrological applications. In this paper, a data-driven model is proposed based on a hybrid approach called artificial neural network kriging (ANNK) to capture the interaction between SM and ancillary data (AD), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), altitude, slope, Antecedent Moisture Condition, AMC (5-day cumulative precipitation), and daily air temperature (DAT)/land surface temperature (LST). By co-regionalization of the estimated SM from the ANNK and SMAP 36-km product, SM in any part of the study area is estimated more accurately and on a finer resolution (1-km). Finally, through a linear relationship between in-situ SM with the up-to-date AD including AMC (previous 5-day cumulative precipitation), LST or DAT, slope, NDVI, and the downscaled satellite SM, the soil moisture estimates are adjusted by also adding an error term. Estimation of the final SM product in terms of the Unbiased Root Mean Square Error of less than 0.04 m(3)/m(3) meets the accuracy requirements of the SMAP SM retrieval. Moreover, the results of SM validation show that the proposed technique has a potential for real-time SM estimations in developing areas.},

In this study, six soil nutrient indicators, including soil organic matter (SOM), total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorus (AP), and available potassium (AK) were measured in five different aged stands of Chinese fir forests in subtropical China. A structural equation model (SEM) was developed based on these soil nutrients indicators in order to better evaluate the soil fertility index (SFI) in these studied forests. The results show that soil nutrient contents changed with the soil depth in different age groups. The SOM decreased in a specific order: over mature {\textgreater} mature {\textgreater} near mature {\textgreater} middle {\textgreater} young stands. The TN content of the soil gradually decreased with increased soil depth throughout all age groups. The SEM indicated that the TN had the highest weight of 0.4154, while the TP had the lowest weight at 0.1991 for estimating the SFI. The weights of other indicators (AN, SOM, AP, and AK) ranged 0.2138-0.3855 in our study. The established SEM satisfied the fitness reference values and was able to accurately describe the forest soil nutrient status through the SFI. The overall SFI values were significantly higher in over mature stands than in young-aged stands and in topsoil than in deeper soil in all examined forests. Soil TN, AP, and AK were the most important nutrient indicators to the evaluation of the SFI in the study sites. The results confirmed that the SEM was suitable to estimate the weights of the SFI and better describe the soil nutrient status in forests.

L-band passivemicrowave satellite remote sensing is themost feasible option to estimate near-surface soil moisture (similar to 0-5 cmsoil depth) over large extents, but its coarse resolution (similar to 10s of km) means that it is unable to capture the variability of soil moisture in detail. Therefore, different downscaling methods have been tested as a solution tomeet the demand for high spatial resolution soil moisture. Downscaling algorithms based on the soil thermal inertia relationship between diurnal soil temperature difference (Delta T) and dailymean soil moisture content (mu(SM)) have shown promising results over arid and semi-arid landscapes. However, the linearity of these algorithms is affected by factors such as vegetation, soil texture and meteorology in a complex manner. This study tested a (i) Regression Tree (RT), an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and a Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) model based on the soil thermal inertia theory over a semi-arid agricultural landscape in Australia, given the ability of machine learning algorithms to capture complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and responses. Downscaled soil moisture from the RT, ANN and GPR models showed root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.03, 0.09 and 0.07 cm(3)/cm(3) compared to airborne retrievals and unbiased RMSEs (ubRMSEs) of 0.07, 0.08 and 0.05 cm(3)/cm(3) compared to in-situ observations, respectively.

Obtaining accurate information on SMC in real time over large agricultural areas has important guiding significance for crop yield estimation and production management. In this study, the paper reports on the retrieval of SMC from RADARSAT-2 polarimetric SAR data. The proposed SMC retrieval algorithm includes vegetation correction based on a ratio method and roughness correction based on the optimal roughness method. Three vegetation description parameters (i.e., RVI, LAI, and NDVI) serve as vegetation descriptors in the parameterization of the algorithm. To testify the vegetation correction result of the algorithm, the water cloud model (WCM) was compared with the algorithm. The calibrated integrated equation model (CIEM) was employed to describe the backscattering from the underlying soil. To improve the accuracy of SMC retrieval, the CIEM model was optimized by using the optimal roughness parameter and the normalization method of reference incidence angle. Validation against ground measurements showed a high correlation between the measured and estimated SMC when the NDVI serves as vegetation descriptor (R-2 = 0.68, RMSE = 4.15 vol.\%, p {\textless} 0.01). The overall estimation performance of the proposed SMC retrieval algorithm is better than that of the WCM. It demonstrates that the proposed algorithm has an operational potential to estimate SMC over wheat fields during the growing season.},

In Australia and several south-west Pacific Small Island Developing States (SIDS), there are a limited number of in situ SM stations that can adequately assess soil-water availability in a near-real-time context. Satellite SM datasets provide a viable alternative for SM monitoring and agrometeorological drought provision in these regions.

Products were first evaluated in Australia, given the presence of several in-situ SM monitoring stations and a state-of-the-art hydrological model-the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape modelling system (AWRA-L). We further investigated the accuracy of SM satellite datasets in Australia and the south-west Pacific through Triple Collocation analysis with two other SM reference datasets-ERA5 reanalysis SM data and model data from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset. All datasets have differing observation periods ranging from 1911-now, with a common period of observations between 2015-2021. Results demonstrated that ASCAT and SMOS were consistently superior in their performance. Analysis in the six south-west Pacific SIDS indicated reduced performance for all products, with ASCAT and SMOS still performing better than others for most SIDS with median R values ranging between 0.3-0.9. We conducted a case study of the 2015 El Nino and Positive Indian Ocean Dipole-induced drought in Papua New Guinea. It was shown that ASCAT is a valuable dataset indicative of agrometeorological drought for the nation, highlighting the value of using satellite SM products to provide early warning of drought in data-sparse regions in the south-west Pacific.},

The Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensor (CRNS) is a novel and innovative approach to estimate area-averaged soil water content at an intermediate scale, which has been implemented across the globe. The CRNS is moderated by all hydrogen sources within its measurement footprint. In order to isolate the soil water content signal from the neutron intensity, the other sources of hydrogen need to be accounted for. The CRNS's applications are not only limited to soil water content estimation, as it can potentially be used to monitor biomass. The Two-Streams clear-felling provided the unique opportunity to monitor the cosmic ray neutron intensities before, during, and after the clear-felling. The cadmium-difference method was used to obtain the pure thermal and epithermal neutron intensities from the bare and moderated detectors. The study concluded that the presence of biomass within the site reduced the epithermal neutron intensity by 12.43\% and theN(0)value by 13.8\%. The use of the neutron ratio to monitor biomass was evaluated and changes in the neutron ratio coincided with biomass changes and resulted in a high correlation (R(2)of 0.868) with the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and (R(2)of 0.817) leaf area index (LAI). The use of the CRNS to simultaneously monitor soil water content and biomass will be beneficial in providing more reliable soil water content estimates, provide biomass estimates at a field scale, and aid in understanding the dynamics between soil water content and vegetation.},

	abstract = {Mapping the soil moisture is a key activity in water management and sustainable agriculture, especially in regions characterised by fragile agri-food systems and water scarcity. Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensors (CRNS) is a contactless nuclear technology used for estimating soil moisture (SM) content on a 20-30 m scale at the landscape level. Very interestingly, this corresponds to the so-called intermediate scale gap between the local probes, operating on the meter scale, and the satellite-based technologies, working on the kilometre scale and above. In state-of-art CRNS, the cosmic neutrons degraded by the soil are simply counted by a slightly moderated thermal neutron counter. After a calibration procedure, the SM is inferred by combining this count rate with environmental parameters: the atmospheric pressure, temperature and the air humidity. As the SM affects not only the environmental neutron fluence rate but also its energy distribution, this study was organised in such a way to understand if a CRNS with spectrometric capabilities could provide improved information on the SM distribution. To this aim, an environmental neutron spectrometer was designed by extending the Bonner Spheres to a more sensitive system made of moderating cylinders embedding long BF3{\textbackslash}textbackslashdocumentclass[12pt]\{minimal\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{amsmath\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{wasysym\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{amsfonts\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{amssymb\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{amsbsy\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{mathrsfs\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashusepackage\{upgreek\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashsetlength\{{\textbackslash}textbackslashoddsidemargin\}\{-69pt\} {\textbackslash}textbackslashbegin\{document\}{\textbackslash} \_3 {\textbackslash}textbackslashend\{document\} proportional counters, the Moderating Cylinders Spectrometer (MCS).

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an essential component for the planetary balance between land surface water and energy. Obtaining long-term global soil moisture data is important for understanding the water cycle changes in the warming climate. To date several satellite soil moisture products are being developed with varying retrieval algorithms, however with considerable missing values. To resolve the data gaps, here we have constructed two global satellite soil moisture products, i.e., the CCI (Climate Change Initiative soil moisture, 1989-2021; CCIori hereafter) and the CM (Correlation Merging soil moisture, 2006-2019; CMori hereafter) products separately using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with autoencoding approach, which considers soil moisture variability in both time and space. The reconstructed datasets, namely CCIrec and CMrec, are cross-evaluated with artificial missing values, and further againt in-situ observations from 12 networks including 485 stations globally, with multiple error metrics of correlation coefficients (R), bias, root mean square errors (RMSE) and unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) respectively. The cross-validation results show that the reconstructed missing values have high R (0.987 and 0.974, respectively) and low RMSE (0.015 and 0.032 m(3)/m(3), respectively) with the original ones. The in-situ validation shows that the global mean R between CCIrec (CCIori) and in-situ observations is 0.590 (0.581), RMSE is 0.093 (0.093) m(3)/m(3), ubRMSE is 0.059 (0.058) m(3)/m(3), bias is 0.032 (0.037) m(3)/m(3) respectively; CMrec (CMori) shows quite similar results. The added value of this study is to provide long-term gap-free satellite soil moisture products globally, which helps studies in the fields of hydrology, meteorology, ecology and climate sciences.},

The accuracy of the matric potential determinations was approximately 10\% in log scale. The effective range for w measurements was -1000 to -2.5 m of water, and the accuracy of the w determinations was best between -350 and -2.5 m of water, which included values of field capacity and wilting point for most soils and crops. The sensor design included a single heater wire to provide simultaneous heat inputs to two different materials, i.e., the soil and the sensor porous medium. The single heater wire did not influence sensor accuracy as long as the soil and the sensor porous medium thermal conductivity values were not significantly different. The new DPHP based sensor effectively measured various soil properties, including soil water matric potential, soil water content, and soil thermal property values.},

The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) constellation is a satellite system that uses GNSS-R technology with high temporal resolution and has been a popular data source in soil moisture retrieval in recent years. However, the constant movement of GNSS transmitters and GNSS-R satellites results in potentially chaotic and random observations of the Earth's surface, with many unevenly distributed gaps in the observed data. In this paper, a gap-filling method based on spatial autocorrelation is proposed to interpolate the gaps within these observation datasets, with SM being estimated post-interpolation. The sample set for the model comprises points surrounding the interpolation target, with modeling conducted considering factors of spatial weighting to estimate values at the interpolation target. Different autocorrelation-based gap-filling methods using CYGNSS data can achieve good estimation accuracy, and the data coverage after interpolation is on average 1.8 times greater than before interpolation. The gap-filling method using XGBoost achieves the best performance and offers the highest accuracy in SM estimation, with an average correlation coefficient of 0.8445, and an average RMSE of 0.0457 m(3)/m(3). The gap-filling approach can significantly enhance data coverage and facilitate the filling of daily gaps in CYGNSS data with all maintaining high SM estimation accuracy. The estimation of daily missing values using CYGNSS data can fully exploit the embedded surface features in the data's fine resolution and can provide high-resolution SM retrieval.},

The constructed NNE model predicts daily root zone soil moisture continuously for the whole crop growing season and the water consumption and supply processes were separately modeled. The soil profile was divided into multiple layers and modeled separately. Weather data (including air temperature, humidity, wind speed, net radiation, and precipitation), rooting depth, and the hesternal soil moisture of each layer were used as the input. A calibrated root zone water quality model for maize (Zea mays L.) was used to generate training and evaluation data. The result showed that with 100 randomly initialized NN models, the NNE model achieved an average R-2 of 0.96 and nRMSE of 5.93\%, suggesting that the NNE model learned the soil moisture dynamics well and sufficiently improved the robustness of soil moisture prediction with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {The surface soil moisture (SSM) products derived from microwave remote sensing have a coarse spatial resolution; therefore, downscaling is required to obtain accurate SSM at high spatial resolution. An effective way to handle the stratified heterogeneity is to model for various stratifications; however, the number of samples is often limited under each stratification, influencing the downscaling accuracy. In this study, a machine learning-based geostatistical model, which combines various kinds of ancillary information at fine spatial scale, is developed for spatial downscaling. The proposed support vector area-to-area regression kriging (SVATARK) model incorporates support vector regression and area-to-area kriging by considering the nonlinear relationships among variables for various stratifications. SVATARK also considers the change of support problem in the downscaling interpolation process as well as for solving the small sample size in trend prediction. The SVATARK method is evaluated in the Naqu region on the Tibetan Plateau, China, to downscale the European Space Agency's (ESA) 25-km-resolution SSM product. The 1-km-resolution SSM predictions have been produced every eight days over a six-year period (2010-2015). Compared with five other downscaling methods, the downscaled predictions from the SVATARK method performs the best with in situ observations, resulting in a 24.4\% reduction in root-mean-square error with 0.08 m(3)center dot m(-3) and a 8.2\% increase in correlation coefficient with 0.72, on average. Additionally, anomalously low SSM values, an indicator of drought, had a record low anomaly in mid-July for 2015, as noted by previous studies, indicating that SVATARK could be utilized for drought monitoring.},

This work aimed at assessing the performance of a portable XRF (XRF) sensor set up with two different X-ray tube configurations (combinations of voltage and current) to predict nine key soil fertility attributes: (clay, organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH, base saturation (V), and extractable nutrients (P, K, Ca, and Mg). An XRF, operated at a voltage of 15 kV (and current of 23 mu A) and 35 kV (and current of 7 mu A), was used for analyzing 102 soil samples collected from two agricultural fields in Brazil. Two different XRF data analysis scenarios were used to build the predictive models: (i) 10 emission lines of 15 keV spectra (EL-15), and (ii) 12 emission lines of 35 keV spectra (EL-35). Multiple linear regressions (MLR) were used for model calibration, and the models' prediction performance was evaluated using different figures of merit. The results show that although X-ray tube configuration affected the intensity of the emission lines of the different elements detected, it did not influence the prediction accuracy of the studied key fertility attributes, suggesting that both X-ray tube configurations tested can be used for future analyses. Satisfactory predictions with residual prediction deviation (RPD) {\textgreater}= 1.54 and coefficient of determination (R-2) {\textgreater}= 0.61 were obtained for eight out of the ten studied soil fertility attributes (clay, OM, CEC, V, and extractable K, Ca, and Mg). In addition, simple MLR models with a limited number of emission lines was effective for practical soil analysis of the key soil fertility attributes (except pH and extractable P) using XRF. The simple and transparent methodology suggested also enables future researches that seek to optimize the XRF scanning time in order to speed up the XRF analysis in soil samples.},

	abstract = {While laboratory methods of elemental analysis of soil nutrients are used frequently to support soil studies, the implementation of more portable and cost-efficient methods lingers behind. The portable (handheld) X-ray fluorescence spectrometer (XRF) is one such tool enabling onsite elemental analysis in a straightforward manner. However, in soil studies the use of XRF often remains cumbersome, following the poor performance of the method for low-Z elemental analysis and the complex nature of the soil matrix, introducing background noise. Here, we therefore evaluate how the potential use of a portable XRF for predicting potassium (K), phosphorus (P), magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) can be improved through the analysis of XRF spectral data with the Random Forest (RF) machine learning method. A total of 105 soil samples from a wide range of soils collected from 10 different countries (D.R. Congo, Belgium, Ivory Coast, Italy, The Netherlands, Saudi-Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, and Zimbabwe) were scanned using an Oxford XMET8000 XRF spectrometer (Oxford Instruments, UK). Spectral data of the calibration set (n = 74) were pulled in one matrix alongside measured elemental concentrations and subjected to RF analysis. Resulting models were validated using an independent validation set (n = 31). The best RF prediction result was obtained for K followed successively by Ca, Mg and P with coefficient of determination (R-2) values of 0.83, 0.76, 0.69, and 0.47, and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) of 2283.8, 6818.7, 1511.8, and 538.08 mg kg(-1), respectively. The RF modelling procedure provided improved prediction performance compared to the calibration models provided by the manufacturer (R-2 = 0.65, 0.75, 0.65, and 0.22, for K, Ca, Mg and P, respectively). Our results suggest that portable XRF instruments coupled with spectral data analysis by RF allows for rapid and low-cost analysis of soil K and Ca with remarkable accuracy. Still, the lower measurement accuracy for P and Mg suggests further work is needed to test whether the prediction can be improved by better calibration models, and how such approaches can help overcoming instrumental limitations.},

Earth System Models (ESMs) are the key tools for predicting the response of SM to future climate change. Many ESMs provide outputs for SM; however, the estimated SM accuracy from different ESMs varies geographically as each ESM has its advantages and limitations. This study aimed to develop a merged SM product with improved accuracy and spatial resolution in China for 2015-2100 through data fusion of 25 ESMs with a deep-learning (DL) method. A DL model that can simultaneously perform data fusion and spatial downscaling was used to analyze SM's future trend in China. Through the model, monthly SM data in four future scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, SSP5-8.5) from 2015 to 2100, with a high resolution at 0.25 degrees, was obtained. The evaluation metrics include mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square difference (RMSD), unbiased root mean square difference (ubRMSD), and coefficient of correlation (r). The evaluation results showed that our merged SM product is significantly better than each of the ESMs and the ensemble mean of all ESMs in terms of accuracy and spatial distribution. In the temporal dimension, the merged product is equivalent to the original data after deviation correction and equivalent to reconstructing the fluctuation of the whole series in a high error area. By further analyzing the spatiotemporal patterns of SM with the merged product in China, we found that northeast China will become wetter whereas South China will become drier. Northwest China and the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau would change from wetting to drying under a medium emission scenario. From the temporal scale of the results, the rate of SM variations is accelerated with time in the future under different scenarios. This study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed procedure for simultaneous data fusion and spatial downscaling to generate improved SM data. The merged data have great practical and scientific implications.},

Balenzano et al. proposed the alpha approximation method in 2011 for solving some complex issues during the retrieval of soil moisture over agricultural crops with synthetic aperture radar data. However, determining the constraints and solving the underdetermined system of equations in this method add new challenges. Considering the questions of constraints and underdetermined system of equations, the alpha approximation method is used to augment the measured data, and can avoid solving the underdetermined system of equations with constraints directly. Then, these data are applied in a support vector regression machine for soil moisture estimation. It is found that when an optimal model is determined, the method proposed in this article is superior to the direct use of the alpha approximation method, and the root-mean-squared error (RMSE) decreased from 0.0775 to 0.0339 and R-2 increased from 0.0467 to 0.6491. In addition, the method obtained a good result from a data set collected that included a different growing period of crops by changing the standardized method from StandardScaler to Scale, where the RMSE is 0.0501 and R-2 is 0.3204. This indicates the good generalization capability of this method. In conclusion, the proposed method solves the two questions effectively and provides a potential way for long-time or large-scale soil moisture monitoring with much less in situ measurements.},

The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF, respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than 47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%. However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF.

Hence, an attempt has been made in this study to estimate the surface soil moisture at high spatial resolution using different high-resolution multispectral imageries from Landsat 8 OLI (Optical Land Imager) and Sentinel 2A MSI (Multi Spectral Instrument), of similar date. The thermal (10.9 mu m) and short wave infra-red (SWIR) (2.2 mu m) bands of the Landsat image and the SWIR band (2.19 mu m) of Sentinel image were used to estimate the soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 30 m and 20 m respectively, whereas the red and near infrared (NIR) bands of both the images were used to estimate the dryness. As the thermal band at high spatial resolution (at 20 m or below) is not available, this study attempted to bridge the gap and integrate mull-sensor and multi-resolution feature space utilizing various scalable procedures so as to estimate soil moisture and dryness. Limitation due to unavailability of the thermal bands in Sentinel multispectral image was overcome through a bridging procedure using Landsat thermal bands derived LST and Sentinel derived NDVI to estimate Sentinel LST at 20 m. The distribution pattern of high-resolution estimated soil moisture in each coarse spatial resolution grid (1 km) was taken into consideration to downscale the available CCI and SMAP soil moisture data. The estimated soil moisture and dryness were upscaled to 1 km and then validated using the downscaled soil moisture products (SMAP and CCI), and a significant correlation having R-2 greater than 0.8, 0.5 and 0.4 was observed for the thermal band derived soil moisture, short wave band derived soil moisture, and the red and NIR band derived dryness, respectively. To understand the temporal variability of the soil moisture, data from three different seasons representing extreme soil moisture conditions (winter, summer and monsoon) were analyzed and found that the independently estimated soil moisture had errors in temporal continuity and spatial spread. Hence, the estimated soil moisture was standardized using annual information which resulted in more accurate products, and the SWIR Transformed Reflectance (STR) derived soil moisture was more accurate than LST derived product.},

Preprocessing methods and other variables were also analyzed. In this comment paper, some misuses of Kappa statistic in the original paper by dos Santos Teixeira et al. are discussed. The authors calculated Cohen's kappa coefficient to make categorical predictions for soil fertility classes. However, using Cohen's Kappa to estimate the intra-rater reliabilities (IRRs) is not appropriate on the condition of ordinal categorical variables in four or five categories in the original paper. We briefly introduce the Kappa statistic for evaluation of IRR between two raters and propose to use weighted Kappa to compute IRRs under such conditions. To conclude, we recognize that this does not significantly alter the conclusions of this paper, but it is necessary to ensure that the appropriate statistical tools are used.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a critical variable influencing plant water uptake, rainfall-runoff partitioning, and near-surface atmospheric conditions. Soil moisture measurements are typically made using either in-situ sensors or by collecting samples, both methods which have a small spatial footprint or, in recent years, by remote sensing satellites with large spatial footprints. The cosmic ray neutron sensor (CRNS) is a proximal technology which provides estimates of field-averaged soil moisture within a radius of up to 240 m from the sensor, offering a much larger sensing footprint than point measurements and providing field-scale information that satellite soil moisture observations cannot capture. Here we compare volumetric soil moisture estimates derived from a novel, less expensive lithium (Li) foil-based CRNS to those from a more expensive commercially available He-3-based CRNS, to measurements from in-situ sensors, and to four intensive surveys of soil moisture in a field with highly variable soil texture. Our results indicate that the accuracy of the Li foil CRNS is comparable to that of the commercially available sensors (MAD = 0.020 m(3) m(-3)), as are the detection radius and depth. Additionally, both sensors capture the influence of soil textural variability on field-average soil moisture. Because novel Li foil-based CRNSs are comparable in accuracy to and much less expensive than current commercially available CRNSs, there is strong potential for future adoption by land and water managers and increased adoption by researchers interested in obtaining field-scale estimates of soil moisture to improve water conservation and sustainability.},

In this sense, the present work aimed to evaluate the reliability and precision of a low-cost sensor to determine soil moisture content. It was concluded that the evaluated sensors did not present a known precision to estimate the level of soil moisture content. A FC-28 sensor coupled with a Arduino platform was used with three different soils (texture: low, medium and heavy), moisture ranging from 15 to 50\%. The results indicated that soil texture influenced the readings, even at the same humidity. In addition, the evaluated sensors did not present replicability nor accuracy for less them 10\% moisture differences. Therefore, there is need to calibrate each sensor individually.},

In civil industries including the agriculture engineering and the forestry engineering, moisture sensors are widely used to test and monitor the engineering properties and long-term service performance of soil. The influence of multiple factors on the quality and the accuracy of the soil moisture sensor should be taken into account. Both laboratory and field tests were performed by the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method. The soil dielectric constant and magnetic permeability under different moisture contents, different temperatures, and different dry densities were comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the sensitive factors in the service performance of the TDR sensor have been revealed by the real state of tested soil samples. Based on the testing principle of TDR, a calibration calculation model has been developed to evaluate accurately the moisture content of the subgrade slope. The results show that both the moisture content and the dry density had a significant influence on the dielectric constant and the magnetic permeability of soil. The developed calculation model has a good fitting effect and stability. Through the model, the influence of moisture content and temperature on the soil dielectric constant has been analyzed, and the fitting goodness is above 90\%. After half a year of settlement, the soil was gradually drained and consolidated, and the moisture content of the subgrade section gradually decreased. It verified that the monitoring method determined by the laboratory calibration test was effective and accurate.},

The present study aimed at evaluating the trade-off between dwell time and XRF performance for assessing soil fertility attributes. A total of 102 soil samples acquired in two Brazilian agricultural fields were used, whose spectra were obtained using dwell times of 90, 60, 30, 15, 10, 7, 4, and 2 s to build and validate calibration models for clay, cation exchange capacity, and extractable K and Ca. Results revealed that it is possible to make drastic reductions in the XRF dwell time (from 90 to 2 s), while keeping excellent prediction performance [ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) between 3.52 and 8.32] for all the studied attributes. A dwell time of only 2 s performed satisfactorily and is an analysis time suitable for rapid in situ applications. In addition, it was shown that data from spectral databases previously collected that used long dwell times (e.g., 30, 60, 90 s) can be extrapolated to fast applications with shorter dwell times (e.g., 2 and 4 s), once standardization by the detector's live time has been performed. Anyhow, calibrations using a dwell time similar to the one of the validation set tended to show superior results and are therefore recommended. This study addresses the need and provides guidelines for optimizing XRF sensor analysis time for in situ applications in the context of precision agriculture.},

The field soil data from Western Australia was employed. The performance capability of extreme gradient boosting regres-sion (XGBR) together with the genetic algorithm (GA) optimizer for features selection and optimization for soil mois-ture prediction in bare lands was examined and compared with various scenarios and ML models. The proposed model (the XGBR-GA model) with 21 optimal features obtained from GA was yielded the highest performance (R-2 = 0.891; RMSE = 0.875\%) compared to random forest regression (RFR), support vector machine (SVM), and CatBoost gradient boosting regression (CBR). Conclusively, the new approach using the XGBR-GA with features from combination of reliable free-of-charge remotely sensed data from Sentinel and ALOS imagery can effectively estimate the spatial variability of soil moisture.

The objectives of this study were to assess (i) the degradation of soil moisture sensor component materials and (ii) the effects of material degradation on maize (Zea Mays L.) growth and development. This study was conducted in a greenhouse at Colorado State University, Colorado, USA, by planting maize seeds in pots filled with three growing media (field soil, silica sand, and Promix commercial potting media). The degradation rate of five candidate sensor materials (three blends of beeswax and soy wax, balsa wood, and PHBV (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate))) was assessed by harvesting sensor materials at four maize growth stages (30, 60, 90, and 120 days after transplanting). All materials under consideration showed stability in terms of mass and dimension except PHBV. PHBV was degraded entirely within 30 days in soil and Promix, and within 60 days in sand. Balsa wood did now show any significant reduction in mass and dimensions in all growth media. Similarly, there was no significant mass loss across wax blends (p = 0.05) at any growth stage, with a few exceptions. Among the wax blends, 3:1 (beeswax:soy wax) was the most stable blend in terms of mass and dimension with no surface cracks, making it a suitable encapsulant for soil sensor. All materials under consideration did not have any significant effect on maize growth (dry biomass, green biomass, and height) as compared to control plants. These results indicated that 3:1 beeswax:soy wax blend, PHBV, and balsa wood could be suitable candidates for various components of biodegradable soil moisture sensors.},

The device employed a conductivity cell with copper electrodes, connected in series with a resistor, powered using an oscillating power source. Griess reaction-based photometric detection using an LED and photodiode was used to quantify nitrite. A transimpedance amplifier circuit was designed and fabricated to amplify the photodiode output. pH detection was achieved using a commercially available pH probe and an Arduino pH breakout board. A low-cost 3D printed syringe pump was developed to achieve flow control. Atmega 328P (onboard Arduino Uno) was used to integrate the subsystems.

	abstract = {The accuracy and precision of the cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS) neutron count and soil moisture estimate are affected differently by distinct neutron moderating factors. Moreover, whereas the accuracy can be improved by correcting for different hydrogen pools, the precision can only be improved by increasing the surface area of the CRNS sensors or by increasing the integration time. To date, the effects of different neutron moderating factors on CRNS accuracy and precision are not completely understood. We used data from three agricultural and low biomass sites located within a few kilometres distance from each other in South England. We developed an extended version of the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Interaction Code (COSMIC), which included the effects of relevant neutron moderating factors on the neutron counts. With sensitivity analysis, we found atmospheric pressure and soil moisture content to be most influential on neutron count accuracy and precision. These two factors were, respectively, seven and four times more important than soil bulk density, lattice water and soil organic matter. Above ground biomass was substantially less influential compared to these variables. However, because the three sites had similar soil organic matter and meteorology, calibration results showed that differences between sites could be mostly explained by differences in above ground biomass and to a lesser extent intercepted water. The neutron count differences due to above ground biomass corresponded with substantial soil moisture estimate differences up to 0.07cm3cm-3; a significant effect on soil moisture accuracy. The precision of the soil moisture estimate was 10 times more sensitive to soil moisture than other factors and was therefore mostly a function of soil moisture content itself. The neutron count integration times required to obtain a soil moisture precision were typically less than a day. Our results are indicative for other humid, temperate, agricultural sites.},

Simulation and rover measurements for a transect crossing between grass and concrete additionally suggest that (d) SM changes can be sensed over a length scales of tens of meters or less (roughly an order of magnitude smaller than commonly used footprint distances), and (e) the additional moderator does not reduce the detected neutron count rate (and hence increase noise) as much as might be expected given the extent of the additional moderator.

Remote sensing approaches capture large-scale moisture patterns but are limited in spatial and temporal resolution, while commercial field sensors remain too expensive to deploy intensively over large spatial extents. Here, we demonstrate the use of low-cost ({\textless}20 USD) custom sensors to create a large monitoring network of surficial (0-15 cm depth) volumetric soil moisture content (VMC) across Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) (NC, TN, USA). In laboratory tests, temperature-calibrated VMC values approached the accuracy of commercial probes. We deployed over 80 sensors across multiple watersheds, topographic positions, and a 1,800-m elevation gradient, and created hierarchical models to understand associations of VMC with spatial (30-m resolution) and temporal (daily) variables related to water supply and demand. Elevation had the strongest association with VMC, with a fivefold increase across the gradient reflecting 1.5-fold changes in both (increased) precipitation and (decreased) evapotranspiration; slope angle was a strong mediating factor. Common proxies for moisture including topographic convergence index were not associated with VMC, likely due to limited contributions of surface drainage to local water balance. Our model predicted daily VMC of a set of validation sensors with a root mean square error of 4.8\%, which may be improved by site-specific field calibration. Our study indicates that spatially extensive, field-based soil moisture networks are practical, accurate, and an important component of regional environmental monitoring.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is important for understanding climate, water resources, water storage, and land use management. This study used Sentinel-2 (S-2) satellite optical data to retrieve surface soil moisture at a 10 m scale on grassland sites with low hydraulic conductivity soil in a climate dominated by heavy rainfall. Soil moisture was estimated after modifying the Optical Trapezoidal Model to account for mixed land cover in such conditions. The method uses data from a short-wave infra-red band, which is sensitive to soil moisture, and four vegetation indices from optical bands, which are sensitive to overlying vegetation. Scatter plots of these data from multiple, infrequent satellite passes are used to define the range of surface moisture conditions. The saturated and dry edges are clearly non-linear, regardless of the choice of vegetation index. Land cover masks are used to generate scatter plots from data only over grassland sites. The Enhanced Vegetation Index demonstrated advantages over other vegetation indices for surface moisture estimation over the entire range of grassland conditions. In poorly drained soils, the time lag between satellite surface moisture retrievals and in situ sensor soil moisture at depth must be part of the validation process. This was achieved by combining an approximate solution to the Richards' Equation, along with measurements of saturated and residual moisture from soil samples, to optimise the correlations between measurements from satellites and sensors at a 15 cm depth. Time lags of 2-4 days resulted in a reduction of the root mean square errors between volumetric soil moisture predicted from S-2 data and that measured by in situ sensors, from similar to 0.1 m(3)/m(3) to {\textless}0.06 m(3)/m(3). The surface moisture results for two grassland sites were analysed using statistical concepts based upon the temporal stability of soil water content, an ideal framework for the intermittent Sentinel-2 data in conditions of persistent cloud cover. The analysis could discriminate between different natural drainages and surface soil textures in grassland areas and could identify sub-surface artificial drainage channels. The techniques are transferable for land-use and agricultural management in diverse environmental conditions without the need for extensive and expensive in situ sensor networks.},

One of the main challenges of SMWSNs in practical applications is to maximize the coverage area under certain conditions of monitoring area and to minimize the number of nodes used. Therefore, a new adaptive Cauchy variant butterfly optimization algorithm (ACBOA) has been designed to effectively improve the network coverage. More importantly, new Cauchy variants and adaptive factors for improving the global and local search ability of ACBOA, respectively, are designed. In addition, a new coverage optimization model for SMWSNs that integrates node coverage and network quality of service is developed. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is compared with other swarm intelligence algorithms, namely, butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), artificial bee colony algorithm (ABC), fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA), and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO), under the conditions of a certain initial population size and number of iterations for the fairness and objectivity of simulation experiments. The simulation results show that the coverage rate of SMWSNs after ACBOA optimization increases by 9.09\%, 13.78\%, 2.57\%, and 11.11\% over BOA, ABC, FOA, and PSO optimization, respectively.},

The first derivative of the reciprocal logarithm of the reflectance and the sensitive band was extracted using the correlation coefficient method, and the correlation of the content of soil organic matter, phosphorus, and potassium was solved. The BA is used to optimize the two core parameters of the AdaBoost model (i.e., the maximum number of iterations (n) and the weight reduction coefficient (v) of the weak learner), the classification and regression trees(CART) decision tree is selected as the weak regression learner of the model, and the coefficient of determination is used as parameter optimization. Based on the objective function value, a BA-AdaBoost model was constructed to estimate soil organic matter and phosphorus and potassium contents. The results show that the BA-AdaBoost combined model can better search for globally optimal parameters. The AdaBoost model optimized by BA significantly improved accuracy and reliability. Among the three elements, soil organic matter estimation accuracy is the highest, and the coefficient of determination and the root mean square error are 0.867 and 0.151g . kg(-1), respectively. Compared with the model before optimization, the model accuracy and reliability improved by 29.0\% and 24.1\%, respectively.

The feasibility of the framework was validated in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the Sentinel-2/3 fused image generated by Fit-FC was visually the closest to the true image, followed by ESTARFM, FSDAF, and STFMF. The spatiotemporal fusion-machine learning estimation framework provided reliable estimation for multi-layer (0 20, 20 40 and 40 60 cm) soil water in the irrigation area. The dense time series of soil water generated by the framework facilitated the detection of irrigation events in the irrigated farmland. Our findings highlighted the effectiveness of Sentinel-2/3 fused images in providing high- resolution continuous daily monitoring of farmland soil water on a large scale. These high spatial-temporal resolution time series are valuable for monitoring crop growth and water resource management, contributing to further expanding the application of satellite remote sensing in precision agriculture.},

	abstract = {The estimation of topsoil water content is of primary interest in the framework of precision fanning, but, in general, such assessment is costly and complicated by several interfering factors which do not allow an accurate prediction. Proximal sensing can provide suitable technological facilities to support researchers and technicians in this task. GPR and EMI sensors are valuable instruments as they can provide very informative covariates to be used for improving soil water content estimation. In the present work, it was explored the single (EMI or GPR) and the combined (EMI + GPR) contribution of these proximal data sources. Furthermore, geostatistical (Ordinary Kriging and Kriging with external drift) and linear mixed effects models were applied to compare their respective predictive capabilities. As a result, GPR demonstrated to be more effective in estimating topsoil water content with respect to EMI but, combining both the information, an improvement in the prediction accuracy was observed. Moreover, adding more covariates in the models (GPR outcomes or GPR + EMI outcomes) allowed filtering out the structured spatial component of soil water content. Finally, the statistical approaches proved to behave very similarly, with a slight better performance of Kriging with external drift.},

	abstract = {Deriving soil moisture content (SMC) at the regional scale with different spatial and temporal land cover changes is still a challenge for active and passive remote sensing systems, often coped with machine learning methods. So far, the reference measurements of the data-driven approaches are usually based on point data, which entails a scale gap to the resolution of the remote sensing data. Cosmic Ray Neutron Sensing (CRNS) indirectly provides SMC estimates of a soil volume covering more than 1 ha and vertical depth up to 80 cm and is thus able to narrow this scale gap. So far, the CRNS-based SMC has only been used as validation source of remote sensing based SMC products. Its beneficial large sensing volume, especially in depth, has not been exploited yet. However, the sensing volume of the CRNS, which is changing with hydrological conditions, bears challenges for the comparison with remote sensing observations. This study, for the fist time, aims to understand the direct linkage of optical (Sentinel 2) and SAR (Sentinel 1) data with CRNS-based SMC. Thereby, the CRNS-based SMC is obtained by an experimental CRNS cluster that covers the high temporal and spatial SMC variability of an entire pre-alpine subcatchment. Using different Random Forest regressions, we analyze the potentials and limitations of both remote sensing sensors to follow the CRNS-based SMC signal. Our results show that it is possible to link the CRNS-based SMC signal with SAR and optical remote sensing observations via Random Forest modelling. We found that Sentinel 2 data is able to separate wet from dry periods with a R2 of 0.68. It is less affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal and it is able to assign a land cover specific SMC distribution. However, Sentinel 2 regression models are not accurate (R2 {\textless} 0.21) in mapping the CRNSbased SMC for the frequently mowed grassland areas of the study site. It requires soil type and topographical information to accurately follow the CRNS-based SMC signal with Random Forest regression. Sentinel 1 data instead is affected by the changing soil volume that contributes to the CRNS-based SMC signal. It has reasonable model performance (R2 = 0.34) when the CRNS data correspond to surface SMC. Also for Sentinel 1 the retrieval is impacted by the mowing activities at the test site. When separating the CRNS data set into dry and wet periods, soil properties and topography are the main drivers of SMC estimation. Sentinel 1 or Sentinel 2 data add the existing temporal variability to the regression models. The analysis underlines the need of combining optical and SAR observations (Sentinel 1, Sentinel 2) as well as soil property and topographical information to understand and follow the CRNS-based SMC signal for different hydrological conditions and land cover types.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, a wide range of applications require near-real-time Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) data at high spatial resolution. However, operational passive microwave systems like SMOS and SMAP can only acquire such information at a relatively coarser resolution. Therefore, several downscaling algorithms have been developed to address this issue and provide SSM maps at a finer spatial scale. Users may, however, find it difficult to implement the downscaling algorithm due to the complexity of integrating various data sources. Disaggregation based on Physical and Theoretical scale Change (DisPATCh) is one of the algorithms that is widely accepted to downscale passive microwave SSM observations. But the complexity of modeling, the variety of data sources and formats of input data make it very difficult for users to implement the algorithm. Thus, we developed a Satellitebased Hydrological Monitoring System (SHMS), which facilitates this gap through the implementation of the DisPATCh algorithm to generate large-scale SSM maps with high resolution, which is achieved by combining SMAP and MODIS products. The System Usability Scale (SUS) method was used to evaluate the system's strengths and weaknesses. The SUS evaluation results show that 74.75\% of SHMS users are satisfied with the system's performance.},

The organic materials applied 7.3-7.5 g N m(-2) and 3.2-4.7 g P m(-2), which supplied 142\% +/- 37\% of the N and 429\% +/- 125\% of the P present in the ear of rice at harvest in plots without winter flooding. The rates of organic materials applied would maintain soil N and P content. Winter flooding increased the ammonium concentration in the soil solution, straw dry matter at harvest, and available N in the plow layer during winter. Our practice, which improved N supply in later growth stages and P availability, supported an adequate rice yield and a conserved available N.},

	abstract = {Accurate large-scale soil moisture (SM) maps are crucial for catchment-scale hydrological models used for water resource management and warning systems for droughts, floods, and wildfires. SM can be mapped by mobile cosmic-ray neutron (CRN) systems of moderated detectors at homogeneous landscapes of similar soil and vegetation. In this study, we present a new approach for mobile CRN detection to perform to its full potential, where CRN measurements can also be converted to SM at heterogeneous landscapes. The approach is based solely on thermal and epithermal neutron datasets obtained from mobile dual-spectra CRN detection, combined with theoretical developments using a particle transport model. For each measurement point, the land cover type is identified using the thermal-to-epithermal (T/E) ratio, and the relevant neutron-count-to-soil-moisture conversion function is estimated from CRN stations located at the main land cover types in the catchment. With this approach, the requirement of collecting 100+ soil samples for each point along the survey route is omitted. We use this T/E-dependent approach to obtain SM maps from 12 CRN surveys and compare it with a simple approach where only the conversion function from the agricultural site is used. SM by the simple approach is comparable to the estimates of the agricultural stations of a capacitance sensor network, while the estimates of the T/E-dependent approach also compare well with the heathland and forest stations. With accurate SM estimates for all landcover types, the average error is reduced from 0.089 to 0.038 when comparing CRN SM with space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission estimates.

	abstract = {The intercropping-led diversified tillage is crucial for sustainable development in dryland agriculture. However, the plant-plant interaction transition and its effects on soil physiochemical characteristics along soil phosphorus (P) levels are not clear. To address this issue, maize-grass pea intercropping system was used to investigate the variations in plant-plant facilitation along soil P gradients (low- to high-P) and their effects on rhizosphere soil N and P availability and microbial biomass. The data showed that total net effect (NE) was always positive, indicating facilitative effects of intercropping on total community productivity. Specifically, the relative yield (RY) for both species was greater than 0.5 in the P-deficient soils, representing mutually facilitated effects. Yet, under the P-sufficient condition, maize and grass pea acted as facilitated species and facilitator respectively. Rhizosphere phosphatase activity was significantly enhanced in the P-deficient soils, accordingly fostering P mineralization for higher P availability and N utilization. The contents of microbial biomass carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (i.e., MBC, MBN and MBP) were evidently elevated in intercropping systems than those of mono-culture. Also, global meta-analysis verified above phenomenon, showing that high P addition decreased facilitation intensity with type shift, regarding plant productivity, N and P utilization and vice versa. We confirmed a relatively full picture of P-driven facilitation intensity and type shift along stress gradients by field observation and meta-analysis. The findings provided a new insight of biodiversity in soil physiochemical traits and also revealed a critical mechanism affecting resource utilization in the P-limited soils.},

Users can freely retrieve the data from this database through an online web portal (https://ismn.earth/en/, last access: 28 October 2021). Meanwhile, the ISMN has evolved into the primary in situ soil moisture reference database worldwide, as evidenced by more than 3000 active users and over 1000 scientific publications referencing the data sets provided by the network. As of July 2021, the ISMN now contains the data of 71 networks and 2842 stations located all over the globe, with a time period spanning from 1952 to the present. The number of networks and stations covered by the ISMN is still growing, and approximately 70 \% of the data sets contained in the database continue to be updated on a regular or irregular basis. The main scope of this paper is to inform readers about the evolution of the ISMN over the past decade, including a description of network and data set updates and quality control procedures.

In current study, a soil moisture data assimilation framework has been developed by using the Community Land Model version 4.5 (CLM4.5) and the proper orthogonal decomposition (POD)-based ensemble four-dimensional variational assimilation (PODEn4DVar) algorithm. Assimilation experiments were conducted at four agricultural sites in Pakistan by assimilating in-situ soil moisture observations. The results showed that it was a reliable system. To quantify further the feasibility of the data assimilation (DA) system, soil moisture observations from the top four soil-depths (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm) were assimilated. The evaluation results indicated that the DA system improved soil moisture estimation. In addition, updating the soil moisture in the upper soil layers of CLM4.5 could improve soil moisture estimation in deeper soil layers [layer 7 (L7, 62.0 cm) and layer 8 (L8, 103.8 cm)]. To further evaluate the DA system, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) were designed for Pakistan by assimilating daily observations. These idealized experiments produced statistical results that had higher correlation coefficients, reduced root mean square errors, and lower biases for assimilation, which showed that the DA system is able to produce and improve soil moisture estimation in Pakistan.},

A two-year field trial was conducted where N (0 or 250 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) and P (0 or 50 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were applied in a full factorial design to an intensively managed grass-pasture system. Changes in plant growth and nutrient uptake, soil microbial biomass P, soil phosphatase activities, and soil inorganic and organic P fractions were assessed by regular sampling. Phosphorus addition increased Olsen P and shoot P uptake but not shoot biomass compared to the control. In contrast, N addition decreased Olsen P by 23\% but increased both shoot biomass and P uptake by 1.6-fold, compared to the control. Microbial biomass P was irresponsive to N and P additions. Phosphatase enzyme activity significantly increased in summer under N addition, which was linked to labile organic P mineralization. After two growing seasons, N addition alone significantly decreased readily-available inorganic P, labile inorganic P, moderately labile inorganic P, and labile organic P by 75, 19, 7, and 28\%, respectively, compared to the control. On the other hand, combined N and P addition significantly decreased readily-available inorganic P, labile inorganic P, and labile organic P by 39, 26, and 28\%, respectively, but had no impact on moderately labile inorganic P compared to P addition alone. The findings of this study revealed that short-term N fertilization to N-limited grass-pastures can accelerate P cycling by mobilizing labile inorganic and organic P as well as moderately labile inorganic P pools. However, N fertilization combined with P applications exceeding plant requirements cannot mobilize moderately labile inorganic P, which accumulates under high P sorbing soils.},

Remote sensing is viable source of soil moisture data in instrument-scarce areas. However, space-based soil moisture estimates lack suitability for daily and high-resolution agricultural, hydrological, and environmental applications. This study aimed to assess the potential of the random forest machine learning technique to enhance the spatial resolution of remote soil moisture products from the SMAP satellite. Models were built using random forest for spatial downscaling of SMAP-L3-E, then visually and statistically evaluated for disaggregation quality. The impact of topography, soil properties, and precipitation on the downscaled soil moisture was examined. The relationship between downscaled soil moisture and in-situ soil moisture was analyzed. The results indicate that the proposed method demonstrated spatial and hydrological coherence, along with a satisfactory downscaling quality. Statistical validation indicated suitable generalization error for scientific and practical use (RMSE {\textless} 0.05 cm(3) cm(-3)). Random forest effectively achieved spatial downscaling of SMAP-L3-E in the study area. Principal component and spatial analysis revealed dependence of downscaled soil moisture on elevation, soil organic carbon content, clay content, and saturated hydraulic conductivity, mainly under near-saturation conditions. Regarding validation against in-situ data, downscaled soil moisture explained in-situ soil moisture well under low soil water content ( = 0.624). Downscaling performance deteriorates for water contents between 0.40 to 0.50 cm(3) cm(-3), suggesting inadequacy under near saturation conditions at a daily temporal frequency. However, coarser temporal aggregations (7 to 10 days) yielded an average 0.98 correlation coefficient, regardless of saturation conditions. These results could potentially be applied in irrigation planning, soil physics studies and hydrology monitoring, to forecasting the occurrence of droughts, leaching of contaminants, surface runoff modeling, carbon cycle studies, soil's capacity to store and provide nutrients.},

	abstract = {The water balance equation (WBE) describes how net water inflows into a system relate to storage changes over a time span (dt). This equation is fundamental in hydrologic studies, helping to determine water supply and elucidate the terrestrial water cycle. For land surface, the WBE links water fluxes like precipitation (P), evapotranspiration, drainage and surface runoff to soil moisture (SM) changes within a discrete soil layer (dSM). While traditional focus has been on the precision of the WBE-estimated fluxes, there has been increased recent interest in fitting the WBE using remotely-sensed P and SM data to infer water balance parameters, particularly the Delta Z that associates net fluxes and dSM within dt. However, obtaining physically interpretable WBE parameters like Delta Z is a potentially ill-posed problem due to simplifying assumptions imbedded in a WBE implementation, missing hydrologic constraints, and accuracy and revisit limitations in available remotely-sensed data. In addition, WBE parameters obtained from classical maximum likelihood estimation approaches can vary significantly. Here, using a Bayesian non-linear modeling approach, we demonstrate how these factors can impede the identification of useful Delta Z estimates. Specifically, we find that Delta Z estimates are likely to be spuriously biased due to limitations in the temporal resolution and accuracy of satellite-based dSM estimates - as well as the neglect of other hydrological components in the WBE. Maps showcasing the lower and upper bounds of the 94 \% HDI from our Bayesian model further elucidate these biases. Results suggests that estimates of Delta Z are effective in nature and great care should be exercised when attempting to interpret them physically. Instead, they should be defined as effective parameters reflecting the characteristics of their fitted remotely-sensed data sets. Drawing from current progress, accurate AZ estimates, informed by more advanced remote sensing techniques and precise WBE, will enhance our understanding of terrestrial water cycle.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an important biophysical parameter by which to evaluate water resource potential, especially for agricultural activities under the pressure of global warming. The recent advancements in different types of satellite imagery coupled with deep learning-based frameworks have opened the door for large-scale SM estimation. In this research, high spatial resolution Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter data and high temporal resolution soil moisture active passive (SMAP) SM data were combined to create short-term SM predictions that can accommodate agricultural activities in the field scale. We created a deep learning model to forecast the daily SM values by using time series of climate and radar satellite data along with the soil type and topographic data. The model was trained with static and dynamic features that influence SM retrieval. Although the topography and soil texture data were taken as stationary, SMAP SM data and Sentinel-1 (S1) backscatter coefficients, including their ratios, and climate data were fed to the model as dynamic features. As a target data to train the model, we used in situ measurements acquired from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN). We employed a deep learning framework based on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture with two hidden layers that have 32 unit sizes and a fully connected layer. The accuracy of the optimized LSTM model was found to be effective for SM prediction with the coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.87, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.046, unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.045, and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.033. The model's performance was also evaluated concerning above-ground biomass, land cover classes, soil texture variations, and climate classes. The model prediction ability was lower in areas with high normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values. Moreover, the model can better predict in dry climate areas, such as arid and semi-arid climates, where precipitation is relatively low. The daily prediction of SM values based on microwave remote sensing data and geophysical features was successfully achieved by using an LSTM framework to assist various studies, such as hydrology and agriculture.},

Thus, using 670 SM stations worldwide, we evaluated and compared SM products from microwave remote sensing [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (C- and X-bands) and European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)], land surface model [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)], and reanalysis data [ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)] under different time scales and various climates and land covers. We find that: (a) ESA CCI and GLDAS have the closest values to the in situ SM on the annual scale, whereas others overestimate the SM; ERA-Interim (averaged R = 0.58) and ESA CCI (averaged R = 0.54) correlate best with the in situ data, while GLDAS performs worst. (b) Overall, the deviations of each product vary in seasons. ESA CCI and ERA-Interim products are closer to the in situ SM at seasonal scales, and AMSR-E and NCEP perform worst in December-February and June-August, respectively. (c) Except for NCEP and ERA-Interim, others can well reflect the intermonthly variation of the in situ SM. (d) Under various climates and land covers, AMSR-E products are less effective in cold climates, whereas GLDAS and NCEP products perform poorly in arid or temperate and dry climates. Moreover, the Bias and R of each SM product differ obviously under different forest types, especially the AMSR-E products. In summary, SM from ESA CCI is the best, followed by ERA-Interim product, and precipitation is an important auxiliary data for selecting high-quality SM stations and improving the accuracy of SM from GLDAS. These results can provide a reference for improving the accuracy of the above SM products.},

	abstract = {Non-ponded aerobic rice offers the opportunity for substantial global savings of irrigated water. Site and environment specific soil tension thresholds have been identified for non-ponded rice production to save water without adverse yield consequences. However, soil tension readings are point-source measures that are not necessarily representative of a given irrigation area/paddy and become costly when required in each paddy. Remote sensing offers spatial advantages and has been demonstrated in many crops to accurately estimate crop evapotranspiration (ETc), which is often used to schedule irrigation. This study uses soil moisture tension (SMT) data measured in a commercial aerobic rice experiment conducted in temperate Australia on a heavy clay soil to demonstrate the relationship between soil tension and remotely sensed estimated cumulative ETc between irrigation events using open access satellite imagery. The model was used to predict SMT in the second growing season during the vegetative period after establishment until PI with a root mean squared error of +/- 5.8 kPa. This demonstrates the ability of irrigators to schedule irrigation in water saving rice using open satellite-derived data that can be incorporated into an automated irrigation system, without the need for costly in-field soil moisture sensors. Future research to integrate forecast crop evapotranspiration could enable soil moisture forecasting days in advance, providing irrigators more time to plan irrigation activities.},

	abstract = {The effects of drought on tree mortality at forest stands are not completely understood. For assessing their water supply, knowledge of the small-scale distribution of soil moisture as well as its temporal changes is a key issue in an era of climate change. However, traditional methods like taking soil samples or installing data loggers solely collect parameters of a single point or of a small soil volume. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is a suitable method for monitoring soil moisture changes and has rarely been used in forests. This method was applied at two forest sites in Bavaria, Germany to obtain high-resolution data of temporal soil moisture variations. Geoelectrical measurements (2D and 3D) were conducted at both sites over several years (2015-2018/2020) and compared with soil moisture data (matric potential or volumetric water content) for the monitoring plots. The greatest variations in resistivity values that highly correlate with soil moisture data were found in the main rooting zone. Using the ERT data, temporal trends could be tracked in several dimensions, such as the interannual increase in the depth of influence from drought events and their duration, as well as rising resistivity values going along with decreasing soil moisture. The results reveal that resistivity changes are a good proxy for seasonal and interannual soil moisture variations. Therefore, 2D- and 3D-ERT are recommended as comparatively non-laborious methods for small-spatial scale monitoring of soil moisture changes in the main rooting zone and the underlying subsurface of forested sites. Higher spatial and temporal resolution allows a better understanding of the water supply for trees, especially in times of drought.},

Our results showed that the novel calculation method, which considers the vertical and horizontal structure, biomass, and the water content of the canopy, is suitable for obtaining a more accurate estimation of the vegetation canopy water content. Additionally, this improved water cloud model (IWCM) was used to retrieve the soil moisture content of often greenwood, deciduous forest, mixed forest-, composite shrub grass-, and grassland-covered areas. The tenfold cross-validation determination coefficient (R-2) of the soil moisture content model was 0.43. The relative root mean square error (rRMSE) was 21.89\%. When applied to deciduous forest, composite shrub grass, and grassland-covered areas, R-2 = 0.57 and rRMSE = 16.48\% were obtained. When the IWCM was applied only to the composite shrub grass- and grassland-covered areas, the R-2 was 0.76, and rRMSE was 9.8\%. Therefore, the IWCM provides new insights regarding the remote sensing quantitative inversion of soil moisture content in areas with high vegetation density and woodland cover, which can be applied in the future.},

This study aims to evaluate the performance of the categorical boosting algorithm (CatBoost) in comparison to other multiple-boosting algorithms for SM prediction. Appropriate feature selection is vital for achieving accurate predictions, and this study focuses on identifying relevant features and assessing CatBoost's suitability for the task. The study incorporates several boosting algorithms including Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and CatBoost to estimate SM. Results indicate that radar backscatter coefficient, soil roughness, and digital elevation model (DEM) are crucial features for SM retrieval. Comparatively, CatBoost outperforms GBDT, XGBoost, and LightGBM in various feature combinations. The most favorable results are obtained when utilizing all features as inputs for the algorithm. These optimal results yield a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.40 vol.\%, mean relative error (MRE) of 0.16 vol.\%, root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.26 vol.\%, and Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.73. Additionally, the study analyzes the inversion results for different ranges of SM and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Within the range of SM from 0 to 25 vol.\% and NDVI from 0 to 0.7, utilizing all features yields the most accurate results. Using CatBoost, this approach achieves an MAE of 1.52 vol.\%, MRE of 0.12 vol.\%, RMSE of 2.11 vol.\%, and R of 0.81. The study suggests that applying boosting algorithms, especially CatBoost, holds promise in accurately estimating surface SM.},

One of the earliest such networks is the Oklahoma Mesonet, which monitors soil matric potential using heat dissipation sensors. Various calibration equations have been proposed for those sensors, and there is a need to compare and validate the performance of those equations, especially for matric potentials {\textless} -150 kPa. A laboratory experiment was conducted in silt loam soil using a sand-kaolin box and a pressure plate apparatus with matric potentials ranging from 0 to -1500 kPa. The calibration equations included Starks' equation, Flint et al.'s equation, Schneider et al.'s equation, and a new logistic equation. The upper limit of the sensors was -9 kPa, and the sensors remained responsive at -1500 kPa matric potential. The logistic equation produced the lowest root mean squared error (34 kPa), followed by Flint et al.'s equation (192 kPa), Starks' equation (295 kPa), and Schneider et al.'s equation (463 kPa). After recalibration of the coefficients in the three preexisting equations, their performances improved, with all RMSE values {\textless}= 251 kPa; however, the logistic equation still provided superior accuracy. The logistic equation effectively removed an similar to 0.02 cm(3) cm(-3) positive bias in soil water content that resulted from use of the original parameterization of Schneider et al.'s equation. This logistic equation is recommended for use with past and future data from the Oklahoma Mesonet's heat dissipation sensors.},

	abstract = {Reanalysis and remotely sensed soil moisture (SM) products are important for monitoring hydrology and the terrestrial carbon cycle, especially in water-limited arid regions. However, it is essential to assess the reliability of SM products before they are used. In this study, surface SM from the European Reanalysis-Interim v5 (ERA5), Essential Climate Variables (ECV), the Famine Early Warning Systems Network (FEWS) Land Data Assimilation System (FLDAS), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) were assessed based on in-situ data and the Three-Cornered Hat (TCH) approach in a typical arid region, Central Asia (CA). The validation based on in -situ data indicated that all three products underestimated the observed surface SM, except for ERA5. The ERA5 SM was closest to the in-situ observations, averaging a higher correlation coefficient of 0.59, followed by the GLDAS, ECV, and FLDAS. The TCH method revealed low uncertainties ({\textless}0.05 m3/m3) for all four SM products, and high uncertainties were found at high altitudes. For ERA5 and ECV SM products, the uncertainty is high in the shrublands and forests, respectively. FLDAS and GLDAS SM products performed better in terms of uncertainty compared to ERA5 and ECV, with an average uncertainty below 0.03 m3/m3, except for forests. The above assessment results indicate that, compared with the other three SM products, ERA5 has a better performance and more potential for application in CA. There was an upward trend in surface SM from 1982 to 2018 in CA. The relationship between the four SM products and aridity index and drought events showed that GLDAS could capture the hydrothermal conditions and drought events, followed by FLDAS, ERA5, and ECV. Our research is intended to provide some reference for the application of gridded SM products to ecosystem and water resources monitoring in arid regions.},

Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) and Vegetation Drought Index (VDI) were adopted as the reference indices. Overall, SMAP outperformed SMOS in SM data validation as well as drought detection in the NCP region. A simple bias correction of the satellite SM data was able to improve their performance in characterizing agricultural drought via SM-based indices. Compared with SWDI, SMCI appeared to be the more appropriate index for drought monitoring, by showing a better agreement with both VCI and VDI in terms of drought characteristics (i.e. spatial distribution, drought category and frequency), though both SM-based indices overestimated drought severity to some extent. A simply SM-based drought indicator could be effective when satellite SM was applied for capturing agricultural drought, and a full consideration of longer term satellite data might be necessary.},

The first was the extension of the technique to a multi-constellation solution using GPS, GLONASS, and GALILEO satellites, and the second was to test whether mass-market sensors could be used for this technique. Both objectives were achieved. At the same time that the GNSS observations were made, soil samples taken at 5 cm depth were used for soil moisture determination to establish a reference data set. Based on a comparison with that reference data set, all GNSS solutions, including the three constellations and the two sensors (geodetic and mass market), were highly correlated, with a correlation coefficient between 0.7 and 0.85.},

The ensemble model developed with Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) offered a superior SSM estimate for the entire crop growth season. The ensemble model had the lowest RMSE (0.053 m3 m-3), followed by OPTRAM (SWIR2) (0.06 m3 m-3), while TOTRAM recorded the highest RMSE (0.092 m3 m-3), even though the model performances varied throughout crop growth cycles. For SSM mapping in the early phases of crop growth, WCM or TOTRAM were found superior, while during the latter growth stages, the performance of OPTRAM was better. In contrast to TOTRAM, which needs local calibration as the land surface temperature is sensitive to atmospheric conditions, the study emphasizes the shortcomings of WCM in terms of calibration requirements for changing vegetation structure utilizing in situ data. OPTRAM is suitable for generating SSM maps in semi-arid environments with a predominance of clear skies throughout the post-monsoon season. It is straightforward, low data, and resource intensive with universal surface reflectance-soil moisture association. The ensemble technique can be recommended for farm-level irrigation mapping over a post-monsoon period.},

This study aimed to employ theoretical model simulation to investigate the errors of SM retrieval due to not considering the impact of soil salinity. Then, three typical saline soil dielectric constant models were validated and compared based on the experimental measurement datasets. Results show that the WYR saline soil dielectric constant model has excellent performance. The soil salinity mainly affects the imaginary part of the dielectric constant and the effect of salinity on the soil dielectric constant is more significant when the SM has larger values. In addition, in retrieving SM with soil salinity more than 10 g/kg, the retrieval result of SM has an absolute error of 0.04 m(3)/m(3) and a relative error of 5\% when not considering the soil salinity impact. In retrieving SM with soil salinity less than 10 g/kg, the retrieved SMerror increased by 2\%, and the absolute error increased by 0.01 m(3)/m(3) as soil salinity increased by 3 g/kg.

	abstract = {In recent years, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has shown a large potential among proximal sensing techniques to monitor soil moisture noninvasively, with high frequency and a large support volume (radius up to 240 m and sensing depth up to 80 cm). This signal is, however, more sensitive to closer distances and shallower depths. Inherently, CRNS-derived soil moisture is a spatially weighted value, different from an average soil moisture as retrieved by a sensor network. In this study, we systematically test a new profile shape correction on CRNS-derived soil moisture, based on additional soil moisture profile measurements and vertical unweighting, which is especially relevant during pronounced wetting or drying fronts. The analyses are conducted with data collected at four contrasting field sites, each equipped with a CRNS probe and a distributed soil moisture sensor network. After applying the profile shape correction on CRNS-derived soil moisture, it is compared with the sensor network average. Results show that the influence of the vertical sensitivity of CRNS on integral soil moisture values is successfully reduced. One to three properly located profile measurements within the CRNS support volume improve the performance. For the four investigated field sites, the RMSE decreased 11-53\% when only one profile location was considered. We therefore recommend to install along with a CRNS at least one soil moisture profile in a radial distance {\textless}100 m and a measurement depth down to 50 cm. Profile-shape-corrected, CRNS-derived soil moisture is an unweighted integral soil moisture over the support volume, which is easier to interpret and easier to use for further applications.},

	abstract = {In this study, the ability of satellite soil moisture to track tree growth is analyzed. Despite the reticence of using satellite soil moisture data in forest areas, there is evidence that in some cases, good and reliable results have been obtained. Forests cover very important continental areas and have great importance in many natural processes related to water resources, biodiversity and climate. For these reasons, it is interesting to investigate the applicability of remote sensing soil moisture products for new applications in these environments. In the present study, the CCI (Climate Change Initiative, Global Monitoring of Essential Climate Variables, European Space Agency) soil moisture (CCISM) database has been correlated with the tree-growth series of 22 samples of Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis Mill.) in Spain in different locations and environmental conditions. Aleppo pine is the most widespread pine species in the Mediterranean basin, and therefore, it is highly representative of the bioclimatic conditions in these water-limited environments. The series spans from 1978 to 2016, and the daily CCISM has been correlated with the annual tree-growth anomalies. The daily CCISM has been obtained using a moving window scheme with 1-, 7-, 15- and 30-day averages, starting on October 1st of the previous year and finishing on December 31st of the corresponding year. Another soil moisture product (Lisflood model) and precipitation have also been used in a similar approach to strengthen the assessment analysis. The results obtained show a clear temporal pattern of the relationship between satellite soil moisture and Aleppo pine tree growth, and the influence of soil moisture on tree-growth dynamics increases with reduced water availability. The CCISM was able to detect a bimodal pattern of tree growth with a maximum in May and a secondary peak in autumn. This temporal pattern was much clearer than that obtained using the modeled soil moisture and the precipitation. This study proves that satellite soil moisture is sensitive enough to track the phenology of this forest species. The results obtained demonstrate that satellite soil moisture data could be suitable for use in forest environments and for new applications.},

Remote sensing (RS) provides long-term, high-resolution data that can contribute to the monitoring and management of natural ecosystems. Surface energy balance (SEB) methods relying on satellite remote sensing have proven effective in measuring actual evapotranspiration (ET a eb ) across different scales. However, their applicability may be constrained by interruptions in image acquisition caused by cloud cover and/or the spatio-temporal resolution limitations of satellites. In this research, a model-based methodology is suggested for simulating the dynamics of the soil - plant-atmosphere system and for estimating the daily actual evapotranspiration (ET p act ) of a Mediterranean Maquis ecosystem in northwest Sardinia. The model integrates ET a eb estimates obtained from the SEBAL model utilizing Landsat-8 data, satellite-derived vegetation indices, on-site measurements of potential evapotranspiration, and the mono-dimensional transient flow Richards equation for simulating soil moisture within the root zone. By combining these elements, the proposed model provides a more comprehensive and accurate estimate of the ET p act between Landsat acquisitions. The SEBAL model showed satisfactory performance in estimating actual evapotranspiration (ET a eb ) on satellite acquisition days, with an average error of 17 \% compared to Eddy Covariance measurements. In addition, the integrated modelling approach yielded an ET p act average estimation error of +/- 37 \% in the whole studied period. The soil moisture simulation by the model had a notable accuracy with an average error of 7.1 \%. Temporal analysis showed that the model effectively simulated ET p act and soil moisture under both dry and wet conditions, exhibiting similar monthly and daily variations as observed data. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis revealed that the stress index significantly improved the model ` s accuracy, while vegetation dynamics had a lower impact. Overall, the proposed model is a valuable tool for estimating ET p act in semi -arid Mediterranean regions, providing important information for water resource management and conservation efforts. Further application and validation of the model are recommended as new data becomes accessible, especially in areas characterized by cropped and irrigated agriculture. In future work, we aim to spatialize the Richards equation and integrate a multidimensional water balance hydrologic model.},

	abstract = {Loop-loop electromagnetic induction (EMI) has proven to be efficient for fast and real-time soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) measurements. It is important to develop robust and accurate inversion strategies to obtain soil electromagnetic conductivity image (EMCI) from ECa data. Moreover, obtaining an accurate nonlinear relationship between subsurface electrical conductivity (sigma) and water content (theta) plays a key role for soil moisture monitoring using EMI. Here, we incorporated probabilistic inversion of multi-configuration ECa data with dimensionality reduction technique through the discrete cosine transform (DCT) using training image (TI)-based parametrization to retrieve soil EMCI. The ECa data were measured repeatedly along a 10 m transect using a CMD mini-Explorer sensor. Time-lapse reference data were collected as well to benchmark the inversion results and to find the in-situ relationship between sigma and theta. To convert the inversely estimated time-lapse EMCI to the soil moisture, we examined two approaches, namely, Rhoades et al. (1976) model and artificial neural network (ANN). The proposed inversion strategy estimated the soil EMCI with an excellent agreement with the reference counterpart. Moreover, the ANN approach demonstrated superiorities than the commonly used petrophysical model of Rhoades et al. (1976) to obtain spatiotemporal images of theta from time-lapse EMCI. The results demonstrated that incorporation of the DCT-based probabilistic inversion of ECa data with the ANN approach offers a great promise for accurate characterization of the temporal wetting front and root zone soil moisture.

We tested four different machine learning algorithms and interrogated the models to rank the importance of different variables and to understand their relationship with surface soil moisture. All the machine learning algorithms we tested were able to predict soil moisture with good accuracy. The boosted regression tree algorithm was marginally the best, with a mean absolute error of 3.8\% volumetric moisture content. Variable importance analysis revealed that the four most important variables were precipitation, reflectance in the red wavelengths, potential evapotranspiration, and topographic position indices (TPI). Our results demonstrate that the dynamics of soil water status across heterogeneous terrain may be adequately described and predicted by UAS remote sensing and machine learning.

	abstract = {Soil moisture sensors are subject to uncertainty (inaccuracy) in measuring soil water status, that hinders various applications. User groups (researchers and growers/advisers) rely on these sensors for estimating critical agricultural water management decisions and information such as total soil water in the crop root zone (TSW), crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and predicting irrigation triggers (IT), i.e., when TSW is equal to or lower than readily available water. There is a lack of translation of errors in sensor-reported soil moisture (theta(v)) into TSW, ETc, and IT, which is critical to farm-level decision-making as well as research assessments. Nine soil moisture sensors (based on principles of time-domain reflectometry, capacitance and electrical resistance) were investigated in field conditions for silt loam and loamy sand soils under two installation orientations (vertical and horizontal) during two growing seasons (2017 and 2018). Accurate representation of TSW, ETc, and IT was found to be a function of sensor-type, soil-type as well as calibration-type [factory calibration (F.C.) vs. site-specific calibration (S.S.C.)]. Sensor installation orientation did not affect sensor accuracy. Uncertainties in estimation of TSW, ETc and IT were quantified under each condition of use, and sensors were comparatively ranked for effective selection. It was found that all sensors underestimated ETc in silt loam soil. The deviation of sensor-measured ETc from true ETc ranged from -14 to -31 \%, which implies that the choice of sensor under a given soil type impacts the quantification of consumptive use of the soil-vegetation system being monitored. Sensors showed both overstimation and underestimation of ETc in loamy sand soil with deviations of sensor-estimated ETc from true ETc ranging from 14 to -61 \%. The S.S.C. resulted in 45 and 17 \% improvement in TSW and ETc in silt loam soil, respectively, and 42, 80 and 86 \% improvement observed in TSW, IT and ETc in loamy sand soil, respectively. The research findings showed that suitability of soil moisture sensors can differ when different target metrics are used as criteria. These findings emphasize the need for evaluating soil moisture sensors based on practical and application-oriented criteria, in addition to reliance on theta(v) accuracy. To the best of authors' knowledge, this research is the first to translate traditional theta(v) accuracy assessments into practical and application-oriented criteria and use them to evaluate sensors for these specific applications. Sensor rankings and uncertainty associated with their use presented here will allow diverse users to effectively identify sensors for targeted applications in water management decision-making and research.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a crucial factor in the field of meteorology, hydrology, and agricultural sciences. In agricultural production, surface soil moisture (SSM) is crucial for crop yield estimation and drought monitoring. For SSM inversion, a synthetic aperture radar (SAR) offers a trustworthy data source. However, for agricultural fields, the use of SAR data alone to invert SSM is susceptible to the influence of vegetation cover. In this paper, based on Sentinel-1 microwave remote sensing data and Sentinel-2 optical remote sensing data, a convolution neural network optimized by sparrow search algorithm (SSA-CNN) was suggested to invert farmland SSM. The feature parameters were first extracted from pre-processed remote sensing data. Then, the correlation analysis between the extracted feature parameters and field measured SSM data was carried out, and the optimal combination of feature parameters for SSM inversion was selected as the input data of the subsequent models. To enhance the performance of the CNN, the hyper-parameters of CNN were optimized using SSA, and the SSA-CNN model was built for SSM inversion based on the obtained optimal hyper-parameter combination. Three typical machine learning approaches, including generalized regression neural network, random forest, and CNN, were used for comparison to show the efficacy of the suggested method. With an average coefficient of determination of 0.80, an average root mean square error of 2.17 vol.\%, and an average mean absolute error of 1.68 vol.\%, the findings demonstrated that the SSA-CNN model with the optimal feature combination had a better accuracy among the 4 models. In the end, the SSM of the study region was inverted throughout four phenological periods using the SSA-CNN model. The inversion results indicated that the suggested method performed well in local situations.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological processes in ecosystems and regulates water and energy exchanges between the surface and the atmosphere. Global coverage of surface soil moisture (SSM) satellite estimates makes them a fundamental source of information, while the validation of these estimates is usually based on in situ measurements, ideally from networks that cover areas similar to the satellite data resolution. However, as we expose in this study, both SSM data sources face challenges over extremely flat regions with large SSM variability. A homogenous farming region in the subhumid Pampas of Argentina, characterized by a large interannual rainfall variability as well as a marked annual cycle of rainfall and cropping, was taken as a case study. The region is almost devoid of irrigation and drainage infrastructure, is subject to large episodic flood and waterlogging events and holds an in situ network belonging to the Argentinean National Commission for Space Activities. This in situ network was set to evaluate the soil moisture estimated by satellite missions, such as SMAP and SAOCOM. However, several of these sites have been placed close to homesteads in a more uniform perennial vegetation than the prevailing seasonal crop. In this work, we examine how this placement bias influences SSM dynamics and its interpretation. We find that in situ data fails to capture the large seasonal and daily SSM variability caused by the cropping dynamics as well as the situation of waterlogging. As for the satellite SSM estimates, provided by the SMOS and SMAP missions in this study, while they capture the impact of cropping on SSM, data gaps can hinder robust statistical analysis. During periods of waterlogging, SSM values can lie outside the dynamic range considered valid by satellite missions, and thus are usually removed by users, creating `blind spots' for high soil water content stages in flood-prone lands. Our study underlines the importance of using multiple sources of information to interpret the hydrological status, including data from in situ measurements and remote sensing estimations of SSM as well as, when available, locally collected information such as reports from national, sub-national and private agro-industrial agencies.},

The optimal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters to characterize the soil moisture were determined based on L-band Uninhabited Aerial Vehicle Synthetic Aperture Radar (UAVSAR), C-band RADARSAT-2, and ground measurements composed of soil and vegetation parameters collected during SMAPVEX12. Linear and circular backscattering coefficients (sigma(0)) and polarimetric parameters such as correlation coefficients (rho(HHVV)) and phase difference (phi(HHVV)) between HH and VV, pedestal height (PH), entropy (H), anisotropy (A), alpha angle, surface (Ps), and double bounce (Pd) powers were used to develop the relationships with soil moisture. The analysis of these relationships shows that over the forested sites of SMAPVEX12: (a) at L-band several optimal backscattering coefficients and polarimetric parameters allow the monitoring of soil moisture, particularly the linear and circular sigma(0) (r = 0.60-0.96), Ps (r = 0.59-0.84), Pd (r = 0.60-0.82), rho(HHHV)\_30 degrees, rho(VVHV)\_30 degrees, phi(HHHV)\_30 degrees and phi(HHVV)\_30 degrees (r = 0.56-0.81). However, compared to the results obtained with sigma(0), there is no added value of the polarimetric parameters for soil moisture retrievals. (b) at C-band, only a few polarimetric parameters phi(HHHV), phi(VVHV), and phi(HHVV) are correlated with soil moisture (r = similar to 0.90). They can contribute to soil moisture retrievals over forested sites when L-band data are not available.},

To this end, experiment was conducted to monitor the SMC of winter wheat at different growth stages under different irrigation treatments in Yangling, Shaanxi, China. At a solar zenith angle of 45 degrees, multispectral remote sensing data from a UAV were collected at thirteen different monitoring zenith angles. Simultaneously, the SMC in the wheat root zone was measured. From the UAV multispectral images, spectral reflectance was extracted for the construction of vegetation indices. Then the correlation between the vegetation indices and the measured SMC was analyzed. With the vegetation indices as input variables, SMC monitoring models were constructed using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Random Forest (RF), and Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN). The study also examined the effect of specific angles (hotspot and dark spot angles) on the estimation accuracy of the SMC at the nadir angle. The results indicated that different monitoring angles significantly impact the SMC estimation accuracy. Band reflectance and vegetation indices exhibited significant peak values and angular effects at the monitoring zenith angle of 45 degrees. The models achieved the optimal inversion accuracy at the hotspot angle (at a monitoring zenith angle of 45 degrees in the solar principal plane), and the accuracy was ranked as follows: BPNN (R-2 = 0.71; RMSE = 1.69) {\textgreater} ELM (R-2 = 0.52; RMSE = 1.94) {\textgreater} RF (R-2 = 0.48; RMSE = 2.10). By eliminating shadows at the nadir angle through the threshold of dark spot, inversion accuracy similar to the hotspot direction is achieved.

But water shortages, severe groundwater over-exploitation and drought problems make it difficult to exercise the topographic resource advantages of the plain. Therefore, the precise monitoring of soil moisture is of great significance for the rational use of water resources. Soil characteristics vary in natural farmland ecosystems, crops are constrained by multiple compound stresses and the precise extraction of soil moisture stress is a difficult and critical problem. The long time series was decomposed via complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) to obtain different intrinsic mode function (IMF) components, and the statistical descriptors of each component were calculated to realize the precise discrimination of soil moisture stress. A quantitative evaluation model of soil moisture was established, and the different noise addition ratios and modeling types were set respectively to investigate the optimal inversion model. The results showed that: (1) The reconstruction error of the CEEMDAN was small and almost 0; it had a high reconstruction accuracy and was more suitable for the decomposition of the long time series. The first two components, IMF1 and IMF2, were soil moisture stress subsequences, and it could effectively reflect the moisture stress situation. (2) The inversion model performed well when epsilon was 0.05 and the model type was quadratic, with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.98, which gave a better fit and less error. (3) The overall soil moisture content in the study area was low, basically in the range of 6.9\% to 15.7\%, with the central part, especially the south-central part, being the most affected by soil moisture stress, and the overall impact of soil moisture stress showed a decreasing trend from February to May. The utilization of CEEMDAN further enhances the accuracy of soil moisture inversion in agricultural fields, realizing the effective application of remote sensing observation technology and time-frequency analysis technology in the field of soil moisture research.},

	abstract = {As a basic agricultural parameter in the formation, transformation, and consumption of surface water resources, soil moisture has a very important influence on the vegetation growth, agricultural production, and healthy operation of regional ecosystems. The Aksu river basin is a typical semi-arid agricultural area which seasonally suffers from water shortage. Due to the lack of knowledge on soil moisture change, the water management and decision-making processes have been a difficult issue for local government. Therefore, soil moisture monitoring by remote sensing became a reasonable way to schedule crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Compared to in situ measurements, the use of remote sensing for the monitoring of soil water content is convenient and can be repetitively applied over a large area. To verify the applicability of the typical drought index to the rapid acquisition of soil moisture in arid and semi-arid regions, this study simulated, compared, and validated the effectiveness of soil moisture inversion. GF-1 WFV images, Landsat 8 OLI images, and the measured soil moisture data were used to determine the Perpendicular Drought Index (PDI), the Modified Perpendicular Drought Index (MPDI), and the Vegetation Adjusted Perpendicular Drought Index (VAPDI). First, the determination coefficients of the correlation analyses on the PDI, MPDI, VAPDI, and measured soil moisture in the 0-10, 10-20, and 20-30 cm depth layers based on the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI images were good. Notably, in the 0-10 cm depth layers, the average determination coefficient was 0.68; all models met the accuracy requirements of soil moisture inversion. Both indicated that the drought indices based on the Near Infrared (NIR)-Red spectral space derived from the optical remote sensing images are more sensitive to soil moisture near the surface layer; however, the accuracy of retrieving the soil moisture in deep layers was slightly lower in the study area. Second, in areas of vegetation coverage, MPDI and VAPDI had a higher inversion accuracy than PDI. To a certain extent, they overcame the influence of mixed pixels on the soil moisture spectral information. VAPDI modified by Perpendicular Vegetation Index (PVI) was not susceptible to vegetation saturation and, thus, had a higher inversion accuracy, which makes it performs better than MPDI's in vegetated areas. Third, the spatial heterogeneity of the soil moisture retrieved by the GF-1 WFV and Landsat 8 OLI image were similar. However, the GF-1 WFV images were more sensitive to changes in the soil moisture, which reflected the actual soil moisture level covered by different vegetation. These results provide a practical reference for the dynamic monitoring of surface soil moisture, obtaining agricultural information and agricultural condition parameters in arid and semi-arid regions.},

	abstract = {Inland open water bodies often pose a systematic error source in the passive remote sensing retrievals of soil moisture. Water temperature is a necessary variable used to compute water emissions that is required to be subtracted from satellite observation to yield actual emissions from the land portion, which in turn generates accurate soil moisture retrievals. Therefore, overestimation of soil moisture can often be corrected using concurrent water temperature data in the overall mitigation procedure. In recent years, several data sets of lake water temperature have become available, but their specifications and accuracy have rarely been investigated in the context of passive soil moisture remote sensing on a global scale. For this reason, three lake temperature products were evaluated against in-situ measurements from 2007 to 2011. The data sets include the lake surface water temperature (LSWT) from Global Observatory of Lake Responses to Environmental Change (GloboLakes), the Copernicus Global Land Operations Cryosphere and Water (C-GLOPS), as well as the lake mix-layer temperature (LMLT) from the European Centers for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 Land Reanalysis. GloboLakes, C-GLOPS, and ERA5 Land have overall comparable performance with Pearson correlations (R) of 0.87, 0.92 and 0.88 in comparison with in-situ measurements. LSWT products exhibit negative median biases of -0.27 K (GloboLakes) and -0.31 K (C-GLOPS), whereas the median bias of LMLT is 1.56 K. When mapped from their respective native resolutions to a common 9 km Equal-Area Scalable Earth (EASE) Grid 2.0 projection, similar relative performance was observed. LMLT and LSWT data are closer in performance over the 9 km grid cells that exhibit a small range of lake cover fractions (0.05-0.5). Despite comparable relative performance, ERA5 Land shows great advantages in spatial coverage and temporal resolution. In summary, an integrated evaluation on data accuracy, long-term availability, global coverage, temporal resolution, and regular forward processing with modest data latency led us to conclude that LMLT from the ERA5 Land Reanalysis product represents the most optimal path for use in the development of a long-term soil moisture product.},

This research presents an improved change detection method that leverages time series data from Sentinel-1 radar and Sentinel-2 optical sensors (2019-2021) to estimate surface soil moisture. The response of backscatter to soil moisture in bare soil was expressed in a logarithmic form, and the influence function of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) on the backscatter difference was established for various vegetation-covered surfaces. Therefore, the impact of vegetation on backscatter is effectively mitigated, and the resulting change in backscatter relative to bare soil conditions can be obtained. An empirical function is subsequently formulated to ascertain the reference values of soil moisture in each pixel. The retrieval of soil moisture is demonstrated in the Wudaoliang permafrost region of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau and validated against ground measurements. The retrieval results of the improved change detection method exhibit correlation coefficients ranging from 0.672 to 0.941, with root mean squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.031 \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3 to 0.073 \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3. Compared to the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) 9-km product, our new method demonstrates higher correlation (0.898 vs. 0.867) and lower RMSE (0.037 \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3 vs. 0.044{\textbackslash} \{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}/\{m{\textless}{\textasciicircum}{\textgreater}3\}{\textbackslash}m3/m3). The soil moisture retrieved from Sentinel shows a strong correlation with the SMAP 9-km soil moisture in the time series, thereby providing a better representation of the region's soil moisture heterogeneity. Our method demonstrates the feasibility of combining Sentinel-1 and 2 for high-resolution (100 m) soil moisture mapping in permafrost regions.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is the primary variable regulating the soil temperature (ST) differences between daytime and night-time, providing protection to crop rooting systems against sharp and sudden changes. It also has a number of practical applications in a range of disciplines. This study presents an approach to incorporating the effect of ST for the accurate estimation of SM using Earth Observation (EO) data from NASA's SMAP sensor, one of the most sophisticated satellites currently in orbit. Linear regression analysis was carried out between the SMAP-retrieved SM and ground-measured SM. Subsequently, SMAP-derived ST was incorporated with SMAP-derived SM in multiple regression analysis to improve the SM retrieval accuracy. The ability of the proposed method to estimate SM under different seasonal conditions for the year 2016 was evaluated using ground observations from the Wales Soil Moisture Network (WSMN), located in Wales, United Kingdom, as a reference. Results showed reduced retrieval accuracy of SM between the SMAP and ground measurements. The R-2 between the SMAP SM and ground-observed data from WSMN was found to be 0.247, 0.183, and 0.490 for annual, growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. The values of RMSE between SMAP SM and WSMN observed SM are reported as 0.080 m(3)m(-3), 0.078 m(3)m(-3) and 0.010 m(3)m(-3), with almost zero bias values for annual, growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. Implementation of the proposed scheme resulted in a noticeable improvement in SSM prediction in both R-2 (0.558, 0.440 and 0.613) and RMSE (0.045 m(3)m(-3), 0.041 m(3)m(-3) and 0.007 m(3)m(-3)), with almost zero bias values for annual, growing and non-growing seasons, respectively. The proposed algorithm retrieval accuracy was closely matched with the SMAP target accuracy 0.04 m(3)m(-3). In overall, use of the new methodology was found to help reducing the SM difference between SMAP and ground-measured SM, using only satellite data. This can provide important assistance in improving cases where the SMAP product can be used in practical and research applications.},

	doi = {10.3390/rs12101671},
	abstract = {The resolution of current satellite surface soil moisture (SM) estimates is very low, of tens of kilometers, which proves to be insufficient for various agricultural and hydrological applications. Amongst the existing downscaling approaches of remotely sensed SM, DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on a Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) improves the resolution of SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) soil moisture data using soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimates at high resolution (HR) and a SEE(SM) model implemented at low resolution (LR). Defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation, SEE can be derived from the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The current version of DISPATCH uses a linear SEE(SM) model. This study aims at improving the SEE(SM) model and testing different calibration strategies, to ultimately have more robust and better downscaled SM products. A nonlinear SEE(SM) model is introduced and its influence on the derived HR SM products is studied over a range of conditions. Each model, linear and nonlinear, is calibrated from remote sensing data on a daily and a multi-date basis. The approaches were tested over two mixed dry and irrigated areas in Catalonia, Spain, and over one dry area in Morocco. When using the linear model, better statistical results were generally obtained using a daily calibration (current version of DISPATCH), most notably over one Spanish site. However, the best results were systematically obtained for an annually calibrated nonlinear model, in terms of all metrics considered: correlation coefficient, slope of the linear regression, bias, unbiased root mean square error. In particular, when using the annually calibrated nonlinear SEE (SM) model, the temporal slope of the linear regression between disaggregated and in situ soil moisture increased to 1.16 and 0.75 for one Spanish site and for the Moroccan site (as opposed to 0.44 and 0.58, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily calibration). The temporal correlation coefficient increased to 0.47 and 0.54 over the Spanish sites (as opposed to 0.18 and 0.27, respectively, when using the linear model with a daily calibration). Those contrasted results indicate compensation effects between the model type and the calibration strategy. Taking into account studies that report the strong nonlinear behavior of the SEE with respect to SM, the introduction of the nonlinear SEE(SM) model in DISPATCH, combined with a multi-date calibration, is proven to perform significantly better under various conditions, leading to more robust disaggregated SM products. The SEE modeling based on the nonlinear SM model, with a multi-date calibration, could be integrated into the CATDS-Centre Aval de Traitement des Donnees SMOS as a future product, as well as into existing evapotranspiration models, which are based on a combination of thermal and microwave data.},

Therefore, understanding the flow and solute transport in unsaturated gravel material is of utmost importance for the protection of drinking water resources. Experimental investigations of flow and transport processes are dependent on suitable sensor technology, but it is a considerable challenge to install soil moisture sensors in gravelly material. In this note, we developed a novel method to install soil moisture sensors with minimal disturbance in a large lysimeter with undisturbed gravelly sedimentary material, based on drilling access cavities in frozen material. We investigated whether it is possible to obtain reliable soil moisture measurements and found that the probes measured the flow dynamics pattern well but could not quantify realistic absolute water content values.},

In this framework, LSTM layers are applied to extract the complicated, long- and short-term dependencies from the time series soil moisture data. Besides, the attention mechanism is employed to learn the discriminative information from the extracted features. The genetic algorithm (GA), which aims to enhance the prediction accuracy, is applied to simultaneously determine the hyperparameters of the proposed network, called the GA-LSTM-ATT, consisting of the LSTM layer count, the hidden units in layers, the rate of dropout, and the learning rate.

	abstract = {The feasibility of soil moisture retrieval from C-band Sentinel-1 data has been widely acknowledged, with preoperational 1-km products currently available at regional and/or continental scale using the long-term (LTCD) or short-term change detection (STCD) methods. Both algorithms share the same assumptions of time-invariant roughness and vegetation, which can be questionable even for a short period of 4 Sentinel-1 acquisitions (18-36 days). An advanced change detection (ACD) method is proposed in this study for an improved soil moisture retrieval from Sentinel-1 data, including two main modifications with respect to the existing STCD methods: i) approximating the effect of temporal varying vegetation on the Sentinel-1 backscatter as a variation in the two-way attenuation, and ii) a temporal soil moisture constraint based on the coarse Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) soil moisture product to partly remove the uncertainty caused by vegetation and/or roughness changes. The evaluation, based on time-series observations from 34 OzNet stations and ground samples collected during the Fifth Soil Moisture Active and Passive Experiment (SMAPEx-5) showed that the ACD improved the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE) and un biased RMSE (ubRMSE), achieving 0.66, 0.071 m3/m3 and 0.071 m3/m3 at the point scale, 0.77, 0.063 m3/m3 and 0.051 m3/m3 at 1-km scale, 0.80, 0.055 m3/m3 and 0.050 m3/m3 at 3-km scale. The contribution of the two modifications was further investigated using 559 stations from 22 networks across the world, showing that: i) the two modifications can increase R by 0.08-0.13 and reduce the retrieval RMSE by 0.009-0.013 m3/m3 (10\% - 15\% relative), and ii) the retrieval over densely vegetated areas or areas with large temporal vegetation variation can benefit more from the proposed modifications. The ACD achieved stable performance for various Sentinel-1 orbits/passes and maintained a stable performance for retrieval windows up to 30 Sentinel-1 acquisitions, providing a promising alternative for achieving consistent soil moisture retrievals from Sentinel-1.},

	abstract = {The global soil moisture (SM) retrievals by the spaceborne Global Navigation Satellite System-Reflectometry (GNSS-R) are significantly influenced by the presence of water bodies. The traditional method is to build a grid based on the location of satellite sampling points and determine the presence or absence of water bodies. In this article, we propose a water body removal method for global spaceborne GNSS-R SM retrievals that combines water bodies and buffers derived from the marginal areas around water bodies as mask data, thus achieving accurate removal of the water body and avoiding margin effects. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the Cyclone GNSS (CYGNSS) data with two different spatial resolutions (36 and 3 km) were used for SM retrieval, and the Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) Radiometer SM as well as the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) were used as references. Results show that the correlation coefficient ( {\textbackslash}R{\textbackslash} ) and root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the 36-km grid are 0.50 and 0.057 cm3/cm3, respectively, while the {\textbackslash}R{\textbackslash} and RMSE of the 3-km grid are 0.68 and 0.041cm3/cm3, respectively. Such performances are better than the traditional method. Moreover, the method proposed in this article preserves more grids. Take the 3-km spatial resolution, for example, it preserves 2.2-fold grids more than the traditional water body removal method. In the comparison with SMAP SM, the overall improvement of RMSE by using the water body removal method proposed in this article is 16.3\% (8.2\% for the traditional method). In the in situ validation, the overall improvement of RMSE is 19.4\% (-1.2\% for the traditional method). Therefore, in the future high spatial resolution SM retrieval, the water body removal method proposed in this article can preserve the maximum area and effectively eliminate the influence of water bodies on SM retrieval.},

The time series of rainfall and moisture were used in an inversion algorithm to obtain the geotechnical parameters of the soil. Then the geotechnical model was used in a forward calculation with the rainfall prediction to obtain the soil moisture forecast.

To quantitatively evaluate the hyperspectral monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC): the SMC and its corresponding spectral reflectance were measured in the laboratory. In addition, the original spectral data was pre-processed by single and multiple transformations to study the effect of spectral preprocessing methods on the quantitative evaluation of soil moisture. The successive projections algorithm (SPA) was used to extract the corresponding wavelengths of soil moisture and the spectral monitoring model was established by using the partial least squares (PLS). The results show that (1) SMC and spectral reflectance show an obvious negative correlation, and the spectral reflectance gradually decreases with the increase of SMC. (2) Appropriate pretreatment methods can improve the correlation between SMC and spectral reflectance and improve the accuracy of the SMC monitoring model, of which T19 (R-2 + SNV + FD) is the best spectral pretreatment method.

This study evaluated the risk of soil P release in three representative systems of paddy fields in China (rice fields (RF), integrated crayfish-rice fields (CRF), and crayfish fields (CF)) using indoor adsorption and desorption experiments and the diffusive gradient in thin films (DGT) technique, and compared the obtained results. The soils of RF and CRF showed higher levels of redox potential (Eh), free Fe-Al oxides (DCB-Fe, DCB-Al), and amorphous Fe-Al oxides (Ox-Fe, Ox-Al) compared to CF. Additionally, the soils of CRF and CF exhibited higher total organic carbon (TOC) content. The indoor experiments revealed a positive correlation between the contents of Ox-Fe, Ox-Al, bioavailable P (BAP), clay, and soil P adsorption characteristics. Desorption characteristics were primarily influenced by total P, TOC, and Ox-Fe content. Furthermore, the order of soil P release risk followed CRF {\textgreater} RF {\textgreater} CF. According to the in situ DGT measurements, the soil P release fluxes were 0.266 mg \& sdot; m(-2)\& sdot; d(-1) for CRF, 0.548 mg \& sdot;m(-2)\& sdot;d(-1) for RF, and 0.583 mg \& sdot; m(-2)\& sdot; d(-1) for CF. Accordingly, the risk of soil P release followed the order CRF {\textless} RF {\textless} CF. The contrasting results from these two methods are attributable to the indoor experiments indicating the potential for soil P adsorption under specific experimental conditions and the in situ DGT reflecting natural soil P release in a more effective and suitable manner for evaluating soil P release. The findings improve our understanding of the risk of soil P loss in CRF and provides valuable insights into the two methods.},

	abstract = {Accurate and near real-time volumetric soil water and volumetric ion content (VIC) measurements can both inform precise irrigation scheduling and aid in fertilizer management applications in cropping systems. To assist in the monitoring of these measurements, capacitance-based soil moisture probes are used in agricultural best management practice (BMP) programs. However, the ability of these sensors to detect nutrients in the soil sourced from fertilizers is not well understood. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of a capacitance-based soil moisture probe in detecting Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium (K) movement in the soil. To achieve this, a laboratory-based setup was established using pure sand soil cores. Raw soil moisture and VIC probe readings from the cores were contrasted across multiple N, P, and K rates. The N treatments applied were rates of 0, 112, 168, and 224 kg/ha; for P, were 0, 3.76, and 37.6 kg/ha, and for K were 0, 1.02, 1.53, and 2.04 kg/ha. Each nutrient was evaluated separately using a randomized complete block design experiment with three replications for N and K, and 5 replications for P. The impact of each nutrient rate on the sensitivity of VIC readings was determined by evaluating differences in three points of the time series, including the observed maximum point, inflection point, and convergence value as well as the time of occurrence of those points over a 24-hour period. These points were assessed at depths 5, 15, 25, 35, 45, and 55 cm. The findings of this study highlight the capacitance-based soil moisture probes' responsiveness to changes in all K rates at most depths. However, its sensitivity to changes in N and P rates is comparatively lower. The results obtained in this study can be used to develop fertilizer management protocols that utilize K movement as the baseline to indirectly assess N and P, while helping to inform those who currently use the probe which nutrients the probe may be detecting. The probes' readings could be incorporated into decision support systems for irrigation and nutrient management and improve control systems for precision water and nutrient management.},

We evaluate the performance of a deep learning algorithm in predicting soil VWC using various combinations of the received signal strength (RSSI) from each buried wireless node, above-ground pathloss, the distance between wireless node and receive antenna (D), ST, air temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH), and precipitation as input parameters to the model. The AT, RH, and precipitation were obtained from a nearby weather station. We find that a model with RSSI, D, AT, ST, and RH as inputs was able to predict soil VWC with an R-2 of 0.82 for test datasets, with a Root Mean Square Error of +/- 0.012 (m(3)/m(3)). Hence, a combination of deep learning and other easily available soil and climatic parameters can be a viable candidate for replacing expensive soil VWC sensors in WUSNs.},

South Odisha was affected by Cyclonic Storm Daye in September 2018 and Cyclonic Storm Titli was occurred in August affecting Andhra Pradesh and Odisha as well. The Eastern portion of India was affected by the Cyclonic Storm Fani in April 2019. In May 2020, West Bengal was affected by the Amphan which is a Super Cyclonic Storm and in the same year Tamil Nadu was affected by the very severe Cyclonic Storm Nivar in November 2020. These are just a few of the notable cyclonic events in the Indian Sub-Continent. These cyclonic events cause a dramatic change in a very short time from dry soil to exceptional flooding. In this proposed work, we are attempting to create an observations-driven prediction model to quantify the soil moisture variations daily, predict county-based meteorology and evaluate the cause of cyclones and heavy rainfall in certain areas of India. In our work, we applied a deep learning-based methodology to predict soil moisture. For the prediction model, we fused Feed Forward Neural Networks with the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) model and present the prediction results. We have used climatic as well as environmental data published by the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) Warning from 2011. The collected data is time-series data. Comparisons and the relationship that exists between soil moisture and meteorological data are made and analyzed. The soil moisture of the South Indian states Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu are predicted from weather data using a hybrid deep learning model. The evaluations of the proposed work using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared (R-2) against Non-hybrid Neural Network models such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks, and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models is analyzes where our model has given better results.},

	abstract = {High-quality gridded soil moisture products are essential for many Earth system science applications, while the recent reanalysis and remote sensing soil moisture data are often available at coarse resolution and remote sensing data are only for the surface soil. Here, we present a 1 km resolution long-term dataset of soil moisture derived through machine learning trained by the in situ measurements of 1789 stations over China, named SMCI1.0 (Soil Moisture of China by in situ data, version 1.0). Random forest is used as a robust machine learning approach to predict soil moisture using ERA5-Land time series, leaf area index, land cover type, topography and soil properties as predictors. SMCI1.0 provides 10-layer soil moisture with 10 cm intervals up to 100 cm deep at daily resolution over the period 2000-2020. Using in situ soil moisture as the benchmark, two independent experiments were conducted to evaluate the estimation accuracy of SMCI1.0: year-to-year (ubRMSE ranges from 0.041 to 0.052 and R ranges from 0.883 to 0.919) and station-to-station experiments (ubRMSE ranges from 0.045 to 0.051 and R ranges from 0.866 to 0.893). SMCI1.0 generally has advantages over other gridded soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, SMAP-L4, and SoMo.ml. However, the high errors of soil moisture are often located in the North China Monsoon Region. Overall, the highly accurate estimations of both the year-to-year and station-to-station experiments ensure the applicability of SMCI1.0 to study the spatial-temporal patterns. As SMCI1.0 is based on in situ data, it can be a useful complement to existing model-based and satellite-based soil moisture datasets for various hydrological, meteorological, and ecological analyses and models.

	abstract = {Soil volumetric water content (theta) is a parameter describing one of the most important factors conditioning proper plant growth. Monitoring soil moisture is of particular importance in the rational use of water resources for irrigation, especially during periods of water scarcity. This paper presents a method of measuring soil moisture in the vicinity of the plant root system by means of a probe designed to be mounted on a mobile device used for precise plant irrigation. Due to the specific field conditions of the measurement, the design of the probe was proposed as a monopole antenna. Electromagnetic simulations of the probe were carried out with Ansys HFSS software to optimise its dimensions. Then a prototype of the probe was manufactured to conduct laboratory measurements with the use of a vector network analyser (VNA) working in the 20 kHz to 8 GHz frequency range. The VNA analyser was configured to work in the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) mode. From measurements of the time distance between reflections from the probe's elements it is possible to calculate the bulk dielectric permittivity of the soil surrounding the probe. Next, based on commonly used soil moisture dielectric calibrations one can determine theta of the soil sample. The paper presents simulation results and laboratory tests of an antenna probe. Due to its tough and durable design, this type of probe gives the possibility of easy application in field conditions, which makes it especially suitable for mechanically demanding measurement systems. As the sensitivity zone is comparatively large, this probe is well-suited to measuring soil moisture in the vicinity of the plant root system.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor technology advancements have made soil moisture wireless sensor networks (SMWSNs) a vital component of precision agriculture. However, the humidity nodes in SMWSNs have a weak ability in information collection, storage, calculation, etc. Hence, it is essential to reasonably pursue task allocation for SMWSNs to improve the network benefits of SMWSNs. However, the task allocation of SMWSNs is an NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial)-hard issue, and its complexity becomes even higher when constraints such as limited computing capabilities and power are taken into consideration. In this paper, a novel differential evolution adaptive elite butterfly optimization algorithm (DEAEBOA) is proposed. DEAEBOA has significantly improved the task allocation efficiency of SMWSNs, effectively avoided plan stagnation, and greatly accelerated the convergence speed. In the meantime, a new adaptive operator was designed, which signally ameliorates the accuracy and performance of the algorithm. In addition, a new elite operator and differential evolution strategy are put forward to markedly enhance the global search ability, which can availably avoid local optimization. Simulation experiments were carried out by comparing DEAEBOA with the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithm (GA), and beluga whale optimization (BWO). The simulation results show that DEAEBOA significantly improved the task allocation efficiency, and compared with BOA, PSO, GA, and BWO the network benefit rate increased by 11.86\%, 5.46\%, 8.98\%, and 12.18\% respectively.},

	abstract = {Soil water content is an important indicator used to maintain the ecological balance of farmland. The efficient spatial prediction of soil water content is crucial for ensuring crop growth and food production. To this end, 104 farmland soil samples were collected in the Yellow River Delta (YRD) in China, and the soil water content was determined using the drying method. A gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) model based on a tree-structured Parzen estimator (TPE) hyperparametric optimization was developed, and then the soil water content was predicted and mapped based on the soil texture and vegetation index from Sentinel-2 remote sensing images. The results of statistical analysis showed that the soil water content had a high coefficient of variation (55.30\%), a non-normal distribution, and complex spatial variability. Compared with other models, the TPE-GBDT model had the highest prediction accuracy (RMSE = 6.02\% and R-2 = 0.71), and its mapping results showed that the areas with high soil water content were distributed on both sides of the river and near the estuary. Furthermore, the results of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis showed that the soil texture (PC2 and PC5), modified normalized difference vegetation index (MNDVI), and Sentinel-2 red edge position (S2REP) index provided important contributions to the spatial prediction of soil water content. We found that the hydraulic physical properties of soil texture and the vegetation characteristics (such as vegetation coverage, root action, and transpiration) are the key factors affecting the spatial migration and heterogeneity of the soil water content in the study area. The above results show that the TPE algorithm can quickly capture the hyperparameters that are most suitable for the GBDT model, so that the GBDT model can ensure prediction accuracy, reduce the loss function with less training data, and accurately learn of the nonlinear relationship between soil water content and environmental factors. This paper proposes a machine learning method for hyperparameter optimization that shows considerable potential to predict the spatial heterogeneity of soil water content, which can effectively support regional farmland soil and water conservation and high-quality agricultural development.},

Long-term and large-scale RS SM datasets derived from various microwave sensors have been used in environmental fields. Understanding the accuracies of RS SM products is essential for their proper applications. However, due to the mismatched spatial scale between the ground-based and RS observations, the truth at the pixel scale may not be accurately represented by ground-based observations, especially when the spatial density of in situ measurements is low. Because ground-based observations are often sparsely distributed, temporal upscaling was adopted to transform a few in situ measurements into SM values at a pixel scale of 1 km by introducing the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) related to SM. The upscaled SM showed high consistency with in situ SM observations and could accurately capture rainfall events. The upscaled SM was considered as the reference data to evaluate RS SM products at different spatial scales. In regard to the validation results, in addition to the correlation coefficient (R) of the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM being slightly lower than that of the Climate Change Initiative (CCI) SM, SMAP had the best performance in terms of the root-mean-square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE and bias, followed by the CCI. The Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) products were in worse agreement with the upscaled SM and were inferior to the R value of the X-band SM of the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2). In conclusion, in the study area, the SMAP and CCI SM are more reliable, although both products were underestimated by 0.060 cm(3) cm(-3) and 0.077 cm(3) cm(-3,) respectively. If the biases are corrected, then the improved SMAP with an RMSE of 0.043 cm(3) cm(-3) and the CCI with an RMSE of 0.039 cm(3) cm(-3) will hopefully reach the application requirement for an accuracy with an RMSE less than 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3).},

	abstract = {The agricultural pastoral ecotone (APE) in Northwest China is an ecological transition zone in the arid area with a very fragile ecosystem. In recent years, the ecosystem has deteriorated sharply, and increasing desertification has made the regional ecosystem more vulnerable and sensitive. In this study, we analyzed (using classical statistical methods) spatial and temporal variations in soil water content (SWC) from 14 September 2016 to 22 April 2019 for high and low vegetation in two grassland sites in Yanchi County, Ningxia. The results showed that the largest average seasonal SWC occurred in autumn. The SWC of the first three layers (0 divided by 15 cm) of the soil profile responded strongly to precipitation, whereas the SWC in deeper soil (30 divided by 50 cm) could only be recharged markedly after continuous precipitation. Additionally, the growing process of plants proved to be a cause of variability in soil moisture profiles. Vegetation degradation sped up the course of desertification and decreased soil organic carbon content. These changes left the soil increasingly desiccated and enhanced soil variability. Meanwhile, vegetation degradation also prompted changes in soil temperature and shortened the soil's frozen time in winter. With the acceleration of global warming, if the process of vegetation degeneration continues and soil temperatures keep rising, the ecosystem is likely to undergo irreversible degradation.},

In this study, Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth observation science soil moisture product was assimilated into Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model using Kalman filter data assimilation technique. Further, the updated multilayer spatio-temporal soil moisture distributions across the Mahanadi Basin, India, were simulated using the hydrological model. The VIC model was set up and parameterized using field-observed and remote sensing-derived data. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the model, the `four-parameter' (Tmax, Tmin, Prec, and WS) meteorological forcing scenario was selected as the operational scenario. The output fluxes obtained from VIC were routed to simulate discharge at five stations for the calibration and validation of the model. With R-2 and model efficiency values close to 0.95 and 0.99, respectively, the model was proven to be suitable for simulating the hydrological responses of the basin. Soil moisture was assimilated in the top soil layer of the model using the Kalman filter approach, and the multilayer soil moisture regime was generated using the modelling approach. The validation of soil moisture (assimilated) products proves that these products are better than remote sensing and traditionally modelled soil moisture products, in both spatial and temporal domains in terms of availability and accuracy.},

Grid sampling strategy was adopted to collect soil and crop data from two potato fields in Prince Edward Island (PEI). DUALEM-2 sensor, Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR-300), GreenSeeker were used to collect soil ground conductivity parameter horizontal coplanar geometry (HCP), soil moisture content (theta), and normalized difference vegetative index (NDVI), respectively. Soil organic matter (SOM), soil pH, phosphorous (P), potash (K), iron (Fe), lime index (LI), and cation exchange capacity (CEC) were determined from soil samples collected from each grid. Stepwise regression shortlisted the major properties of soil and crop that explained 71 to 86\% of within-field variability. The cluster analysis grouped the soil and crop data into three zones, termed as excellent, medium, and poor at a 40\% similarity level. The coefficient of variation and the interpolated maps characterized least to moderate variability of soil fertility parameters, except for HCP and K that were highly variable. The results of multiple means comparison indicated that the tuber yield and HCP were significantly different in all MZs. The significant relationship between HCP and yield suggested that the ground conductivity data could be used to develop MZs for site-specific fertilization in potato fields similar to those used in this study.},

Moreover, the coarse resolution of soil moisture products generated by existing methods, which fuse SAR and passive microwave products, cannot fully satisfy the requirement of specific regional applications. To solve this problem, an SAR-optical data fusion method for soil moisture estimation (SOFSME) based on a cascade neural network is proposed in this study. SOFSME obtains surface parameters from historical soil moisture images and related environmental images to estimate a SSM image with high resolution at large scale from Sentinel-1A C-band SAR data. Validation experiments in single and multiple land-use type areas showed that the SOFSME performed best on bare soil areas with a median root mean square error of 0.0203. The median universal image quality index of estimated soil moisture image was 0.1454, which was better for single cropland areas than multi-land-use type areas. The Pearson correlation coefficient showed a median value of 0.7645 in both experiments. These results showed that the SOFSME had high accuracy, availability, and stability in regional soil moisture estimation. Compared with existing methods, the SOFSME can provide high-quality soil moisture images and does not directly depend on field measurement data. Thus, the proposed SOFSME method is of great value for high-resolution soil moisture estimation in more regional applications. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE)},

This study represents the first attempt connecting cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) with soil erosion research, a novel approach to explore the complex relationships between soil water content (SWC) and soil redistribution processes using two of the most powerful nuclear techniques, CRNS and fallout 137Cs. Our preliminary results indicate that CRNS captured soil moisture dynamics along the study toposequence and demonstrated the sensitivity of neutron sensors to investigate the effect of parent material on soil water content. The Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the comprehensive data from seven CRNS surveys revealed that one dominant spatial structure (EOF1) explains 89.2\% of SMSV. The soil redistribution rates estimated with 137Cs at the nine locations along the hillslope, together with local factors related to soil properties (SOC, soil depth, hydraulic conductivity) and land use showed significant correlations with EOF. This study provides strong field evidence that soil type significantly affect SMSV, highlighting the key impact on soil erosion and sedimentation rates. Nevertheless, more research is needed to investigate the specific contributions of soil properties to the spatial variability of soil moisture and their subsequent effects on soil redistribution dynamics of interest for soil management.},

	abstract = {Water managers need improved seasonal streamflow forecasts in drought-prone regions like the U.S. Great Plains, where the inter-annual variability in rainfall and streamflow is high and seasonal streamflow forecasting systems are not well developed. Recent research has demonstrated that in-situ soil moisture measurements can be used to produce accurate streamflow forecasts in the Great Plains where rainfall runoff is the predominant source of streamflow. However, an inadequate density of in-situ soil moisture monitoring locations makes producing such forecasts impossible in many locations. Therefore, our objective was to develop and quantify the accuracy of seasonal streamflow forecasts for rainfall-dominated watersheds using remotely sensed data. Precipitation and remotely sensed soil moisture and terrestrial water storage anomaly data were incorporated into a multiple linear regression (MLR) model to produce seasonal streamflow forecasts for five watersheds in the Great Plains. The best MLR models had Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values ranging from 0.71 to 0.93, indicating good to very good model performance. In one watershed with nearby in-situ soil moisture data, the use of remotely sensed soil moisture data led to greater forecast accuracy than did the inclusion of the sparse in-situ data. Our results show that the use of remote sensing data in MLR models can provide accurate seasonal streamflow forecasts in rainfalldominated regions which currently lack such information.},

	abstract = {High-resolution spatial-temporal root zone soil moisture (RZSM) information collected at different scales is useful for a variety of agricultural, hydrologic, and climate applications. RZSM can be estimated using remote sensing, empirical equations, or process-based simulation models. Machine learning (ML) approaches for evaluating RZSM across numerous spatial-temporal scales are less generalizable than process-based models. However, data-driven ML approaches offer a unique opportunity to develop complex models of soil moisture without making assumptions about the processes governing soil water dynamics in a given study region. In this study, comparisons were made between two models, pySEBAL and EFSOIL, which were based on evaporation fraction (EF) and soil properties, and a data-driven model based on the Random Forest (RF) ensemble algorithm. These approaches were evaluated to demonstrate their capabilities for RZSM estimation. The EF obtained from Landsat images was used after validation with eddy covariance measurements as the major input to all three models, along with other meteorological and soil physical properties. The RF model was trained using in situ soil moisture data from Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensors installed in a vineyard from 2018 to 2020. The predictor variables comprised of meteorological, soil properties, EF, and a vegetation index. The results reveal that there was a strong correlation between the in situ measured soil moisture and the RF predicted soil moisture at all sensor locations. Due to the complexity of the physical processes involved in soil water flow, the empirical models pySEBAL and EFSOIL were unable to reliably predict RZSM values at all monitored locations. The high RZSM predicted by pySEBAL demonstrated the presence of possible bias in the model's algorithm used to estimate soil moisture. We also demonstrated that ML based on the RF algorithm may be used to predict spatially distributed RZSM when a few soil moisture ground measurements are combined with remote sensing to produce soil moisture maps.},

The IR function parameters provide valuable information on water system characteristics, such as the total response and the response times of soil moisture to precipitation and evapotranspiration.

Soil fertilization may affect both plant quality and indirect defenses, as well as the prey quality of herbivores for predators. The soil fertility hypothesis (SFH) claims that gall-inducing insects infest more plants growing on poor than on fertile soils. Until now this was studied and supported only by observations in natural tropical biomes. We tested its validity in a field experiment in a Mediterranean region, using four aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Eriosomatinae) that induce galls in wild Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) trees, and their main enemies. The impact of fertilization was examined in control trees that were not fertilized ('poor soil') and others that were fertilized with NPK for either one or two consecutive growing seasons. Average internode length in apical shoots of fertilized trees was longer than in control trees, following SFH expectations. We did not detect a different number of aphid species in each tree, contrary to SFH predictions. Fertilization lowered the number of galls, the gall survival, and the mean number of aphids inside the galls, as expected by the SFH. All the galls suffered increased attacks by enemies in fertilized trees, as expected by the SFH. In conclusion, following this field experiment, the SFH should not be rejected as a possible framework in research on galling-insect ecology.},

	abstract = {An accurate regional estimate of soil moisture content (SMC) is important for water management and drought monitoring. Traditional ground measurement methods of SMC are limited by the disadvantages of high cost and small scale. The development of remote sensing (RS) technology provides a cost-effective tool for estimating SMC at regional scale. However, the estimation of SMC by using the combination of multiple sensors has yet to be thoroughly discussed. Furthermore, the way in which vegetation types, fraction of vegetation coverage (FVC) and soil layer depth affect the SMC-estimation performance remains unclear. Therefore, the objectives in this study are to (1) evaluate the SMC-estimation performance provided by Landsat-8 data and random forest regression (RFR) algorithm; (2) discuss the accuracy of RS-based method for SMC estimation at different soil layer depths, and (3) explore how vegetation types and FVC affect the performance of SMC-estimation. The results can be summarized as: (1) the SMC estimation performance of multispectral (MS)- and thermal infrared (TIR)-based indices single used were comparable, in which TIR-based indices performed better in shallow soil layer while MS-based indices performed better in deep soil layer. Generally, MS- and TIR-based indices jointly used outperformed the index single used. (2) the accuracy of the proposed method for estimating SMC decreased with soil depth. (3) the proposed method performed greatest in grassland with relatively low height among the three vegetation types. Moreover, the SMC estimation in moderate vegetation coverage (FVC ranged from 0.3 to 0.5) was best. These results indicate that RS-based multimodal data combined with RFR could provide relatively repeatable and accurate SMC estimation. This approach can thus be used for the regional SMC monitoring and water resources management.},

Field experiment was conducted in the more and less fertile soil with two treatments. Results showed that compared with conventional management system, integrated soil-cotton management system increased 9.5-21.2\% soil-available nitrogen during the middle and later growth stages, in addition, improved average and maximum accumulation rate of nitrogen by 30.4-36.2\% and 39.9-45.1\%, and postponed the start time of the fast nitrogen accumulation phase by 3-6d, resulting in 32.5-38.3\% higher final nitrogen accumulation. Furthermore, the increased nitrogen accumulation improved leaf area index, leaf area duration and boll number, finally enhanced agronomic nitrogen use efficiency and recovery nitrogen use efficiency. We suggest the nitrogen-based fertilizer of integrated soil-cotton management system could be omitted completely in the more fertile soil to enhance physiological nitrogen use efficiency ultimately by optimizing leaf area index. In addition, the decrement of nitrogen use efficiency was diminished under integrated soil-cotton management system. These results demonstrate ISMS might be a more profitable pattern for nitrogen use efficiency of cotton, especially to meet the challenge of soil degradation in future.},

In this paper, we propose a new variant of OPTRAM that can map not only soil moisture, but also water bodies such as lakes and rivers. The proposed variant was tested using laboratory experimental data as well as Landsat-8 reflectance observations. Results showed the new OPTRAM variant has greater skill than the original variant in separating land and water pixels. In addition, the new variant showed less sensitivity to the model parameters, and hence, is less user dependent. To quantitatively examine the user-dependency of the model, we analyzed OPTRAM soil moisture based on Landsat-8 satellite images in California, where we varied the model parameters in a plausible range. The correlations of the resulting maps in terms of R2 between two largely different sets of parameters were found in the range of 0.47-0.52 for the original variant and 0.67-0.76 for the new variant. Because some OPTRAM parameters can be quite uncertain, particularly in wet regions, the reduced sensitivity promises more consistent soil moisture estimates across the range of parameter choices.},

In modern agricultural production, which is intensive and should at the same time be environmentally friendly, there is a need to monitor soil moisture, salinity and temperature. The aim of the study was to determine the demand of producers of agricultural and horticultural plants for equipment and systems for monitoring soil properties at an individual farm level in regions with highly developed agriculture. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 1087 respondents, also direct interviews in Poland were undertaken. According to the producers' responses, it is important to know soil moisture, salinity and temperature, although currently only about 4\% of the surveyed farmers have the equipment to evaluate these soil parameters. In their view cost is not the most important obstacle to the purchase of the necessary probes. More important is that the devices should be easy to install and use, and have an easy to use application for data collection, processing and transfer. The current market does not offer solutions that meet these producers expectations. The demand for suitable probes is very high as over 80\% of the farmers declared their willingness to purchase such probes. Technical problems related to the operation and servicing of such equipment were the most frequently mentioned impediments in their use. However, farmers and horticulturists believe that knowledge of their soil properties would allow them to optimize the elements of cultivation technology, including the use of plant irrigation systems, the use of mineral fertilizers and plant protection products.},

We monitored the biogeochemical cycle of major elements in 11 representative mature stands throughout France over the 2013 to 2020 period to better understand repercussions on soil processes. Methods The present study is focused on throughfall and soil solution chemistry: concentrations were measured monthly at 15 cm and 60 cm depth and fluxes of major anions and cations were computed. Results Our results show that nitrate strongly dominated the soil solution chemistry: concentrations were elevated ({\textgreater}20 mg L-1) for 8 out of 11 sites with mean annual NO3- values ranging from 2 to 253 mg L-1. Fluxes of nitrate at 60 cm of depth, ranging from 23 to 309 kg ha(-1) yr(-1), were much higher than those in throughfall for nine studied sites. Nitrate, which was the dominant anion in soil solution, associated either to Ca2+, Mg2+ and K+, or to Al3+ was lost out of the soil-plant system through leaching. Conclusions These results suggest a production of NO3- in the soil exceeding tree uptake and microbial immobilization resulting in strong ongoing soil acidification at many sites and potential degradation of water quality. Significant negative correlations were found between nitrate concentration in soil solution and sandy texture, soil C and N, site elevation and, annual rainfall, but further research is necessary to clarify the role of these factors in reducing the negative impacts on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems.},

However, the parameterization of the dry edge in the TVDI model is performed with a constraint to define the maximum water stress conditions. Mismatch of the spatial scale between visible and thermal bands retrieved from remotely sensed data and terrain variations also affect the effectiveness of the TVDI. Therefore, this study proposed a new drought index named the condition vegetation drought index (CVDI) to monitor the temporal and spatial variations of soil moisture status by substituting the land surface temperature (LST) with the modified perpendicular drought index (MPDI). In situ soil moisture observations at crop and pasture sites in Victoria were used to validate the effectiveness of the CVDI. The results indicate that the dry and wet edges in the parameterization scheme of the CVDI formed a better-defined trapezoid shape than that of the TVDI. Compared with the MPDI and TVDI for soil moisture monitoring at crop sites, the CVDI exhibited a performance superior to the MPDI and TVDI in most days where the coefficients of determination (R-2) achieved can reach to 0.67 on DOY023, 137, 274 and 0.71 on DOY 322 and reproduced more accurate spatial and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Moreover, the CVDI showed higher correlation with the Australian Water Resource Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L) soil moisture product on temporal scales. The R-2 can reach to 0.69 and the root mean square error (RMSE) is also much better than that of the MPDI and TVDI. Overall, it can be concluded that the CVDI appears to be a feasible method and can be successfully used in regional soil moisture monitoring.},

We evaluate how well drought indices and the modeled soil moisture represent the intensity, variability, and persistence of the observed soil moisture in the southern Great Plains. We also apply the drought indices to evaluate land-atmosphere interactions and compare the results with soil moisture. The results show that the SPI, SPEI, and Z index have higher correlations with 0-10-cm soil moisture, while the CMI is more strongly correlated with 0-100-cm soil moisture. All the drought indices tend to overestimate the area affected by moderate to extreme drought conditions. Significant drying trends from 2003 to 2017 are evident in SPEI, Z index, and CMI, and they agree with those in the observed soil moisture. The CMI captures the intra- and interannual variability of 0-100-cm soil moisture better than the other drought indices. The persistence of CMI is longer than that of 0-10-cm soil moisture and shorter than that of 0-100-cm soil moisture. Model-derived soil moisture does not outperform the CMI in the 0-100-cm soil layer. The Z index and CMI are better drought indices to use as a proxy for soil moisture when examining land-atmosphere interactions while the SPI is not recommended.

At a site in the Edwards Plateau, Texas, we developed a protocol for installing sensors in limestone pits and tested its effectiveness in reducing erroneous readings caused by installation-induced preferential flow along pit walls. Our results show that rock moisture can be accurately measured with EC-5 sensors, provided some steps are taken to ensure the quality of the installation. These include protecting the sensors by installing them in horizontal shafts rather than on the exposed pit wall, and use of a sealant. Data gathered over 7 mo after installation showed that rock moisture increased significantly only after a 95-mm rainfall event. Because of preferential flow, fractures reached peak water content within 2-3 h after peak rainfall-a response that was one to two orders of magnitude faster than in rock matrix. Limestone stored 40-70\% of the water after the 95-mm event, and its water content decreased significantly during summer months. Overall, our results attest to the importance of continuously measuring rock moisture in regions with shallow soils, where it serves as a critical reservoir for vegetation.},

While the topsoil dries out significantly from summer to autumn down to a depth of about 3 m, a clear increase in soil water content and a decrease in resistivity below 3 m can be observed during winter period. Anomalies in the topsoil (0-1 m) showing lower resistivities than the surrounding substrate could be related to tree positions by additional terrestrial laser scans. A significant relationship could be found between tree crown projection area and resistivity in 1-2 m depth. We found a trend that mean resistivity below pine is lower as below beech. ERT data were also used to estimate the soil water content via Archie's law and the results correlate strongly with the measured values, but the degree of correlation varies depending on the depth level. ERT as a noninvasive method, in combination with additional data, for example, on the vitality status of individual trees, could help to better understand root water uptake and water supply to trees, especially during periods of drought.},

Thus, monitoring agricultural drought requires not only knowledge of rainfall anomaly but also quantification of soil moisture. In this study, the effects of various methods of quantifying the green vegetation fraction green vegetation fraction (GVF) on the land-surface-model (LSM)-based soil moisture drought index (SMDI) were assessed using the harvest area data of the World Meteorological Organization together with the widely used vegetation health index and drought severity index. GVF data used in this study include monthly climatological GVF, weekly advanced very high-resolution radiometer (AVHRR)-normalized difference vegetation index-based and 8-daily moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) leaf area index (LAI)-based GVF. The results show that SMDI is optimized when using the near-real-time GVF and that LAI-based GVF increases the accuracy of SMDI when monitoring early agricultural drought. The study shows that we can be confident in the accuracy of signals of emerging drought, particularly during the rapid onset of drought.},

In this article, using mutual information (MI) theory, we investigate the efficacy of the downscaled SMAP/Sentinel-1 L2 3-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL2) for the detection of agricultural drought over northwestern China. The SPL2 is generated by merging SMAP enhanced radiometer data with Sentinel-1 radar observations. To evaluate the efficiency of the SPL2 downscaled algorithm, the SMAP Enhanced L3 Radiometer 9-km EASE-Grid SM product (SPL3) is also utilized as a non-downscaled baseline. Over croplands, comparing normalized MI (NMI) values sampled between the NDVI time series and 3-km Sentinel-1 C-band backscatter coefficient (sigma) from SPL2 with NMI values between NDVI and SPL3 radiometer brightness temperature (Tb; resampled to 3-km resolution), we find that the Sentinel-1 sigma explains more (3-km) NDVI information than the SPL3 Tb, as the NMI between sigma(vh) (sigma(vv)) and NDVI is 15\% (8\%), larger than that between SPL3 Tb and NDVI (5\%). However, compared to the SPL3 Tb baseline, the information from downscaled SPL2 Tb on NDVI is reduced by approximately 3\%, and the SPL2 algorithm extracts only 7\% (10\%) of the total information available from both enhanced SPL3 Tb and Sentinel-1 sigma(vh) (sigma(vv)). Overall, the C-band sigma signal provides valuable information for vegetation monitoring due to its frequency advantage. However, additional efforts should be focused on SPL2 merging algorithms to improve the value of the downscaled SPL2 product for agricultural applications.},

	abstract = {Drought can cause severe agricultural economic losses and hinder social and economic development. To manage drought, the process of drought events needs to be described with the help of an effective drought indicator. As a comprehensive variable, soil moisture is an essential indicator for describing agricultural drought. In this work, the extreme drought events in southwest China were analysed by the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) root zone soil moisture data set. To define the drought quantitatively, a Standardized Soil Moisture Drought Index (SSMI) was calculated using the soil moisture data, then used to get the duration, frequency, and severity of drought events in southwest China. The results showed that the frequency and intensity of drought in southwest China had an apparent upward trend before 2014 and an apparent downward trend since 2014. Moreover, there are apparent differences in the frequency and intensity of drought in various regions of southwest China. Yunnan Province is prone to spring drought events. Guangxi Province and Guizhou Province are prone to spring, autumn and winter droughts, and the intensity of autumn and winter droughts is significantly higher than that of spring droughts. The Sichuan-Chongqing border area is prone to summer drought. We found that the monthly variation of soil moisture in different provinces in southwest China is consistent, but the seasonal variation of drought is different. Meanwhile, the performance of the SSMI was compared to the commonly used drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The results showed that the SSMI is more sensitive to drought than both SPEI and PDSI in southwest China. The results also demonstrate that GLDAS soil moisture data can be used to study drought at a small regional scale.},

Effective maintenance of green infrastructure requires optimal irrigation of plant root systems during the prolonged drying period. Based on the measurement of soil moisture, various drip irrigation systems have been developed. Surface irrigation, however, has the disadvantage of loss of soil moisture through evaporation. In addition, the growth of plants is mainly dependent on subsurface soil moisture, especially within the root zones. Therefore, there is a need to develop an automatic system regulating soil moisture at different depths. In this study, an Arduino-based irrigation control system was developed to regulate the volumetric water contents of soil within a certain depth range. A one-dimensional soil column test was conducted to demonstrate its performance. The test results show that the system enabled the regulation of soil water content within the specified range (12-20\%) with an error of 2\%. The error was further minimized by recalibrating the upper limit of the system. This study provides an improved green infrastructure irrigation system to control the moisture distribution within the soil subsurface.},

However, a spatially continuous assessment of RS SM datasets is impeded by the limited spatial distribution of ground-based observations. As an alternative, the RS apparent thermal inertia (ATI) data related to the SM are transformed into SM values to expand the validation space. To obtain error components, the ATI-based SM along with the Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission (SMAP) and Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) SM are applied with the triple-collocation (TC) method to evaluate the RS SM data regarding random errors and amplitude variances at the regional scale. When the ATI-based SM is regarded as the reference data, the amplitude biases of the other two datasets are determined. The mean bias is also estimated by calculating the mean value difference between the ATI-based and validated RS SM. The results show that the ATI-based SM is a reliable source of reference data that, when combined with the TC method, can correctly estimate the error structure of RS SM datasets in wide space, promoting the reasonable application and calibration of RS SM datasets.},

Net N mineralization was determined by measuring NH4+-N and NO3–N contents periodically over 84 days. Significant main effects of temperature and moisture were found (p {\textless} .0001) and tendencies of a significance of alfalfa amendment (p = .0855) and interaction between amendment and temperature (p = .0842) were observed. Only a significant increase of the net mineralized N at 30oC in amended soil was observed compared to unamended soil (p = .0043). Estimated from the first-order exponential model, maximum potential mineralized N was 1.2 times greater while mineralization rate was up to 2.1 times greater in amended soil compare to un-amended soil. Q(10) estimated from the Arrhenius model ranged from 1.62 to 2.04 in the amended soil and 1.66 to1.85 in the un-amended soil. The average optimal soil water content for maximum N mineralization estimated from the Gaussian function model was 33.8\% in amended soil and 35.9\% in un-amended soil.

	abstract = {The global navigation satellite system (GNSS) refraction pattern technique makes use of two pairs of GNSS receivers and antennas to collect the refracted signal in the medium and the direct signal in the air, respectively. Due to the sensitive response of the refracted signal to variation of the dielectric constant, the technique is suitable for measuring medium dielectric constant-related parameters such as snowpack density, vegetation water content, and soil moisture. In this article, a forward model related to the power ratio of the refracted signal to the direct one is developed to elucidate the mechanism of soil moisture-induced refracted signal strength attenuation. By making use of the simulating results derived from the model, a second-order polynomial function is established to describe the relationship between the power ratio, soil temperature, and soil moisture. Based on the function, an inversion algorithm, which takes the GNSS carrier-to-noise (C/N-0) observations under high elevation angles (50 degrees-60 degrees) and soil temperature as the inputs, is proposed for the near-surface soil moisture estimation. The proposed algorithm is validated through a dataset collected in an experimental campaign over two years. The results demonstrate that there exists a good agreement between the proposed method-derived soil moisture estimations and ground-truth ones; and the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the proposed algorithm-derived soil moisture estimation is 0.009 cm(3) cm(-3) when the ground-truth soil moisture is in the range from 0.150 to 0.550 cm(3) cm(-3). Because the observations were collected by using consumer-grade GNSS chips and antennas, this study also provides a basis for the design and development of the low-cost GNSS soil moisture sensor in the future.},

	abstract = {Maize (Zea mays L.) production in north western Ethiopia is severely constrained by the parasitic weed striga (Striga hermontica), the stemborer (Busseola fusca) pest, and poor soil fertility due to continuous mono cropping. An intercropping system known as push-pull technology is a novel soil and pest management strategy for improving soil fertility and controlling agricultural pests by using repellent “push” plants (such as desmodium, Desmodium intortum) and trap “pull” plants (such as napier grass, Pennisetum purpureum). The aims of the study were (i) to evaluate the effectiveness of the push-pull technology against stemborer and striga infestation, (ii) to investigate the impact of the push-pull technology on improving grain yield, and (iii) to assess effect of the pushpull technology on soil fertility. The study was conducted in 2017 and 2018 cropping seasons in 3 districts in north western Ethiopia. Three farmers from each district, who practiced the technology, were randomly selected for the study. Each farmer had a set of two treatments (plots): a push-pull technology (PPT) and maize monocrop (MC) treatments. Data were collected on the percentage of maize plants damaged by stemborers, the number of striga plants that emerged, plant height, grain yield, available phosphorus (P), available potassium (K), total nitrogen (TN), organic carbon (OC), organic matter (OM) and bulk density (BD). There were significant reduction in stemborer damage (2.8 \%) and striga count (4.1 Striga plants/m2) in the push-pull treatment compared to the maize monocrop plots (15.4 \% and 21.8 striga plants/m2, respectively). Maize plant height (2.34 m) and grain yield (5.3 t ha-1) were significantly higher in the push-pull plots as compared to the sole crop (1.9 m and 3.0 t ha-1, respectively). Similarly, there were significantly higher P (20.06 mg/kg soil), K (406.86 mg/kg soil), TN (2.5 g/kg soil), OC (42.9 g/kg soil), OM (73.8 g/kg soil) levels considered to be moderate to high fertility status in the push-pull as compared to monocrop plots (11.17 mg/kg soil, 347.93 mg/kg soil, 1.6 g/kg soil, 29.8 g/kg soil, and 51.2 g/kg soil, respectively) which is rated from low to moderate soil fertility level. Moreover, bulk density was significantly lower in PPT (0.92 g/cm3) than in MC (0.95 g/cm3) plots. This suggests that push pull technology is effective in reducing striga and stemborer damage and improves soil fertility status which results in better grain yield.},

According to this change of capacitance response, a series RLC network is designed to find out an optimum frequency for efficient sensing of moisture. The designed sensor probe is calibrated for three different types of soil (silt/sandy/clay) using Thermogravimetric (TG) Analysis. To process the sensing data, DataLogger (DL) algorithm has been developed and programmed in an ARM controller for monitoring and storing of data on server using IoT (Internet of Things). For the designed sensing circuit, an optimum frequency of 218 kHz is found out from the resonance curve. At this frequency, the response of electronic interfacing circuit is observed in terms of capacitance and voltage. Data obtained from linear analysis (R square: similar to 0.99, Pearson's r: similar to 0.99) shows that the designed sensor system responds appreciably to the moisture change.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture can be an important indicator of climate change in humid and semi-arid areas. This indicator can more efficiently propose different public policies related to climate change than just using precipitation and temperature data. Given the above, the objective of this study is to evaluate changes in soil moisture in the state of Pernambuco during the period 1961-2021, using the System of Hydrological Response Units for Pernambuco. In this study, two river basins in the state of Pernambuco that represent the different climatic conditions of the state were chosen. The results show that in the coastal region there is a tendency towards more saturated soils, and in the semi-arid region there is a tendency towards drier soils. With these results, it is possible to conclude that public policy decisions for the economy, environment, and society must consider this vital water balance variable. Leveraging soil moisture and precipitation data makes it possible to differentiate between flood risks and landslide vulnerabilities, particularly in regions characterized by higher levels of rainfall. Monitoring soil water content in humid and semi-arid areas can significantly enhance early warning systems, thereby preventing loss of life and minimizing the socio-economic impacts of such natural events. As such, this study provides a holistic understanding of the relationship between climatic patterns, soil moisture dynamics, and the occurrence of droughts and floods, ultimately contributing to more effective disaster preparedness and response measures in Pernambuco and similar regions.},

The temperature-corrected reference measurements were applied to the calibration of a hand-held soil moisture meter (Lutron PMS-714) for three soil texture types: medium, fine, and very fine. Linear regression models were used to calibrate the meter for each soil type, and the resulting calibration equations were validated with field data sampled from Sondu-Miriu watershed in Western Kenya. The validation produced errors (RMSE = 0.022, 0.010, 0.010 m3/m3) that are significantly better than the meter's reported factory calibration errors of +/- 0.05 m3/m3. While calibrations did not improve correlation statistics (R2 and RMSE), they did significantly reduce biases (+ 0.009, + 0.004, -0.001 m3/m3) compared to uncalibrated ones (-0.216, -0.181, -0.184 m3/m3).

	abstract = {The Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) product, which delivers spatially continuous soil moisture (SM) data with reliable accuracy, has been widely used in ecologically and hydrologically related studies. However, the active radar of SMAP failed after operation for approximate three months, leading to the loss of the original 3 km (called A3) and 9 km (called AP9) SMAP SM dataset afterwards. Since merely the 36 km SMAP dataset (called P36 in this research) is available up to now, the relatively coarse spatial resolution is difficult to meet the requirement for monitoring at the regional scale. In this paper, the 36 km SMAP SM dataset in the conterminous United States (CONUS) was downscaled to 3 km after the failure of the active radar. To reduce the great uncertainty in downscaling (i.e., a process from 36 km to 3 km directly), a stepwise strategy was proposed. Specifically, our currently published 9 km SMAP SM dataset (called VIP9, from April 2015 to December 2019) was used as input for downscaling, which was downscaled to 3 km by fusion with auxiliary data (e.g., Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)) at fine spatial resolution based on areato-point regression kriging (ATPRK). Furthermore, a random forest (RF)-based correction process was developed to enhance the quality of the downscaled SM dataset by fusing with the ground-based SM data (i.e., in-situ data). As a result, a 16-day composited SM dataset at 3 km spatial resolution was produced from 2015 to 2019, with a mean correlation coefficient (CC) and unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) in temporal (spatial) validation of 0.888 (0.912) and 0.021 (0.023), respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that the AP9 dataset (although only available in the three months) is helpful to increase the accuracy of downscaling. Moreover, the difference between satellite- and ground-based SM data can be further reduced through the correction process. The produced 3 km SMAP SM dataset has great potential to extend the defunct A3 data and support related studies. The contributions of the paper are twofold, including the development of the stepwise method for downscaling and the generation of the 3 km SMAP SM dataset in the CONUS during 2015-2019.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is an indispensable variable in drought monitoring and weather forecast. L-band is found to be the most suitable band for retrieving surface SM. Here, we evaluate two L-band passive microwave SM products Soil Moisture Active and Passive (SMAP) and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) in Inner Mongolia. The collected in-situ data from 24 measured sites and the triple collocation (TC) analysis method (using Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) Noah and the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) SM data as a reference dataset) are used to evaluate SMAP and SMOS SM products. In the validation based on in-situ SM, SMAP shows the highest correlation with the in-situ SM, followed by GLDAS and SMOS. The root mean square error (RMSE) and bias value of SMAP is the lowest. The validation results of each in-situ station show that the median correlation coefficient of ASCAT is the highest, followed by SMAP, GLDAS, and SMOS. The median RMSE and bias of SMAP are the lowest, while SMOS performs the worst among the three products. TC analysis results show that SMAP has better performance with the majority of the random errors distributed between 0.02 and 0.03 m(3)/m(3). The average random error of SMAP is small, while SMOS has relatively large random errors. Simultaneously, SMAP performs better than GLDAS and SMOS in grassland and low vegetation coverage areas. The research results and analysis of this paper are expected to provide some insights for improving the quality of SM products.},

The readings' calibration for the soil moisture sensor devices continued through two gravimetric methods. The first depended on the protocols' database, while the second was the traditional calibration method. The second method recorded the lowest analysis error compared with the first. The moderate -cost sensor WH51 showed the lowest standard error (SE), MAD, and RMSE and the highest R2 in both methods. The performance accuracy of WH51 was close to readings shown by the manufacturing company (1\%), as the MAD amounted to 1.62\%. Through both methods, the average MAD for sensors ranged from 4.76\% to 7.36\%, with this result considered acceptable, especially for low-cost sensors with insufficient available information for accuracy. In general, the average mean absolute percentage (MAPE) for all sensors was 25.54\%, which means that the validity of the measurement for the low-cost sensors reached 75\%. It encourages their use by plant breeders in irrigation, as the error rate was less than the specified depletion of 50\% for available water in irrigation, where all study textures showed that the sensor reading reached the limits of 72 (+/- 2), adopting 3\% MAD for all sensors. The study affirms that, except for the IC station sensor recommended for irrigation use only in sandy -sandy loam soils, low-cost sensors have suitable accuracy for irrigation management.},

Few studies have investigated whether such measurements can be used for calibration. In this paper, an observation-driven optimization method was proposed to estimate SM from remote sensing observations. Specifically, the optimization method was developed within the surface temperature-vegetation index (TVX) framework for the definition of objective function and constraints. In-situ SM measurements were used to optimize the theoretical boundaries of the TVX feature space. We demonstrated the applicability of the new method with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products over the Southern Great Plains (SGP) of the United States of America. Results indicate that the accuracy produced using only one site for calibration has reached a level comparable with those produced by traditional methods. Moreover, the method has not only bypassed the complex parameterization of aerodynamic and surface resistance but also achieved continuous monitoring of SM. That is just the capacity that the traditional TVX method does not possess. Therefore, although our optimization method requires the ancillary of in-situ observations, its simplicity proves that it is a useful tool for a quick and continuous monitoring of SM over large heterogeneous areas.},

Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) measure area-average soil moisture at field scale, filling a spatial scale gap betweenin-situobservations and remote sensing measurements. However, its applicability has not been assessed in the agricultural-pastoral ecotone, a data scarce semi-arid and arid region in Northwest China (APENC). In this study, we calibrated and assessed the CRNS (the standardN(0)method) estimates of soil moisture. Results show that Pearson correlation coefficient,R-P, and the root mean square error (RMSE) between the CRNS soil moisture and the gravimetric soil moisture are 0.904 and less than 0.016 m(3)m(-3), respectively, indicating that the CRNS is able to estimate the area-average soil moisture well at our study site. Compared with thein-situsensor network measurements (ECH2O sensors), the CRNS is more sensitive to the changes in moisture in its footprint, which overestimates and underestimates the soil moisture under precipitation and dry conditions, respectively. The three shape parametersa(0),a(1),a(2)in the standard calibration equation (N(0)method) are not well suited to the study area. The calibrated parameters improved the accuracy of the CRNS soil moisture estimates. Due to the lack of low gravimetric soil moisture data, performance of the calibratedN(0)function is still poor in the extremely dry conditions. Moreover, aboveground biomass including vegetation biomass, canopy interception and widely developed biological soil crusts adds to the uncertainty of the CRNS soil moisture estimates. Such biomass impacts need to be taken into consideration to further improve the accuracy of soil moisture estimation by the CRNS in the data scarce areas such as agricultural-pastoral ecotone in Northwest China.},

	abstract = {As a key component in the water and energy cycle, estimates of precipitation with high resolution and accuracy is of great significance for hydrological, meteorological, and ecological studies. However, current satellite-based precipitation products have a coarse spatial resolution (from 10 to 50 km) not meeting the needs of several applications (e.g., flash floods and landslides). The implementation of spatial downscaling methods can be a suitable approach to overcome this shortcoming. In this study, we developed a soil moisture-based precipitation downscaling (SMPD) method for spatially downscaling the integrated multisatellite retrievals for global precipitation measurement (IMERG) V06B daily precipitation product over a complex topographic and climatic area in southwestern Europe (Iberian Peninsula) in the period 2016-2018. By exploiting the soil-water balance equation, high-resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) products were used as auxiliary variables. The spatial resolution of the IMERG daily precipitation product was downscaled from 10 to 1 km. An evaluation using 1027 rain gauge stations highlighted the good performance of the downscaled 1 km IMERG product compared to the original 10 km product, with a correlation coefficient of 0.61, root mean square error (RMSE) of 4.83 mm and a relative bias of 5 \%. Meanwhile, the 1 km downscaled results can also capture the typical temporal and spatial variation behaviors of precipitation in the study area during dry and wet seasons. Overall, the SMPD method greatly improves the spatial details of the original 10 km IMERG product also with a slight enhancement of accuracy. It shows good potential to be applied for the development of high-quality and high-resolution precipitation products in any region of interest.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in drought monitoring, agricultural management, flood forecasting, and other practical applications. However, the relatively coarse spatial resolutions of SM products derived from passive microwave satellite retrievals (approximately 25-55 km) greatly hamper their local-scale applications. In this research, we proposed an SM downscaling framework based on the Wide \& Deep Learning (WDL) method to improve the spatial resolution of the level-3 daily composite of Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) radiometer SM product (L3\_SM\_P). In this method, horizontally and vertically polarized Brightness Temperature (TBh, and TBv, respectively), surface reflectance and Land Surface Temperature (LST), topographic attributes, soil properties, climate types, and landcover types collected in the Continental United States (CONUS) during the annual unfrozen season (April 1st to November 1st) from 2015 to 2017 were used as auxiliary datasets to downscale the spatial resolution of the SMAP SM (L3\_SM\_P) product from its original 36 km to 1 km. Precipitation and in-situ SM measurements obtained from 211 sites distributed across the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) over the CONUS were utilized to validate the downscaled SM. The results demonstrated that the correlation (R) between the downscaled and the in-situ SM ranged from 0.325 to 0.997; the average R value was 0.715. The unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) values ranged from 0.010 to 0.141 m3/m3, with an average ubRMSE of 0.041 m3/m3, which meets the accuracy of SMAP SM requirement of ubRMSE approximately 0.04 m 3/m3. The downscaled SM also showed good temporal consistency with the in-situ SM and exhibited a high response to the precipitation data. The downscaled SM not only maintained high spatial consistency with the original SMAP SM but also provides more detailed spatial SM variations.},

The temporal-spatial variations in SM and its relationship with precipitation (Pr) in different subregions are then explored. The magnitude of SM is relatively large in south China and is low in northwest China, and it generally increases with soil depth in each region. The maximum SM appears in spring and/or autumn and the minimum in summer, and the SM seasonality does not vary as distinctly as that of Pr. For the top three soil layers (10-, 20-, and 50-cm levels), the linear trend analysis indicates an overall increasing SM tendency, and the mean trends (averaged across stations with trends passing a 95\% significance level test) are 9.35 x 10(-7), 7.37 x 10(-3), and 2.45 x 10(-3) cm(3) cm(-3) yr(-1), respectively. SM memory depends on the soil depth and regions, and it has longer retention time in the deeper layers. Furthermore, the correlation between SM and antecedent Pr varies with soil depth and lag time. The antecedent Pr anomaly (1 or 2 months in advance) can be used to some extent as a surrogate SM anomaly in most regions except for in arid regions. This result is further demonstrated by the relationships between the SM anomaly and the standardized precipitation index. The current SM dataset can be used in various applications, such as validating satellite-retrieved products and model outputs.},

There is need to create relation among these parameters to deduce soil water content as to limit cost of introducing sensors. The present investigation means to measure the progression of these four parameters in a green infrastructure site in an urban landscape and to additionally create correlations among them. An incorporated field testing and statistical modeling approach is embraced to accomplish the objective. Four sites including bare, grassed and treed soil are chosen for examination. Field monitoring was first directed to monitor the above mentioned four parameters for two months. This is trailed by statistical modeling using artificial intelligence (AI) approach (i.e., artificial neutral networks (ANN)). Correlations are created for evaluating soil water content as function of EC, RH and temperature for the four sites. Regardless of the sort of cover, EC is strongly correlated to soil water content, followed by RH and soil temperature. The correlation of EC is strongest in vegetated soil when compared with bare soil. The relationship of soil temperature with water content of soil do not have a decisive pattern. Ensuring drying of soils does not increase temperature fundamentally after precipitation. Uncertainty investigation additionally presumes that water content of soil follows normal distribution function in treed soils, while it follows skewed distribution in the cases of grassed and bare soils.

Therefore, we propose a novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism which is suitable for soil moisture sensors and design a sensor target allocation model (STAM) for the actual agricultural situation. After that, a quantum clone elite genetic algorithm (QCEGA) is proposed; then, QCEGA is applied to optimize the STAM for obtaining optimal results. QCEGA uses the parallel mechanism of quantum computing to encode individuals, integrates the quantum revolving gate in quantum computing and the concept of cloning in biology to avoid the algorithm from falling into local optimum, and applies the elite strategy to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is compared with simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Under the novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism, the simulation results demonstrate that the network efficiency based on QCEGA is higher than that of SA and PSO; what is more, QCEGA has better convergence performance. In comparison with traditional wireless sensor network efficiency evaluation approaches, our methods are more in line with the development of modern agriculture and can effectively improve the efficiency of SMWSNs, thus ensuring that crops can have a better growth condition.},

The results demonstrated that the application of an IRCIS can effectively increase plant available moisture content (0-5.0 m) of declining Robinia pseudoacacia forests. In particular, IRCIS treatment significantly increased xylem conduit diameter and plant hydraulic conductivity while substantially reducing the percentage loss of hydraulic conductivity in both roots and branches. Furthermore, IRCIS treatment significantly reduced the root biomass and distribution depth of Robinia pseudoacacia during both wet and dry years. This implies that IRCISs are beneficial for plant growth and survival.

Due to traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil nutrient variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess nutrients, reducing the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting high-quality farmland. Traditional farming methods can no longer meet the requirements, and modern technology must be used to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients during plant growth. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, speed, economy, and regular monitoring. It provides new ideas and technical guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land development and consolidation projects.

The neutron counts displayed clear variations among different plots, and an equation could represent the relationship between neutron intensity and multiple variables near the ground. The parameter N-0 was the smallest for grassland and greatest for desert, and there was a significant negative correlation between Normalized Difference Vegetation Index and N-0 (P {\textless}0.05). Furthermore, the performance of CRNS notably improved after considering soil lattice water and soil organic matter. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the measured and oven-dried soil moisture increased with radius.

Moreover, the suitability of a curve-fitting-based model, available in the literature, for attaining the entire retention curve (beyond the capacity of HCTs) was evaluated. The SWRCs for the tests with a controlled evaporation rate were found to generally exhibit higher suction at a given water content, hence inducing air-entry values that were on average 16\% higher than those obtained from tests without evaporation rate control. It was also found that for suction in excess of 2 MPa, the curve-fitting-based model predictions of data obtained from tests with a controlled evaporation rate exhibited significantly lower suction at a given water content than those without evaporation rate control, suggesting that such curve fitting correlations should be used with caution.},

Due to the disturbance effect of the incident angle, microwave frequency and soil type on the Fresnel reflection coefficient in surface reflectivity, a normalization method of Fresnel reflection coefficient was proposed after analyzing the data characteristics of variables in the Fresnel reflection coefficient. Finally, combined with the soil moisture retrieval method of linear equation, the accuracy was compared and verified by using measured data, SMAP products and official CYGNSS products. The results indicate that the normalization method of the Fresnel reflection coefficient could effectively reduce the influence of relevant parameters on the Fresnel reflection coefficient, but the normalization effect became worse at large incident angles (greater than 65 \& DEG;). Compared with the official CYGNSS product, the retrieval accuracy of optimized soil moisture was improved by 10\%. The method proposed in this paper will play an important reference role in the study of soil moisture retrieval using spaceborne GNSS-R data.},

In this study, a low-cost soil resistivity sensor YL-69 was used to characterize the dynamics of soil moisture content and its pH value. Laboratory calibrated regression models were developed for three types of soils, i.e., clay, thionic, and fine sandy loamy to evaluate the effect of soil temperature and the depths of sensor on the apparent soil moisture content and pH value with a single resistive sensor. The prediction models were found to be accurate with the accuracy of 98\%. The findings obtained from this study could provide inexpensive and accurate simultaneous soil moisture content and pH value measurement. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Citizen science, scientific work and data collection conducted by or with non-experts, is rapidly growing. Although the potential of citizen science activities to generate enormous amounts of data otherwise not feasible is widely recognized, the obtained data are often treated with caution and scepticism. Their quality and reliability is not fully trusted since they are obtained by non-experts using low-cost instruments or scientifically non-verified methods. In this study, we evaluate the performance of Parrot's Flower Power soil moisture sensor used within the European citizen science project the GROW Observatory (GROW; https://growobservatory.org, last access: 30 March 2020). The aim of GROW is to enable scientists to validate satellite-based soil moisture products at an unprecedented high spatial resolution through crowdsourced data. To this end, it has mobilized thousands of citizens across Europe in science and climate actions, including hundreds who have been empowered to monitor soil moisture and other environmental variables within 24 high-density clusters around Europe covering different climate and soil conditions. Clearly, to serve as reference dataset, the quality of ground observations is crucial, especially if obtained from low-cost sensors. To investigate the accuracy of such measurements, the Flower Power sensors were evaluated in the lab and field. For the field trials, they were installed alongside professional soil moisture probes in the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) in Petzenkirchen, Austria. We assessed the skill of the low-cost sensors against the professional probes using various methods. Apart from common statistical metrics like correlation, bias, and root-mean-square difference, we investigated and compared the temporal stability, soil moisture memory, and the flagging statistics based on the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) quality indicators. We found a low intersensor variation in the lab and a high temporal agreement with the professional sensors in the field. The results of soil moisture memory and the ISMN quality flags analysis are in a comparable range for the low-cost and professional probes; only the temporal stability analysis shows a contrasting outcome. We demonstrate that low-cost sensors can be used to generate a dataset valuable for environmental monitoring and satellite validation and thus provide the basis for citizen-based soil moisture science.},

Using sensitivity and GIS analysis methods, this paper studies soil nutrient sensitivities and their spatial distribution patterns in the context of LUI and climate change. The results showed significant response differences and spatial heterogeneity regarding the sensitivity of soil nutrient systems to LUI and climate change. Among them, soil nutrients were the most sensitive to temperature changes, followed by LUI, while precipitation was the weakest. Soil nutrient sensitivity showed a decreasing spatial distribution pattern from the northeast to the southwest. The soil nutrient system had a strong adaptability to LUI and climate change. However, there were differences in different sensitivity states.

The objective of this study was to answer this question. Three replicates of twelve lysimeters, each 8000 cm(2), were packed with an Atlantic Canada representative soil to cultivate potatoes with four treatments of soil amendments (T-1 = control [no added nutrients], T-2 = B [biochar], T-3 = F [synthetic fertilizer @ recommended NPK], and T-4 = B + F [biochar + recommended NPK]) under a completely randomized block design with factorial arrangements. Chemical analyses of soils were conducted for physical, hydrological, and chemical (including concentration of macro- and micro-nutrients) prior to and after the completion experiments to evaluate soil fertility and its resulting effects on crop yield. The biochar amendment improved soil micro- and macro-nutrients. Soil organic matter, pH, and cation exchange capacity (ECE) significantly increased by application of biochar. The maximum potato yield of 30,467.4 kg h(-1) was achieved by the combined application of biochar and synthetic fertilizer as this combination resulted in the maximum net benefit ({\textbackslash}4433.98 ha(-1)) in comparison with control treatment that had net loss of {\textbackslash}- 2621.49 ha(-1). It is therefore concluded that biochar amendment of soils resembling to that of the Atlantic Canada representative soil used in this study, with a mix of recommended NPK for, can formulate a smart precision farming nutrient management technique for this region subject to the field trials and replicate experimental treatments for more than three times.},

Nutrients, their presence, concentration, and effectiveness, are key components in data-driven agriculture. Assessing macro and micro-nutrients, as well as factors such as water and pH, helps determine soil fertility, which is vital for supporting healthy plant growth and high crop yields. Insufficient soil nutrient assessment during continuous cropping can threaten long-term agricultural viability. Soil nutrients need to be measured and replenished after each harvest for optimal yield. However, existing soil testing procedures are expensive and time-consuming. The proposed research aims to assess soil nutrient levels, specifically nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, to provide critical information and guidance on restoring optimal soil fertility. In this research, a novel chip-level colorimeter is fabricated to detect the N and P elements of soil onto a handheld colorimeter or spectrophotometer. Chemical reaction with soil solution generates color in the presence of nutrients, which are then quantitatively measured using sensors. The test samples are collected from various farmlands, and the results are validated with laboratory analysis of samples using spectrophotometers used in laboratories. ANOVA test has been performed in which F value {\textgreater} 1 in our study indicates statistically significant differences between the group means. The alternate hypothesis, which proposes the presence of significant differences between the groups, is supported by the data.

Current soil moisture monitoring schemes via in situ station networks are sparsely distributed while remote sensing satellite soil moisture maps have a very coarse spatial resolution. In this study, an empirical surface soil moisture (SSM) model was established via fusion of in situ continental and regional scale soil moisture networks, remote sensing data (SMAP and Sentinel-1) and high-resolution land surface parameters (e.g., soil texture, terrain) using a quantile random forest (QRF) algorithm. The model had a spatial resolution of 100m and performed well under cultivated, herbaceous, forest, and shrub soils (overall R-2 = 0.524, RMSE = 0.07 m(3) m(-3)). It has a relatively good transferability at the regional scale among different soil moisture networks (mean RMSE = 0.08-0.10 m(3) m(-3)). The global model was applied to map SSM dynamics at 30-100m across a field-scale soilmoisture network (TERENO-Wustebach) and an 80-ha cultivated cropland in Wisconsin, USA. Without the use of local training data, the model was able to delineate the variations in SSM at the field scale but contained large bias. With the addition of 10\% local training datasets (”spiking”), the bias of the model was significantly reduced. The QRF model was relatively insensitive to the resolution of Sentinel-1 data but was affected by the resolution and accuracy of soil maps. It was concluded that the empirical model has the potential to be applied elsewhere across the globe to map SSM at the regional to field scales for research and applications. Future research is required to improve the performance of the model by incorporating more field-scale soil moisture sensor networks and assimilation with process-based models.},

	abstract = {Storing a significant portion of the global carbon (C) stocks, soils of the boreal forest display a high degree of spatial heterogeneity across the landscape, arising from variation in forest structure and landscape morphology, as well as natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Because of this high degree of variability, accurately quantifying C storage in this ecosystem poses a challenge. Forestry is an important feature of Canada's natural resource-based economy, but there is still considerable uncertainty on how management practices will affect boreal soil C sequestration in the long-term. With increasing pressures due to a changing climate and intensified forest management, developing better tools and techniques to quantify soil C dynamics is of paramount importance. In this study, we measured soil C stocks and associated properties in the forest floors and mineral soils (0-7 cm) of conifer-dominated and deciduous (broadleaf)-dominated boreal forest stands, 17 years following variable retention harvest. We investigated if the We Areas Mapping-based depth-to-water (DTW) index, derived from remotely sensed Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, was related to soil properties of unharvested stands. In addition, relationships between harvest-induced changes in soil properties and the DTW index were examined. In unharvested stands, several forest floor properties were related to DTW. However, these relationships were stand-specific. In unharvested conifer-dominated stands, forest floor C stocks were positively related to site wetness, while in harvested stands there was no relationship; this suggests that C was differentially lost from wetter sites following harvesting. Conversely, in unharvested deciduous-dominated stands, there was no relationship between forest floor C stocks and site wetness, but in harvested stands, wetter sites had higher C stocks. The DTW index was more strongly related to soil properties in the mineral soil (0-7 cm) than in the forest floor. In both forest cover types, mineral soil C and N concentrations, and C stocks, increased with increasing wetness. Relationships between mineral soil properties and DTW were not stand-specific, and were of similar magnitude under deciduous-dominated and conifer-dominated cover. In addition, harvest and forest regeneration had limited impact on the relationships between DTW and mineral soil properties. This study highlights the potential of using remote sensing and the DTW index to model forest floor and mineral soil properties in the boreal forest. In turn, this approach may be utilized in effective forest management strategies that aim to conserve boreal C stocks.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key parameter for the circulation of water and energy exchange between surface and the atmosphere, playing an important role in hydrology, agriculture, and meteorology. Traditional methods for monitoring soil moisture suffer from spatial discontinuity, time-consuming processes, and high costs. Remote sensing technology enables the non-destructive and efficient retrieval of land information, allowing rapid soil moisture monitoring to schedule crop irrigation and evaluate the irrigation efficiency. Satellite data with different resolutions provide different observation scales. Evaluating the accuracy of estimating soil moisture based on open and free satellite data, as well as exploring the comprehensiveness and adaptability of different satellites for soil moisture temporal and spatial observations, are important research contents of current soil moisture monitoring. The study utilized three types of satellite data, namely GF-1, Landsat-8, and GF-4, with respective temporal and spatial resolutions of 16 m (every 4 days), 30 m (every 16 days), and 50 m (daily). The gray relational analysis (GRA) was employed to identify vegetation indices that selected sensitivity to soil moisture at varying depths (3 cm, 10 cm, and 20 cm). Then, this study employed random forest (RF), Extra Tree (ETr), and linear regression (LR) algorithms to estimate soil moisture at different depths with optical satellite data sources. The results showed that the accuracy of soil moisture estimation was different at different growth stages. The model accuracy exhibited an upward trend during the middle and late growth stages, coinciding with higher vegetation coverage; however, it demonstrated a decline in accuracy during the early and late growth stages due to either the absence or limited presence of vegetation. Among the three satellite images, the vegetation indices derived from GF-1 exhibited were more sensitive to vegetation characteristics and demonstrated superior soil moisture estimation accuracy (with R2 ranging 0.129-0.928, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.078), followed by Landsat-8 (with R2 ranging 0.117-0.862, RMSE ranging 0.017-0.088). The soil moisture estimation accuracy of GF-4 was the worst (with R2 ranging 0.070-0.921, RMSE ranging 0.020-0.140). Thus, GF-1 is suitable for vegetated areas. In addition, the ETr model outperformed the other models in both accuracy and stability (ETr model: R2 ranging from 0.117 to 0.928, RMSE ranging from 0.021 to 0.091; RF model: R2 ranging from 0.225 to 0.926, RMSE ranging from 0.019 to 0.085; LR model: R2 ranging from 0.048 to 0.733, RMSE ranging from 0.030 to 0.144). Utilizing GF-1 is recommended to construct the ETr model for assessing soil moisture variations in the farming land of northern China. Therefore, in cases where there are limited ground sample data, it is advisable to utilize high-spatiotemporal-resolution remote sensing data, along with machine learning algorithms such as ETr and RF, which are suitable for small samples, for soil moisture estimation.},

Soil moisture and salt content are more important in arid wetlands. The Ebinur Lake wetland is an important part of the ecological barrier of Junggar Basin in Xinjiang, China. The Ebinur Lake Basin is a representative area of the arid climate and ecological degradation in central Asia. It is of great significance to study the spatial distribution of soil moisture and salinity and its causes for land and wetland ecological restoration in the Ebinur Lake Basin. Based on the field measurement and Landsat 8 satellite data, a variety of remote sensing indexes related to soil moisture and salinity were tested and compared, and the prediction models of soil moisture and salinity were established, and the accuracy of the models was assessed. Among them, the salinity indexes D1 and D2 were the latest ones that we proposed according to the research area and data. The distribution maps of soil moisture and salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin were retrieved from remote sensing data, and the correlation analysis between soil moisture and salinity was performed. Among several soil moisture and salinity prediction indexes, the normalized moisture index NDWI had the highest correlation with soil moisture, and the salinity index D2 had the highest correlation with soil salinity, reaching 0.600 and 0.637, respectively. The accuracy of the BP neural network model for estimating soil salinity was higher than the one of other models; R-2 = 0.624, RMSE = 0.083 S/m. The effect of the cubic function prediction model for estimating soil moisture was also higher than that of the BP neural network, support vector machine and other models; R-2 = 0.538, RMSE = 0.230. The regularity of soil moisture and salinity changes seemed to be consistent, the correlation degree was 0.817, and the synchronous change degree was higher. The soil salinity in the Ebinur Lake Basin was generally low in the surrounding area, high in the middle area, high in the lake area and low in the vegetation coverage area. The soil moisture in the Ebinur Lake Basin slightly decreased outward with the Ebinur Lake as the center and was higher in the west and lower in the east. However, the spatial distribution of soil moisture had a higher mutation rate and stronger heterogeneity than that of soil salinity.},

This research focused on the spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture, vegetation cover, land surface temperature, and Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) under a biological watershed management practice in the Taleghan paired watershed, namely, treated (TW) and control watersheds (CW), in Alborz province, Iran. In this research, along with the remote sensing techniques, the soil moisture and vegetation cover data were measured and statistically analyzed in the three aspects of both TW and CW during a growth period from May to October 2017. The results indicated that soil moisture, vegetation cover, and land surface temperature values in the paired watershed were significantly different at the 0.01 level during the study period. The increased vegetation cover in the TW had an inverse effect on the land surface temperature and TVDI, while directly impacted the soil moisture content. The average TVDI in the CW was 0.83, while this index was found to be 0.69 in the TW. Unlike the vegetation cover and soil moisture, the results revealed that the southern aspects had the highest TVDI and land surface temperature compared to the northern and eastern aspects of both watersheds. However, the increased vegetation cover as a biological watershed management activity in the steep terrain and mountainous areas of TW led to an increased soil moisture and a decreased land surface temperature and soil dryness. As a result, decreasing soil dryness in the TW can exert vital controls on the water resources and increasing water availability. In the arid and semiarid countries such as Iran, a proper watershed management activity can effectively increase soil moisture and water availability in the watersheds. In particular, the vegetation cover protection and biological practices can be considered as practical solutions in the rehabilitation of exhausted watersheds in arid and semiarid environments.},

In order to synchronize this tradeoff, a field trial integrating potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) with lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus L.) and dolichos (Lablab purpureus L.) in intercropping system was conducted in the upper midland [1552 m above sea level (masl), lower highland (1894 masl) and upper highland (2552 masl)] agro-ecological zones of Kenya. Nitrogen gains from mineralization, fertilization, biological fixation, and outputs from biomass accumulation, leaching, volatilization and soil erosion were quantified using standard procedures. Soil N balance ranged from - 10.7 to - 18.1 kg N ha(-1) for sole potato, 4.1 to 6.6 kg N ha(-1) for intercropping and 2.9 to 22.3 kg N ha(-1) for sole legumes. The intermediate range of polyphenol and lignin contents in intercropping enhanced N mineralization with peak N release of 8 to 9 kg N ha(-1) matching with peak N uptake by potato (19.9 to 31.2 kg N ha(-1)). Nitrate was leached below the active root zone in sole potato cropping (4.2 to 46.6 kg N ha(-1)), a process that was diverged by the deep root systems of legume intercrops. These results suggest that legume intercropping can provide a means of balancing the nitrogen retained in the biomass and soil, thus offering a mechanism for optimizing the soil N balance in smallholder potato farming systems.},

	abstract = {The Hydrus-1D model is widely used for soil water content (SWC) simulations, wherein the exact configuration of soil hydraulic parameters is key to accuracy. To assess the feasibility of using “low-cost” multi-source remote sensing data to optimize the parameters of the Hydrus-1D model, five types of soil hydrodynamic parameter acquisition methods were designed for comparative evaluation, including the use of default parameters for soil texture types (DSHP), predictions from three and five soil mechanical composition parameters (NNP3/NNP5), inverse solutions from measured historical data (ISHD), and innovative introduction of historical remote sensing data (ERA-5 land reanalysis information and MODIS LAI products) instead of ground measured data for the inverse solution (ISRS). Two spring maize crops were planted in Beijing, China, in 2021 and 2022. Meteorological, soil, and crop data were collected as real measurements of the true values during the growth period. The boundary flux characteristics of the model simulation results were analyzed. The accuracy differences in the five approaches were compared from three perspectives: overall root zone, growth stage, and soil depth. The results showed that (1) evapotranspiration was the main pathway for soil water depletion in the root zone of maize; the actual total evapotranspiration accounted for 68.26 and 69.43\% of the total precipitation in 2012 and 2022, respectively. (2) The accuracy of the SWC simulations in the root zone was acceptable for different approaches in the following order: NNP5 (root mean squared error (RMSE) = 5.47\%) {\textgreater} ISRS (RMSE = 5.48\%) {\textgreater} NNP3 (RMSE = 5.66\%) {\textgreater} ISHD (RMSE = 5.68\%) {\textgreater} DSHP (RMSE = 6.57\%). The ISRS approach based on remote sensing data almost achieved the best performance while effectively reducing the workload and cost. (3) The accuracy of the SWC simulation at different growth stages was ranked as follows: seedling stage (mean absolute error (MAE) = 3.29\%) {\textgreater} tassel stage (MAE = 4.68\%) {\textgreater} anthesis maturity stage (MAE = 5.52\%). (4) All approaches' simulation errors exhibited a decreasing trend with increasing soil depth. The ISHD approach, based on the measured data, achieved the best performance at a depth of 60 cm (MAE = 2.8\%). The Hydrus-1D model optimized using multi-source remote sensing data can effectively simulate SWC in the maize root zone with low working cost, which is significant for applications in areas where it is difficult to obtain field soil hydrodynamic property parameters to simulate SWC at a global scale.},

The focus of the study is to explore the utility of ALOS PALSAR-2 in retrieving surface soil moisture using the polarization decomposition technique. The demonstration of the study is carried out in Malavalli village, southern India, an agricultural predominant area. The study involves field soil moisture sampling in synchronous with satellite pass, measuring soil properties, preprocessing of SAR data, polarization decomposition, proportional analysis, regression analysis, model calibration and validation. Van Zyl decomposition gave the highest surface scattering component (43\%) and reduced volumetric scattering component compared to Yamaguchi and Freeman-Durden decomposition. Surface scattering component of Yamaguchi decomposition gave a good coefficient of determination (R-2 = 0.8029) with field-measured surface soil moisture. The semi-empirical model (SEM) was developed using surface scattering component and depolarization ratio with adjusted R-2 = 0.75 at 95\% confidence interval. On its comparison with existing soil moisture models, it is observed that the developed model is performing well with RMSE and AE(max) of 1.81 and 2.88, respectively.

	abstract = {The occurrence of freeze-thaw cycles modifies water infiltration processes and surface runoff generation. Related processes are complex and are not yet fully investigated at field scale. While local weather conditions and soil management practices are the most important factors in both runoff generation and surface erosion processes, local terrain heterogeneities may significantly influence soil erosion processes in catchments with undulating terrain. This paper presents a field-based investigation of spatial and temporal heterogeneities in subsurface soil moisture and soil temperature associated with freezing, thawing, and snowmelt infiltration. The field setup consists of a combination of traditional point measurements performed with frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) and electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). The transect was approximately 70 m long and spanned an entire depression with a north-facing slope (average slope of 11.5\%) and a south-facing slope (average slope of 9.7\%). The whole depression was entirely covered with stubble. Observed resistivity patterns correspond well to the measured soil moisture patterns. During the observation period, the north facing slope froze earlier and deeper compared with the south facing slope. Freeze-thaw cycles were less pronounced in the north-facing slope than in the south-facing slope. There were also differences in soil temperature and soil moisture patterns between lower and upper parts of the monitored depression. These indicate that initiation and development of runoff related processes, and consequently soil erosion, in regions with freeze-thaw cycles may differ significantly depending on local terrain characteristics. Consequently, it indicates that spatial terrain heterogeneities, especially slope aspects, may be important when studying soil erosion processes, water flow and nutrient leaching in lowlands where patchy snowpacks and dynamic freeze -thaw cycles are predominating.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture information is key to irrigation water management, drought monitoring, and yield prediction. It plays a vital role in the water cycle and energy budget between the earth's surface and atmosphere. Hence, its monitoring is crucial for both natural and anthropogenic environments. While the current remote sensing-based global SM products available at coarser resolution (3/15 km) are unsuitable for field-level operations, the most widely used microwave remote sensing suffers from model complexities and in-situ data requirements. Weather conditions limit the alternate approaches such as optical/thermal. This study aims to map surface soil moisture (SSM) at 30 m spatial resolution in a semi-arid region by fusing optical, thermal, and microwave remote sensing data using bagging, boosting, and stacking machine learning approaches. The reference data were collected using a soil moisture meter. The covariates included radar backscatter from Sentinel-1, visible, near-infrared, shortwave infrared, land surface temperature, and spectral indices derived from Landsat 8. Boruta algorithm was used for feature selection which identified radar backscatter, modified normalized difference water index, and land surface temperature as the most critical covariates impacting the SSM. The random forest (RF) showed the highest correlation coefficient (r = 0.71), and least root mean square error (RMSE = 5.17\%). The cubist model had the least mean bias error (MBE = 0.21\%) during independent validation. Stacking of cubist, gradient boosting machine (GBM), and RF using elastic net (ELNET) as meta-learner further reduced the MBE (0.18\%) and RMSE (5.03\%) during the validation. Overall, stacking multiple machine learning models improved model prediction and can be recommended to improve the digital soil moisture mapping.},

	abstract = {In countries characterized by arid and semi-arid climates, a precise determination of soil moisture conditions on the field scale is critically important, especially in the first crop growth stages, to schedule irrigation and to avoid wasting water. The objective of this study was to apply the operative methodology that allowed surface soil moisture (SSM) content in a semi-arid environment to be estimated. SSM retrieval was carried out by combining two scattering models (IEM and WCM), supplied by backscattering coefficients at the VV polarization obtained from the C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), a vegetation descriptor NDVI obtained from the optical sensor, among other essential parameters. The inversion of these models was performed by Neural Networks (NN). The combined models were calibrated by the Sentinel 1 and Sentinel 2 data collected on bare soil, and in cereal, pea and onion crop fields. To retrieve SSM, these scattering models need accurate measurements of the roughness surface parameters, standard deviation of the surface height (hrms) and correlation length (L). This work used a photogrammetric acquisition system carried on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) to reconstruct digital surface models (DSM), which allowed these soil roughness parameters to be acquired in a large portion of the studied fields. The obtained results showed that the applied improved methodology effectively estimated SSM on bare and cultivated soils in the principal early growth stages. The bare soil experimentation yielded an R-2 = 0.74 between the estimated and observed SSMs. For the cereal field, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs yielded R-2 = 0.71. In the experimental pea fields, the relation between the estimated and measured SSMs revealed R-2 = 0.72 and 0.78, respectively, for peas 1 and peas 2. For the onion experimentation, the highest R-2 equaled 0.5 in the principal growth stage (leaf development), but the crop R-2 drastically decreased to 0.08 in the completed growth phase. The acquired results showed that the applied improved methodology proves to be an effective tool for estimating the SSM on bare and cultivated soils in the principal early growth stages.},

This paper focuses on evaluating the benefit of assimilating soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission into the USDA-FAS Palmer model for agricultural drought monitoring. This will be done by examining the standardized soil moisture anomaly index. The skill of the SMAP-enhanced Palmer model is assessed over three agricultural regions that have experienced major drought since the launch of SMAP in early 2015: (1) the 2015 drought in California (CA), USA, (2) the 2017 drought in South Africa, and (3) the 2018 mid-winter drought in Australia. During these three events, the SMAP-enhanced Palmer soil moisture estimates (PM+SMAP) are compared against the Climate Hazards group Infrared Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS) rainfall dataset and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) products. Results demonstrate the benefit of assimilating SMAP and confirm its potential for improving U.S. Department of Agriculture-Foreign Agricultural Service root-zone soil moisture information generated using the Palmer model. In particular, PM+SMAP soil moisture estimates are shown to enhance the spatial variability of Palmer model root-zone soil moisture estimates and adjust the Palmer model drought response to improve its consistency with ancillary CHIRPS precipitation and NDVI information.},

	abstract = {Generating accurate spatial information on soil organic matter (SOM) is increasingly important in the context of global environmental change. Both prediction models and environmental covariates influence the mapping results and accuracy, making them important factors in SOM mapping. The Bayesian spatial model INLA-SPDE is an emerging model, that has shown potential in digital soil mapping (DSM), but its application is still limited. Soil moisture, which affects soil water status and the decomposition of SOM, can be a potential predictor for mapping SOM. However, the difficulty of obtaining soil moisture measurements over a large area using groundbased methods hinders its application. Recently, high spatial resolution remote sensing (RS) has provided a possible way to generate soil moisture indices over a large area. However, the effectiveness of RS-based soil moisture indices on SOM mapping is unknown. Fourier transforms decomposed (FTD) variables based on vegetation indices have been proven effective in detecting time-series patterns of crop growth, thereby improving the mapping accuracy of farmland. Yet, the effectiveness of FTD variables has not been verified in other vegetation-covered areas. This paper examines the use of INLA-SPDE with three RS-based soil moisture indices (NSDSIs) and six FTD variables for SOM mapping compared to Random Forest (RF), in a study area with diverse vegetation cover in Anhui Province, China. The finding indicates that with the optimal combination of environmental covariates, INLA-SPDE yields a higher prediction accuracy than RF, with an increase of 18\% in R2. Either the RS-based soil moisture indices covariates or the FTD variables are effective in mapping SOM. When compared to using only natural environmental covariates, the best combination including RS-based soil moisture indices and FTD variables improved the mapping accuracy by 25\% in terms of R2, 21\% of LCCC, and 11\% of RMSE. Furthermore, quantitative prediction uncertainty maps are derived based on the INLA-SPDE. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of INLA-SPDE model with the RS-based soil moisture indices and Fourier transforms decomposed variables for SOM mapping.},

In this region, some of the paddy fields have been abandoned because of severe soil salinization. Therefore, effective agricultural management strategies are needed to manage soil salinization for achieving stable agricultural production. To realize effective management strategies, it is necessary to understand the spatiotemporal distribution of soil salinization. To evaluate and update the spatiotemporal soil salinization using remote sensing data, we first evaluate the relationship between soil electrical conductivity (ECe) and soil moisture content (SMC) during thy seasons. Subsequently, the effect of changes in this relationship on the normalized difference salinity index (NDSI) derived from remote sensing data for estimating soil ECe is evaluated. The relationship between ECe and NDSI, depending on the soil moisture conditions in the study area, is clarified. The findings of this study indicate that for estimating ECe using the NDSI, it is necessary to consider not only soil moisture conditions but also its quality at the time of satellite observation.},

Improper e-waste management of short-lived sensing components can reveal the contradictions of solutions aimed at environmental sustainability, which also degrade environmental health. Therefore, the development of low-cost, off-grid, biodegradable in-situ soil moisture sensing system (SMSS) is necessary for these regions. This article provides an overview of the current state-of-the-art in low-cost, off-grid, and biodegradable in-situ soil moisture sensing.

It also highlights the current research in biodegradable polymers used for moisture sensing. The challenges in combining low-cost, off-grid, and biodegradable soil moisture sensing are identified as a research gap. Finally, the underlining question of the “perfect” choice of SMSS is explored based on the trade-offs of performance, operational feasibility, and the newly proposed aspect of biodegradability, consequently suggesting context-specific decisions by consciously managing these tradeoffs.},

This paper focuses on soil moisture features across Northwest China, the core region of the Silk Road Economic Belt. Six soil moisture datasets from the period 1981-2020 were employed, which included ERA5 (the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Atmospheric Reanalysis 5), ESA-CCI (European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative), GLDAS (Global Land Data Assimilation System), MERRA-2 (The Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2), RSSSM (A Remote Sensing-based global 10-day resolution Surface Soil Moisture dataset), and SSM-Feng (Regional multimodal fusion of surface soil moisture data in China). The temporal and spatial variation of the linear trend and abrupt change characteristics at seasonal and annual scale were explored. The results are as follows: 1) ESA-CCI, GLDAS, and MERRA-2 showed a slow increase in annual soil moisture tendency at a rate of less than 0.001 m(3)/m(3)/year, while ERA5 and SSM-Feng showed a significant decreasing linear trend at a rate of 1.31 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year and 1.01 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year (p {\textless} 0.05), respectively. 2) In autumn and winter, only GLDAS and MERRA-2 showed significant increasing trends. In the growing season (i.e., from April to October), the soil moisture of ESA-CCI, GLDAS, and MERRA-2 significantly increased at the rates of 3.29 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year, 3.30 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year, and 6.64 x 10(-4) m(3)/m(3)/year (p {\textless} 0.05), respectively. 3) ERA5 and ESA-CCI have frequent abrupt changes in 1984, 1987, and 2006 for ERA5, 2010-2012 and 2019-2020 for ESA-CCI. 4) In terms of spatial variations, most datasets show that soil moisture has increased across most regions. The ERA5, ESA-CCI, GLDAS, MERRA-2, and SSM-Feng datasets show decreased soil moisture in the Tarim Basin. The conclusions of this study deepen the understanding of temporal and spatial variation in soil moisture in arid areas of Northwest China. Through these conclusions, a certain theoretical basis can be provided for the complex water cycle process in the arid region.},

When the set reached constant weight, the samples were taken to dry in an oven at 105 degrees C to determine the dry mass and later, determine the gravimetric moisture and convert it into volumetric. The volumetric moistures obtained were related to measured frequency variations and the adjustments were analyzed by regression, which was subjected to analysis of variance (p = 0.05), and related by a third-degree polynomial equation whose quality of the fit was verified with coefficient of determination (R-2). Findings The obtained moistures were related to the estimated moistures and evaluated by the root-mean-square error and straight 1:1. The results demonstrate that the sensors are not accurate for moistures in saturation, but representative and statistically acceptable results for moistures up to field capacity.

Thus, within the past decades various experimental methods and strategies have been developed to map spatial variations in soil moisture distribution and to monitor temporal changes. Our study examines the combination of electrical resistivity mapping and point observations of soil moisture to infer the spatial and the temporal variability of soil moisture. Over a period of around two years, we performed field measurements on six days to collect repeated electrical resistivity mapping data for a nine-hectare test site south-east of Berlin, Germany. Permanently installed TDR probes, temporary TDR measurements within permanently installed tubes, and gravimetric measurements using soil samples provided soil moisture data at various selected points. In addition, soil analysis and classification results are available for 132 regularly distributed positions up to depths of 1.2 m. We compare and link three-dimensional resistivity models obtained via data inversion to soil composition and soil moisture as provided by our point data. Both the soil samples and the resistivity models indicate a two-layer medium characterized by a sandy top layer with varying thickness and a loamy bottom soil. For all six field campaigns, we observe similar resistivity patterns reflecting the temporally stable influence of soil texture. While the overall patterns are stable, the range of resistivity values changes with soil moisture. Finally, to estimate spatial models of soil moisture, we link our soil moisture and resistivity data using empirical petrophysical models relying on a second order polynomial function. We observe a mean prediction error for soil moisture of +/-0.034 m3 \& BULL; m? 3 using all observation points while we notice that point-specific models further reduce the error. Thus, we conclude that our experimental and data analysis strategies represent a reliable approach to establish site-specific models and to estimate three-dimensional moisture distribution including temporal variations.},

The contributions of earthworm casts to soil nutrients dynamics cannot be fully understood unless the temporal changes in earthworm cast production and the related nutrient resource pools are explored in the field. Here, we recorded the daily surface cast production of earthworms and monthly change patterns of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) in casts in a subtropical plantation for one year and compared the nutrient concentrations and microbial community traits (structure and bacterial activity) in casts with those in bulk soils. Our objectives were to characterize the temporal patterns of earthworm cast production and the C and nutrients in casts and to assess the potential contribution of earthworm casts to soil fertility. The results showed that the annual surface cast production at the study site was 8.3 tons ha(-1); monthly cast production was {\textgreater}80 g m(-2) during April to November and {\textless}30 g m(-2) during December to March. The annual outputs of total organic C (TOC), total N (TN) and total P (TP) in surface casts were 68.10, 4.84 and 0.38 g m(-2), respectively; the annual outputs of available P (AP), NH4+-N and NO3–N were 22.4, 147.0 and 61.3 mg m(-2), respectively. The concentrations of TOC and TN in casts were higher during warm months, but NH4+-N was higher during cold months, while both the concentrations of TP and AP in casts were constant throughout the year. The nutrient concentrations were 1.6-4.3-fold greater, and the microbial biomass C and N contents were 7-8-fold greater in earthworm casts than those in bulk soils. However, the bacterial stress index (BSI) was significantly greater in casts than in the bulk soil, which implies that bacteria in casts were under stress. Accordingly, the ratio of fungal to bacterial biomass (F/B) was significantly higher in casts than in the bulk soil. Earthworm casting activity can process forest soil into a “new soil”, which forms large amounts of earthworm-induced hotspots of soil fertility. These resource pools in casts, with monthly fluctuated C and N and constant P, could be more readily accessed by fungi rather than bacteria. Earthworm casting activity potentially changes both the nutrients available and the interactions of plants and rhizosphere microbiota.},

The effect of land cover and anthropogenic agricultural activities such as irrigation on the estimation of the drought index VAI was analyzed. The VAI dynamics were very similar for the shrub and forest classes. The contribution of vegetation cover (VAI) was combined with the effect of soil water content (MAI) through a new drought index called the global drought index (GDI) to conduct a global analysis of drought conditions. The implementation of this combination on different test areas in the study region is discussed.},

	abstract = {Human-made adaptations in plant diversity, particularly the introduction of alien invasive plant species, can result in problems such as depletion of groundwater, extraction of natural water resources, and modifications in the local biodiversity. In addition to regulating ecosystems and accurate farming, precise forecasting of soil moisture in the vicinity of these exotic plant species can greatly assist in various other agricultural applications. In this study, we present an improved approach for predicting soil moisture levels at different depths in the vicinity of Prosopis Juliflora (IAPS) by integrating long short-term memory (LSTM) and complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). CEEMDAN is employed as a preprocessing and denoising technique to decompose the initial soil moisture data into several intrinsic mode functions (IMF). After that, LSTM is used to predict all the IMF (Intrinsic Mode Function) parts from the CEEMDAN process. The individual prediction outcomes of each IMF are combined to obtain the final prediction results. Soil moisture measurements were collected continuously in the Coimbatore area of Tamil Nadu at multi-layer soil depths of 10 cm, 30 cm, 60 cm, and 100 cm. The provided data was utilized for training models and achieving optimal accuracy in forecasting soil moisture levels one month prior. The proposed CEEMDAN-LSTM model achieved the highest R2, ranging from 0.985 to 0.995 at various depths when compared to RNN, LSTM, EMD-LSTM, EEMDLSTM models, and existing literature models. The results show that the proposed method works well at predicting soil moisture at different depths, which can help improve the planting pattern and schedule of native species to increase the area's green cover.},

Soil samples were performed at 36 points arranged in a 55 x 55 m grid.

For each soil attribute, the spherical, gaussian and exponential models were adjusted. After the semivariograms fitting, data interpolation for assessment of spatial variability of the variables was performed through ordinary kriging. The spherical and gaussian models were the most efficient models in estimation of soil attributes spatial variability, in most cases. Most of variables presented a regular spatial variability in their respective kriging maps, with some exceptions. In general, the kriging maps can be used, and we can take them as logistical maps for management and intervention practices in order to improve the soil fertility in the study areas.

The experiment was conducted from 2005 to 2015 in a no-tillage system, in Parana state, Brazil, in soil with sandy clay loam texture. The treatments consisted of four doses of DLM (0, 60, 120, and 180 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1)) in addition to mineral fertiliser (same amount for all treatments). The DLM application increased maize and black oat yield but did not affect soybean and wheat yield. The DLM improved all evaluated soil chemical attributes and, even with application on the soil surface and no soil disturbance, the effect was observed in deeper layers. Maize grain yield was strongly correlated with soil chemical attributes, especially with pH (positive) and potential acidity (negative). The DLM application, in addition to mineral fertilisation, increased grain yield in a rotation system, especially of maize, with the effect mainly attributed to improvement in soil acidity attributes and the effect on nutrient availability. The estimated dose of DLM for maximum maize yield was 150 m(3) ha(-1) year(-1), with 16\% increment in grain yield.},

Experimental methods to study karst systems mostly focus on analysing the entire aquifer. Despite their important role in recharge processes, the soil and epikarst receive limited attention, and the few available studies were performed at sites of similar latitudes. In this paper, we describe a new monitoring network that allows for the improvement of the understanding of soil and epikarst processes by including different karst systems with different land-cover types in different climate regions. Here, we present preliminary data form the network and elaborate on their potential to answer research questions about the role of soil and epikarst on karstic water flow and storage. The network measures soil moisture at multiple points and depths to understand the partitioning of rainfall into infiltration, evapotranspiration, and groundwater recharge processes. We installed soil moisture probes at five different climate regions: Puerto Rico (tropical), Spain (Mediterranean), the United Kingdom (humid oceanic), Germany (humid mountainous), and Australia (dry semi-arid). At each of the five sites, we defined two 20m x 20m plots with different land-use types (forest and grassland). At each plot, 15 soil moisture profiles were randomly selected and probes at different depths from the topsoil to the epikarst (in total over 400 soil moisture probes) were installed. Covering the spatio-temporal variability of flow processes through a large number of profiles, our monitoring network will allow researchers to develop a new conceptual understanding of evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge processes in karst regions across different climate regions and land-use types, and this will provide the base for quantitative assessment with physically based modelling approaches in the future.},

In this study, we conducted a N-15 tracer pot experiment involving five different fertilizer treatments in soils with five different total organic carbon levels under field conditions. The average NUE ranged from 36 to 56\% N-15-urea and 0.1 to 0.2\% residual N in the first and second seasons. The N retained in the soil ranged from 10 to 28\%, and the N lost to water and the atmosphere ranged from 29 to 39\% in the five soils. Compared with that in the low-fertility soils, NUE in the high-fertility soils was 20-45\% greater, and N loss was 1 -6\% lower. The results showed that higher soil fertility corresponded to higher NUE and lower N loss. We suggest that although the local customary N fertilizer application rate (N3; 165 kg N/ha) in the study area is reasonable for low-fertility soils, after soil fertility improvements, an approximately 50\% reduction of N fertilizer should be implemented.},

Low spatio-temporal resolution, about 25-40 km and 2-3 days, of the commonly used global microwave SM products limits their application at regional scales. In this study, we developed an algorithm to improve the SM spatio-temporal resolution using multi-source remote sensing data and a machine-learning model named the General Regression Neural Network (GRNN). First, six high spatial resolution input variables, including Land Surface Temperature (LST), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), albedo, Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Longitude (Lon) and Latitude (Lat), were selected and gap-filled to obtain high spatio-temporal resolution inputs. Then, the GRNN was trained at a low spatio-temporal resolution to obtain the relationship between SM and input variables. Finally, the trained GRNN was driven by the high spatio-temporal resolution input variables to obtain high spatio-temporal resolution SM. We used the Fengyun-3B (FY-3B) SM over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) to test the algorithm. The results show that the algorithm could successfully improve the spatio-temporal resolution of FY-3B SM from 0.25 degrees and 2-3 days to 0.05 degrees and 1-day over the TP. The improved SM is consistent with the original product in terms of both spatial distribution and temporal variation. The high spatio-temporal resolution SM allows a better understanding of the diurnal and seasonal variations of SM at the regional scale, consequently enhancing ecological and hydrological applications, especially under climate change.},

Over two seasons, we sampled groundwater level (GWL) and soil moisture (SM) ground truth data at two diverse locations at the Rokytka Peat bog within the Sumava Mountains, Czechia. These data served as reference data and were modeled with a suite of potential variables derived from digital surface models (DSMs) and RGB, multispectral, and thermal orthoimages reflecting topomorphometry, vegetation, and surface temperature information generated from drone mapping. We used 34 predictors to feed the random forest (RF) algorithm. The predictor selection, hyperparameter tuning, and performance assessment were performed with the target-oriented leave-location-out (LLO) spatial cross-validation (CV) strategy combined with forward feature selection (FFS) to avoid overfitting and to predict on unknown locations. The spatial CV performance statistics showed low (R-2 = 0.12) to high (R-2 = 0.78) model predictions. The predictor importance was used for model interpretation, where temperature had strong impact on GWL and SM, and we found significant contributions of other predictors, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Index (NDI), Enhanced Red-Green-Blue Vegetation Index (ERGBVE), Shape Index (SHP), Green Leaf Index (GLI), Brightness Index (BI), Coloration Index (CI), Redness Index (RI), Primary Colours Hue Index (HI), Overall Hue Index (HUE), SAGA Wetness Index (TWI), Plan Curvature (PlnCurv), Topographic Position Index (TPI), and Vector Ruggedness Measure (VRM). Additionally, we estimated the area of applicability (AOA) by presenting maps where the prediction model yielded high-quality results and where predictions were highly uncertain because machine learning (ML) models make predictions far beyond sampling locations without sampling data with no knowledge about these environments.

Previous studies have assessed soil moisture as a predictor of LFMC over small areas with limited data, but a comprehensive evaluation at sub-continental scale is still lacking, and the explanatory utility has not been evaluated under different aridity conditions. In this study, the utility was evaluated using microwave soil moisture data from the ESA ECV\_SM product from 1979 to 2018 and LFMC data from over 1000 sites in the coterminous United States. A time-lagged robust linear regression model was adopted, and the results were compared with analysis from in situ soil moisture measurements at adjacent sites. The results suggested that at most sites the LFMC correlates best with soil moisture within 60 days prior to LFMC sampling, and that the correlation is lower in areas with complex terrain. LFMC can be estimated from soil moisture with a mean RMSE of around 20\%. The correlation between LFMC and soil moisture is significant (p{\textless}0.01) in most regions, and is mostly stable in different years. The major fuel types with a high response to soil moisture include pine, redcedar, sagebrush, oak, manzanita, chamise, mesquite and juniper, depending on the region. The LFMC - soil moisture correlation varies with the aridity condition, and soil moisture has a higher explanatory utility on LFMC under dry conditions. An analysis using SMAP Level-4 product indicated that the surface and root-zone soil moisture perform similarly in LFMC estimation. This study suggests that microwave soil moisture data contain sufficient information on LFMC, and may serve as a reference for the development of more sophisticated LFMC estimation methods.

Zai technology has the ability to promote soil moisture retention and enhances soil fertility. A four-seasons field experiment was conducted to assess the impact of Zai technology combined with cattle manure and inorganic fertilizer on selected soil properties and sorghum yields in Kabati, Kitui County. The experiment was set up in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with eight treatments replicated thrice with sorghum Gadam as the test crop. Soil sampling was done at the beginning of the first season and at the end of the fourth season at a dept of 0-15 cm across each plot for laboratory analyses. From the results, the increase in electrical conductivity was significant at p {\textless} 0.05 in all the treatments after four cropping seasons. Total organic carbon significantly increased in Zai with cattle manure (p = 0.045), conventional with no input (p = 0.038) and conventional with cattle manure (p = 0.045). Available phosphorous significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) increased in treatments under Zai technology while total nitrogen significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) reduced after the four cropping seasons. There was a significant (p {\textless} 0.05) interactive effect of the tested factors on soil pH, electrical conductivity, total nitrogen, and available phosphorous at the end of the experiment. Moreover, there was significant (p {\textless} 0.05) interactive effects on grain yields (SR18 and SR19 seasons) and stover yields (SR18, LR19, and SR19 seasons), with higher yields being recorded in treatments under Zai technology. This study demonstrates the importance of Zai technology in increasing crop yield by trapping water and enhancing its retention and infiltration into the soil for uptake by plants. This study concluded that positive impacts on important soil properties and crop yield could be realized when Zai technology is utilized alongside either sole inorganics or a combination of organic and inorganic amendments and this could be used as a strategy to improve crop production in eastern Kenya and other similar areas.},

The traditional rice-fish coculture (RFC) and manure fertilization (Manure) may provide valuable insights to this transition. However, it remains elusive how long-term agricultural conversion influences microbial community structure, soil fertility, and food supply. Here, we performed six-year conversions of MRF to either RFC or Manure in a hilly area of Sichuan (China). We found that agricultural conversions exerted a greater impact than rice growing stages on bacterial community structure. The RFC bacterial network exhibited the highest modularity and robustness, but also harbored the most diverse keystone taxa, followed by Manure. In contrast, MRF displayed network properties that are characteristic of unstable communities. Importantly, RFC also exhibited the greatest capability in improving the preservation of soil organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, and has significantly increased soil pH ({\textgreater} 1.5 units). Yet, adopting traditional practices, particularly Manure, decreased rice yields, but fish harvested in RFC could offset the decrease in rice yield. Our field study highlights bacterial network structure and keystone taxa diversity as possible indicators for agriculture sustainability, but also incentivizes the integration of traditional RFC in developing novel sustainable agricultural practices.},

	abstract = {Monitoring nitrogen utilization efficiency and soil temperature in agricultural systems for timely intervention is essential for crop health with reduced environmental pollution. Herein, this work presents a high-performance multi-parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VOX)-doped laser-induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. The highly porous 3D VOX-doped LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V5S8)-doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self-assembled films. The heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the sensor with enhanced response to NOX and an ultralow limit of detection of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast response/recovery, good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10-110 degrees C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX. The unencapsulated sensor operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate NOX measurements. The capability to decouple nitrogen loss and soil temperature paves the way for the development of future multimodal decoupled electronics for precision agriculture and health monitoring.},

This was achieved using three densely instrumented in situ observation networks in China that have different environmental conditions, i.e., the Hebi, Naqu and Heihe sites. The European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative multi-satellite-retrieved SM product (CCI-SM) was also included for inter-comparison purposes. Standard validation scores indicated that the CLDAS-SM product has high correlation and low uncertainty with both surface and root-zone soil moisture observations. The target accuracy (0.04 m(3)m(-3)) was achieved over all three sites. Compared with the CCI-SM product, the CLDAS-SM product showed higher accuracy for the Hebi and Heihe sites but slightly lower accuracy for the Naqu site located at the centre of the Tibetan Plateau. Regionally, the unbiased root mean square difference between the CLDAS-SM and CCI-SM products was noticeably smaller within China than in neighbouring countries. Given that the performance of the CCI-SM product should be unaffected by country boundaries, the better performance of the CLDAS-SM product in China can be attributed primarily to the high-quality meteorological forcing data.},

The use of tree-ring data from co-occurring species with different summertime soil-moisture responses provides an opportunity to evaluate the occurrence and direction of soil-moisture changes. Here, we present a method that compares adjusted latewood growth between longleaf pine (Pinuspalustris Mill.) and chestnut oak (Quercusprinus L.) from 1969 to 2018 in the Uwharrie Mountains of central North Carolina, USA. We found that adjusted latewood sensitivity to soil moisture varied between species with the strongest response in September PDSI for longleaf pine (r = 0.47), and July PDSI for chestnut oak (r = 0.61). Large ({\textgreater} 0.20 or {\textless} - 0.20) radial growth differences between species occurred during 22 years of the 50-year study period and were strongly correlated with PDSI differences (r = 0.74, p {\textless} 0.001), while the correlation with the whole dataset (r = 0.34, p {\textless} 0.05) was less sensitive. Major growth difference years were predominately negative (n = 17), suggesting that this method is more effective at detecting summers with decreasing soil moisture between mid and late summer. Overall, these results indicate that a differential response between species with dissimilar latewood formation periods may provide a means to examine potential intermonthly changes in summertime soil-moisture conditions as opposed to a single proxy value (e.g., anomalously dry, or wet) characterizing the entire summer.},

	abstract = {Currently, soil-moisture data extracted from microwave data suffer from poor spatial resolution. To overcome this problem, this study proposes a method to downscale the soil moisture spatial resolution. The proposed method establishes a statistical relationship between low-spatial-resolution input data and soil-moisture data from a land-surface model based on a neural network (NN). This statistical relationship is then applied to high-spatial-resolution input data to obtain high-spatial-resolution soil-moisture data. The input data include passive microwave data (SMAP, AMSR2), active microwave data (ASCAT), MODIS data, and terrain data. The target soil moisture data were collected from CLDAS dataset. The results show that the addition of data such as the land-surface temperature (LST), the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the normalized shortwave-infrared difference bare soil moisture indices (NSDSI), the digital elevation model (DEM), and calculated slope data (SLOPE) to active and passive microwave data improves the retrieval accuracy of the model. Taking the CLDAS soil moisture data as a benchmark, the spatial correlation increases from 0.597 to 0.669, the temporal correlation increases from 0.401 to 0.475, the root mean square error decreases from 0.051 to 0.046, and the mean absolute error decreases from 0.041 to 0.036. Triple collocation was applied in the form of [NN, FY3C, GEOS-5] based on the extracted retrieved soil-moisture data to obtain the error variance and correlation coefficient between each product and the actual soil-moisture data. Therefore, we conclude that NN data, which have the lowest error variance (0.00003) and the highest correlation coefficient (0.811), are the most applicable to Qinghai Province. The high-spatial-resolution data obtained from the NN, CLDAS data, SMAP data, and AMSR2 data were correlated with the ground-station data respectively, and the result of better NN data quality was obtained. This analysis demonstrates that the NN-based method is a promising approach for obtaining high-spatial-resolution soil-moisture data.},

	abstract = {Irrigation scheduling plays a pivotal role in water management. Conventional irrigation methods often struggle to maintain consistent moisture across fields due to uniform water application irrespective of field conditions and soil moisture levels. Automatic soil moisture sensors offer a solution by tailoring irrigation based on field conditions. These systems trigger irrigation when soil is too dry or skip it when moisture levels are sufficient. Hence, setting the right threshold value is key for sensor -based irrigation. This study involved laboratory testing of an irrigation controller, and determining soil matric potential and volumetric water content at various thresholds (1 to 9) for Fargo Silty Clay soil. Subsequently, a field experiment assessed its performance for a drip irrigation system at different thresholds (5, 6, 7, and 8) for watermelon cultivation, both with and without clear plastic mulch, in a randomized layout. Thresholds 5, 6, 7, and 8 (-35, -45, -55, and -70 kPa), along with no irrigation, were considered with one irrigation event daily. Results from laboratory and field tests underscore the controller's efficacy in managing drip irrigation timing and duration. Notably, threshold 7 (-55 kPa) combined with clear plastic mulch emerged as the most optimal treatment, yielding the highest watermelon production of 129.6 tons/ha. Moreover, this approach delivered premium produce quality, but utilizing only 142.2 mm of irrigation water. This study emphasizes the role of precise irrigation scheduling. By integrating smart technology and thoughtful threshold setting, agricultural practices can be elevated, yielding abundant crops while conserving water and promoting sustainability.},

	abstract = {The coarse scale of passive microwave surface soil moisture (SSM) is not suitable for regional agricultural and hydrological applications such as drought monitoring and irrigation management. The optical/thermal infrared (OTI) data-based passive microwave SSM downscaling method can effectively improve its spatial resolution to fine scale for regional applications. However, the estimation capability of SSM with long time series is limited by OTI data, which are heavily polluted by clouds. To reduce the dependence of the method on OTI data, an SSM retrieval and spatio-temporal fusion model (SMRFM) is proposed in the study. Specifically, a model coupling in situ data, MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer (MODIS) OTI data, and topographic information is developed to retrieve MODIS SSM (1 km) using the least squares method. Then the retrieved MODIS SSM and the spatio-temporal fusion model are employed to downscale the passive microwave SSM from coarse scale to 1 km. The proposed SMRFM is implemented in a grassland dominated area over Naqu, central Tibet Plateau, for Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-Earth Observing System sensor (AMSR-E) SSM downscaling in unfrozen period. The in situ SSM and Noah land surface model 0.01 degrees SSM are used to validate the estimated MODIS SSM with long time series. The evaluations show that the estimated MODIS SSM has the same temporal resolution with AMSR-E and obtains significantly improved detailed spatial information. Moreover, the temporal accuracy of estimated MODIS SSM against in situ data (r = 0.673, mu bRMSE = 0.070 m(3)/m(3)) is better than the AMSR-E (r = 0.661, mu bRMSE = 0.111 m(3)/m(3)). In addition, the temporal r of estimated MODIS SSM is obviously higher than that of Noah data. Therefore, this suggests that the SMRFM can be used to estimate MODIS SSM with long time series by AMSR-E SSM downscaling in the study. Overall, the study can provide help for the development and application of microwave SSM-related scientific research at the regional scale.},

	abstract = {Soil fertility affects crop yield and quality. A quick, accurate evaluation of soil fertility is crucial for agricultural production. Few satellite image-based evaluation studies have quantified soil fertility during the crop growth period. Therefore, this study proposes a new approach to the quantitative evaluation of soil fertility. Firstly, the optimal crop spectral variables were selected using the integration of an extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm with variance inflation factor (VIF). Then, based on the optimal crop spectral variables where the red-edge indices were introduced for the first time, the estimation models were developed using the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm to assess soil fertility. The model was finally adopted to map the soil fertility using Sentinel-2 imagery. This study was performed in the Conghua District of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. The results of our research are as follows: (1) five crop spectral variables (inverted red-edge chlorophyll index (IRECI), chlorophyll vegetation index (CVI), normalized green-red difference index (NGRDI), red-edge position (REP), and triangular greenness index (TGI)) were the optimal variables. (2) The BPNN model established with optimal variables provided reliable estimates of soil fertility, with the determination coefficient (R-2) of 0.66 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17. A nonlinear relation was found between soil fertility and the optimal crop spectral variables. (3) The BPNN model provides the potential for soil fertility mapping using Sentinel-2 images, with an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 0.09 for the measured and estimated results. This study suggests that the proposed method is suitable for the estimation of soil fertility in paddy fields.},

Therefore, this study first introduces a parameterization scheme to describe the effect of SOC content on soil hydraulic and thermal parameters in a land surface model (LSM), and then the SOC content is estimated by minimizing the difference between observed and simulated surface-layer soil moisture. The accuracy of the estimated SOC content was evaluated using in situ observation data at a soil moisture and temperature-measuring network in Naqu, central Tibetan Plateau. Sensitivity experiments show that the optimum time window for stabilizing the estimation results cannot be shorter than three years. In the experimental area, the estimated SOC content can generally reflect the spatial distribution of the measurements, with a root mean square error of 0.099 m(3) m(-3), a mean bias of 0.043 m(3) m(-3), and a correlation coefficient of 0.695. The estimated SOC content is not sensitive to the temporal frequency of the soil moisture data input. Even if the temporal frequency is as low as that of current soil moisture products derived from passive microwave satellites, the estimation result is still stable. Therefore, by combining a high-quality satellite soil moisture product and a parameter optimization method, it is possible to obtain grid-scale effective parameter values, such as SOC content, for an LSM and improve the simulation ability of the LSM.},

Nevertheless, the persisting challenge is to design and construct stable materials with the requisite sensitivity, selectivity, and high performance. Here, we report the introduction of porous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), as the receptor layer, in capacitive sensors to efficiently sense moisture in two types of soil. Namely, our study unveiled that Cr-soc-MOF-1 offers the best sensitivity (approximate to 24,000 pF) among the other tested MOFs for any given range of soil moisture content, outperforming several well-known oxide materials. The corresponding increase in the sensitivities for tested MOFs at 500 Hz are approximate to 450, approximate to 200, and approximate to 30\% for Cr-soc-MOF-1, Al-ABTC-soc-MOF, and Zr-fum-fcu-MOF, respectively. Markedly, Cr-soc-MOF-1, with its well-known water capacity, manifests an excellent sensitivity of approximate to 450\% in clayey soil, and the analogous response time was 500 s. The noted unique sensing properties of Cr-soc-MOF-1 unveils the great potential of MOFs for soil-moisture sensing application.},

	abstract = {Attributing to the flexibility in considering various types of observation error and model error, data assimilation has been increasingly applied to dynamically improve soil moisture modeling in many hydrological practices. However, accurate characterization of model error, especially the part caused by defective model structure, presents a significant challenge to the successful implementation of data assimilation. Model structural error has received limited attention relative to parameter and input errors, mainly due to our poor understanding of structural inadequacy and the difficulties in parameterizing structural error. In this paper, we present a dynamic data-driven approach to estimate the model structural error in soil moisture data assimilation without the need for identifying error generation mechanism or specifying particular form for the error model. The error model is based on the Gaussian process regression and then integrated into the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) to form a hybrid method for dealing with multi-source model errors. Two variants of the hybrid method in terms of two different error correction manners are proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed method is tested through a suit of synthetic cases and a real-world case. Results demonstrate the potential of the proposed hybrid method for estimating model structural error and providing improved model predictions. Compared to the traditional EnKF without explicitly considering the model structural error, parameter compensation issue is obviously reduced and soil moisture retrieval is substantially improved.},

	abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is critical for ecosystem protection and water services, especially in the mountainous areas of arid and semi-arid watersheds. The lysimeter and Eddy Covariance (EC) methods are widely used for directly measuring ET, but are difficult to install and apply in mountainous areas with complex topography. The commonly used indirect methods for estimating ET, such as the Penman-Monteith (PM) method, present significant challenges in mountainous areas with scarce data. The simple soil water balance (SWB) method, which estimates ET from soil moisture dynamics, is another reliable and simple method for estimating ET. However, a drawback of the original SWB method is that it assumes soil moisture depletion only occurs through ET, ignoring the process of deep percolation. This restriction limits the applicability of the SWB method. In this study, we improve the SWB method (ISWB) by incorporating a deep percolation module into the soil water balance equation. Subsequently, we compare the estimated ET obtained from the ISWB, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-56 PM, and the Hargreaves-Samani (HS) methods with the observed ET. Results show that the ISWB method for estimating ET performs better when using the soil moisture of the 0-25 cm and below layers, compared to the 0-20 cm and above layers. Meanwhile, there is no significant difference in performance between using the soil moisture of the 0-25 cm layer and the soil layers below 25 cm. In addition, ignoring interception evaporation has an obvious influence on ET estimation using the ISWB. Furthermore, the comparison indicated that the performance of the ISWB method is superior to that of the FAO-56 PM and HS methods in the study areas. Our study shows that the ISWB method has significant potential for ET estimation in data-scarce and topographic-complex mountainous areas.},

Hence, in this study, measured satellite-based SM data obtained from different spatial scales were merged, and the model state and parameters were updated in real time via the data assimilation method named ensemble Kalman filter. Four different assimilation settings were used for the forecasting of different floods at three hydrological stations in the Chaohe River Basin: flood forecasting without data assimilation (NA case), assimilation of runoff data (AF case), assimilation of runoff and satellite-based soil moisture data (AFWR case), and assimilation of runoff and merged soil moisture data (AFWM case). Compared with NA, the relative error (RE) of small, medium, and large floods decreased from 0.53 to 0.23, 0.35 to 0.16, and 0.34 to 0.12 in the AF case, respectively, indicating that the runoff prediction was significantly improved by the assimilation of runoff data. In the AFWR and AFWM cases, the REs of the small, medium, and large floods also decreased, indicating that the soil moisture data play important roles in the assimilation of medium and small floods. To study the factors affecting the assimilation, the changes in the parameter mean and variance and the number of set samples were analyzed.

	abstract = {Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN) is a popular surface runoff prediction method because it is simple in principle, convenient in application, and easy to accept. However, the method still has several limitations, such as lack of a land slope factor, discounting the storm duration, and the absence of guidance on antecedent moisture conditions. In this study, an equation was developed to improve the SCS-CN method by combining the CN value with the tabulated CN2 value and three introduced factors (slope gradient, soil moisture, and storm duration). The proposed method was tested for calibration and validation with a dataset from three runoff plots in a watershed of the Loess Plateau. The results showed the model efficiencies of the proposed method were improved to 80.58\% and 80.44\% during the calibration and validation period, respectively, which was better than the standard SCS-CN and the other two modified SCS-CN methods where only a single factor of soil moisture or slope gradient was considered, respectively. Using the parameters calibrated and validated by dataset of the initial three runoff plots, the proposed method was then applied to runoff estimation of the remaining three runoff plots in another watershed. The proposed method reduced the root-mean-square error between the observed and estimated runoff values from 5.53 to 2.01 mm. Furthermore, the parameters of soil moisture (b(1) and b(2)) is the most sensitive, followed by parameters in storm duration (c) and slope equations (a(1) and a(2)), and the least sensitive parameter is the initial abstraction ratio lambda on the basis of the proposed method sensitivity analysis. Conclusions can be drawn from the above results that the proposed method incorporating the three factors in the SCS method may estimate runoff more accurately in the Loess Plateau of China.},

	abstract = {Global navigation satellite system (GNSS)-reflectometry is a type of remote sensing technology and can be applied to soil moisture retrieval. Until now, various GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval methods have been reported. However, there still exist some problems due to the complexity of modeling and retrieval process, as well as the extreme uncertainty of the experimental environment and equipment. To investigate the behavior of bistatic GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval process, two ground-truth measurements with different soil conditions were carried out and the performance of the input variables was analyzed from the mathematical statistical aspect. Moreover, the feature of XGBoost method was utilized as well. As a recently developed ensemble machine learning method, the XGBoost method just emerged for the classification of remote sensing and geographic data, to investigate the characterization of the input variables in the GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. It showed a good correlation with the statistical analysis of ground-truth measurements. The variable contributions for the input data can also be seen and evaluated. The study of the paper provides some experimental insights into the behavior of the GNSS-R soil moisture retrieval. It is worthwhile before establishing models and can also help with understanding the underlying GNSS-R phenomena and interpreting data.},

	doi = {10.3390/w13192652},
	abstract = {Soil moisture is a vital factor affecting the hydrological cycle and the evolution of soil and geomorphology, determining the formation and development of the vegetation ecosystem. The previous studies mainly focused on the effects of different land use patterns and vegetation types on soil hydrological changes worldwide. However, the spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil gravimetric water content in alpine regions are seldom studied. On the basis of soil sample collection, combined with geostatistical analysis and the geographical detector method, this study examines the spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil gravimetric water content in the typical alpine valley desert of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Results show that the average value of soil gravimetric water content at different depths ranges from 3.68\% to 7.84\%. The optimal theoretical models of soil gravimetric water content in 0-50 cm layers of the dune are different. The nugget coefficient shows that the soil gravimetric water content in the dune has a strong spatial correlation at different depths, and the range of the optimal theoretical model of semi-variance function is 31.23-63.38 m, which is much larger than the 15 m spacing used for sampling. The ranking of the influence of each evaluation factor on the alpine dune is elevation {\textgreater} slope {\textgreater} location {\textgreater} vegetation {\textgreater} aspect. The interaction detection of factors indicates that an interaction exists among evaluation factors, and no factors are independent of one another. In each soil layer of 0-50 cm, the interaction among evaluation factors has a two-factor enhancement and a nonlinear enhancement effect on soil gravimetric water content. This study contributes to the understanding of spatial heterogeneity and driving factors of soil moisture in alpine deserts, and guidance of artificial vegetation restoration and soil structure analysis of different desert types in alpine cold desert regions.},

	abstract = {Magnetic fields are widely used as a physical energy source in industry and environmental governance. Their application in agriculture has also been reported; however, it remains unknown whether magnetic fields can be used to increase the availability of phosphorus in wheat fields and whether they have an effect on increasing phosphorus availability in the rhizosphere. In this study, we conducted an incubation experiment for soil and a field control experiment for wheat cultivation. In the wheat cultivation experiment, four magnetic field intensity treatments of 20, 40, 60, and 80 mT were set with 0 mT as a control (CK). Under the magnetic field intensity of 60 mT, the available phosphorus content increased by 7.06\% at the booting stage, and acid phosphatase and alkaline phosphatase activities in rhizosphere soil increased by 19.89\% and 9.26\%, respectively, under 40 mT and by 12.16\% and 26.70\%, respectively, under 60 mT magnetic field intensities compared with CK. Moreover, compared with CK, the magnetic field mainly affected lipids and lipid-like molecules, organic oxygen compounds, phenylpropanoids, and polyketides in the rhizosphere metabolisms. The results of correlation analysis show that the abundance of rhizosphere metabolites was significantly correlated with the acid phosphatase activity, and the acid phosphatase activity was significantly correlated with the available phosphorus content. The results indicate that applying an appropriate magnetic field intensity to soil altered the abundance of wheat rhizosphere metabolites. Furthermore, the activity of phosphatase and the content of available phosphorus in the soil increased, which resulted in increased available phosphorus uptake by wheat plants. This study highlights that magnetic fields can be used as a means to increase phosphorus availability in soil.},

	abstract = {Estimating accurate surface soil moisture (SM) dynamics from space, and knowing the error characteristics of these estimates, is of great importance for the application of satellite-based SM data throughout many Earth Science/Environmental Engineering disciplines. Here, we introduce the Bayesian inference approach to analyze the error characteristics of widely used passive and active microwave satellite-derived SM data sets, at different overpass times, acquired from the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS), and Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) missions. In particular, we apply Bayesian hierarchical modeling (BHM) and triple collocation analysis (TCA) to investigate the relative importance of different environmental factors and human activities on the accuracy of satellite-based data.To start, we compare the BHM-based sensitivity analysis method to the classic multiple regression models using a frequentist approach, which includes complete pooling and no-pooling models that have been widely used for sensitivity analysis in the field of remote sensing and demonstrate the BHM's adaptability and great potential for providing insight into sensitivity analysis that can be used by various remote sensing research communities.Next, we conduct an uncertainty analysis on BHM's model parameters using a full range of uncertainties to assess the association of various environmental factors with the accuracy of satellite-derived SM data. We focus on investigating human-induced error sources such as disturbed surface soil layers caused by irrigation activities on microwave satellite systems, naturally introduced error sources such as vegetation and soil organic matter, and errors related to the disregard of SM retrieval algorithmic assumptions -such as the thermal equilibrium passive microwave systems. Based on the BHM-based sensitivity analysis, we find that assessments of SM data quality with a single variable should be avoided, since numerous other factors simultaneously influence their quality. As such, this provides a useful framework for applying Bayesian theory to the investigation of the error characteristics of satellite-based SM data and other time-varying geophysical variables.},

At present, active and passive remote sensing are the only two ways to monitor SM directly at the regional scale. However, the quality of a single satellite-based SM product is insufficient to meet the requirements of these applications. Hence, fusing these two SM products to improve their quality of change capture ability and accuracy is a necessary and challenging work. This study proposes an improved double instrumental variable method to fuse active and passive SM products. First, the method is improved in finding the best instrumental variables in time series based on the correlation coefficient. Second, fused weights of input SM products are estimated using the improved method. Finally, fused SM products are obtained with higher change capture ability and higher accuracy. The Tibetan Plateau (TP) was selected as the study area to test the algorithm using both of the climate change initiative (CCI) active and passive SM products from the European Space Agency (ESA). The ground validation results show that, compared with the original SM products, the change capture ability, expressed by the correlation coefficient (R), and the accuracy, expressed by the unbiased root mean square deviation (ubRMSD), have both been improved by about 10\% on average. Compared with the original method, the R and ubRMSD have been improved by more than 30\% on average. This study indicates that the proposed fusion method can effectively improve the quality of SM products to further understand the global changing water cycle.},

Comparisons were made between the NO3–N content of in-situ soil percolate solution and laboratory-prepared extract solution. Possible influential factors of sample depth, NO3–N content, soil texture, and moisture were varied. Field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) characterized morphology and content information of the composite film of ERGO/AuNPs. Due to the performance excellence for conductivity, stability, and hydrophobicity, the ISE with ERGO/AuNPs illustrates an acceptable detection range from 10(-1) to 10(-5) M. The response time was determined to be about 10 s. The lifetime was 65 days, which revealed great potential for the implementation of the ERGO/AuNPs mediated ISE for in-situ NO3–N monitoring.

	abstract = {Alternative grazing systems that incorporate cover crops may be useful to achieve a longer grazing season and maximize forage production. However, little is known about their impact on soil properties, especially in the presence or absence of cattle grazing in the early spring. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interacting effects of cropping systems with and without cattle grazing in rotation with corn or soybean on the balance and dynamics of soil fertility and enzyme activity. This study was conducted as a system experiment between 2015 and 2019 in Minnesota and Pennsylvania, USA. The experimental design was a randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments included presence or absence of cattle grazing and two types of cropping systems (pasture-rye-soybean-pasture [P-R-SB-P] and pasture-wheat/vetch-corn-pasture [P-W/V-C-P]. Soil samples were collected six times during the study. Soil properties analyzed were soil pH, organic matter, salinity, K, Ca, Mg, cation exchange capacity (CEC), P, beta-glucosidase, alkaline phosphatase, aryl-sulfatase, fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis, ammonium, nitrate, permanganate oxidizable carbon (POXC), N\%, C\%, S\%, and C:N ratio. Grazing increased glucosidase activity, available Ca, Mg, NO3-, NH4+, soil pH, soil C\%, S\%, and the C:N ratio. In the P-W/V-C-P cropping system, soil pH, available Ca, NO3-, and sulfatase activity were found to increase compared with the P-R-SB-P cropping system. In contrast, soil OM, available K, Mg, CEC, glucosidase, phosphatase, POXC, and total C\%, N\%, and S\% were greater in the P-R-SB-P cropping system compared with the P-W/V-C-P cropping system. The results of this study suggested that rotational grazing can increase soil quality and microbial decomposition under the P-W/V-C-P cropping system, and that this result was greater than under the P-R-SB-P cropping system, leading to a faster nutrient cycling. These results show promise for producers who are seeking methods to diversify their farming operation and reduce the need for external inputs.},

	abstract = {Well-designed temperate tree-based intercropping (TBI) systems can enhance soil nutrient cycling compared to conventional agricultural systems. To improve the TBI designs and their subsequent wide-scale adoption, greater understanding is required regarding the extent to which widely-spaced tree rows and tree management practices influence spatio-temporal dynamics of soil nutrients. Our 2-year study (2021 and 2022) assessed N-leaching and soil nutrient supply at increasing distances from tree rows (0, 4, 12, 20 m); the 10-year-old TBI system (50 trees ha-1) together with agricultural controls was established in southern Quebec (Canada). The TBI included hybrid poplars (Populus deltoides x P. nigra) planted alternately with high-value hardwoods in the rows. In each experimental block (n = 3), the TBI system and control were divided into two treatments: without root-pruning versus with (0.75 m depth using a sub-soiler). In 2022, NO3- supply rates near tree rows (0 and 4 m; 0.28 +/- 0.04 [mean +/- SE] and 0.37 +/- 0.05 mu g cm-2 d-1, respectively) were lower than alley centres (12 and 20 m) and controls (0.62 +/- 0.07, 0.52 +/- 0.07 and 0.82 +/- 0.07 mu g cm-2 d-1, respectively). A first structural equation modelling (SEM) analysis revealed that NO3- supply rates were mostly modulated by indirect effects of tree row distance and soil clay content through volumetric water content (VWC). Nitrate leaching (400-mm depth) at 0 and 4 m from the tree row was respectively 8.8 x and 7.5 x lower than that in the control. A second SEM analysis showed direct and indirect (through soil VWC affecting NO3- supply rates) effects of distance from tree rows on NO3- leaching rates. Within TBI, greater tree leaf litter dry-mass was trapped at 0 and 4 m versus 12 and 20 m. Phosphorus and K availability under tree rows was higher than all other distances within cultivated alleys and control plots. Phosphorus, K, Ca and Mg supplies within cultivated alleys were generally similar among distances (4, 12, and 20 m) and did not differ from controls. An unexpected lack of effect of tree root pruning was observed regarding soil nutrient supply and N leaching. Clay content was a major driver of soil nutrient supply and N leaching. The role of TBI systems in determining soil nutrient dynamics depended upon the soil nutrient and sampling period that was measured, with greater effects beneath the trees and at the tree-crop interface.},

SM dynamics from NASA MERRA-2 and ESA CCI are compared with those of SCAN, and an SM dataset is developed based on a spatiotemporal analysis. Our results show that the NASA MERRA-2 and ESA CCI SM datasets have different accuracies at the nine SCAN sites in different seasons. The MERRA-2 and CCI SM datasets have the highest accuracy at sites with the lowest number of extreme events, indicating that both datasets cannot robustly capture extremum soil moisture values. The highest (lowest) agreement between the MERRA-2/CCI and SCAN SM data is observed in April (February) with the nine-site average unbiased root-mean-square-difference (ubRMSD) of 0.0638 cm(3)/cm(3) (0.0914 cm(3)/cm(3)). In all the nine sites, the CCI SM data are more accurate than those of MERRA-2 in April-October. The CCI SM data shows greater accuracy in the sites with lower SM values and/or higher SM variability. MERRA-2 and CCI SM datasets show higher and lower accuracy at the sites with pasture and agricultural vegetation, respectively.

To address these issues, we have engineered a cutting-edge soil nutrient ion detection apparatus: the Microchip Electrophoresis Soil Nutrient Ion Portable Detection System (ME-SNI-PDS). This system, leveraging microchip electrophoresis with a capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detector (ME-C4D), simplifies the detection process with user-friendly touchscreen controls. Our system is capable of simultaneous detection of key soil nutrient ions-ammonium (NH4 +), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), potassium (K+), nitrate (NO3 -), and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4 -)-in a swift 180 s, facilitated by precise voltage regulation. We have refined the buffer solution, consisting of 20 mM 2-(N-morpholinyl)-ethanesulfonic acid and L-histidine, with the addition of 0.01 mM cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and 10 mM 18-crown-6, to ensure the complete resolution of soil nutrient ions. Following this, we established highly accurate peak height-to-concentration correlations for the six aforementioned ions, each with a coefficient of determination (R2) exceeding 0.99. The detection limits for these ions stand at a remarkably low concentration of 0.05 mM, translating to 0.9 mg l-1 for NH4 +, 2.0 mg l-1 for Ca2+, 1.2 mg l-1 for Mg2+, 1.96 mg l-1 for K+, 3.1 mg l-1 for NO3 -, and 4.85 mg l-1 for H2PO4 -. Subsequent soil leachate analysis via the ME-SNI-PDS has yielded ion content data that, upon comparison with results from continuous flow analyser (CFA) and inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, confirm the system's exceptional integration, compactness, portability, speed, and efficiency. The ME-SNI-PDS shows immense promise for application in precision agriculture and the prevention of surface soil pollution. It is poised to make a significant impact in the realm of crop fertilization and environmental stewardship.},

While winter snow cover has an important impact on spring SM, relatively little research has examined the correlation between winter snow cover and spring SM in great detail. To understand the effects of snow cover on SM over farmland, the relationship between winter snow cover parameters (maximum snow depth (MSD) and average snow depth (ASD)) and spring SM in Northeast China was examined based on 30 year passive microwave snow depth (SD) and SM remote-sensing products. Linear regression models based on winter snow cover were established to predict spring SM. Moreover, 4 year SD and SM data were applied to validate the performance of the linear regression models. Additionally, the effects of meteorological factors on spring SM also were analyzed using multiparameter linear regression models. Finally, as a specific application, the best-performing model was used to predict the probability of spring drought and waterlogging in farmland in Northeast China. Our results illustrated the positive effects of winter snow cover on spring SM. The average correlation coefficient (R) of winter snow cover and spring SM was above 0.5 (significant at a 95\% confidence level) over farmland. The performance of the relationship between snow cover and SM in April was better than that in May. Compared to the multiparameter linear regression models in terms of fitting coefficient, MSD can be used as an important snow parameter to predict spring drought and waterlogging probability in April. Specifically, if the relative SM threshold is 50\% when spring drought occurs in April, the prediction probability of the linear regression model concerning snow cover and spring SM can reach 74\%. This study improved our understanding of the effects of winter snow cover on spring SM and will be beneficial for further studies on the prediction of spring drought.},

The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) land surface temperature product and the Beijing Normal University (BNU) leaf area index product are employed to not only improve the estimation of temperature and vegetation variables from the CoLM, but they also provide more accurate background information for the RTM during the brightness temperature assimilation. In situ measurements from the Naqu network are used to evaluate the results. The model simulation showed an obvious underestimation of soil moisture and overestimation of soil temperature, which was alleviated by the assimilation experiments, particularly in the shallow soil layers. The estimated parameters also showed advantages in the soilmoisture simulation when compared with the default parameters. The assimilation experiment presents promising results in the combination of model and multisource remote sensing data for estimating soil moisture over the complex mountainous region in Tibet.},

Soil moisture (SM), rainfall (RF), and land use land cover (LULC) data were analyzed to identify the climatic and anthropogenic drivers that cause vegetation changes at the subdivision scale. Principal component analysis and MK (Mann-Kendall) test showed significant greening trend over semi-arid regions of Northwest India (NWI) and South India (SI) while slight browning trend seen over some of the subdivisions in Indo-Gangetic (IG) plains and Western Ghats (WG). It is found that the NDVI has superior correlation with soil moisture compared with rainfall and the croplands (CL) found to have significant increasing trend over the NWI and SI. Increasing trend in soil moisture over the NWI and SI may have contributed to increase in CL area and the greening trend. Over IG plains, the NDVI showed moderate correlation with SM and RF, and the greening trend (browning trend) in some regions can be attributed to increase in natural vegetation mosaic (decrease of CL). The NDVI has shown browning trend over the core monsoon regions of Madhya Pradesh (an increase of barren lands over west MP and decrease of CL over east MP) and Western Ghats (significant decrease of CL over Konkan and Goa). This study revealed that the soil moisture and LULC changes are the major driving factors for the vegetation changes over majority of the subdivisions in India.},

In this study, the subsidence and soil moisture of four coal seams (4101 and 4102 coal seams are 2-year and 1-year subsidence area, 4103 and 4104 coal seams are just after mining and ready for mining) in semi-arid region were monitored for a year. A soil moisture retrieval method suitable for semi-arid mining areas was improved. The results showed that the reduced Bias, MRE and RMSE difference between satellite and in situ soil moisture to 0.129, 0.0851 and 0.0219, respectively, which demonstrated the reliability of the proposed soil moisture retrieval method in the semi-arid mining areas. We found that there was ecological self-restoration, the degree of spatial variability of soil moisture was gradually weaker with the increased subsidence time by comparing coal seams with different subsidence time. The average value of soil moisture in 4103 and 4104 coal seams decreased by 0.20\% and 1.89\%, respectively, whereas the coefficient of variation increased by 13.99\% and 10.45\%, respectively. Window cross-correlation analysis shows underground mining activities have a lag effect. The mean time lag between subsidence and the soil moisture response varied 90 days after the subsidence occurred. But, about 120 days after the end of mining, soil moisture gradually recovers. All these results indicated repair of land cracks in time at subsidence edge can prevent the decline of soil moisture.},

Mironov 2009 is the dielectric model used in the operational SM retrieval algorithms of the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the ESA Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) missions. However, Mironov 2009 suffers a challenge in deriving SM over organic soils, as it does not account for the impact of soil organic matter (SOM) on the soil bulk dielectric constant. To this end, we presented a comparative performance analysis of nine advanced soil dielectric models over organic soil in Alaska, four of which incorporate SOM. In the framework of the SMAP single-channel algorithm at vertical polarization (SCA-V), SM retrievals from different dielectric models were derived using an iterative optimization scheme. The skills of the different dielectric models over organic soils were reflected by the performance of their respective SM retrievals, which was measured by four conventional statistical metrics, calculated by comparing satellite-based SM time series with in-situ benchmarks. Overall, SM retrievals of organic-soil-based dielectric models tended to overestimate, while those from mineral-soil-based models displayed dry biases. All the models showed comparable values of unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) and Pearson Correlation (R), but Mironov 2019 exhibited a slight but consistent edge over the others. An integrated consideration of the model inputs, the physical basis, and the validated accuracy indicated that the separate use of Mironov 2009 and Mironov 2019 in the SMAP SCA-V for mineral soils (SOM {\textless}15\%) and organic soils (SOM {\textgreater}= 15\%) would be the preferred option.},

In this study, we try to predict field scale SWC using the CRNS combined with the temporal stability analysis in a karst watershed. The CRNS was installed in a karst watershed as well as capacitance-based SWC sensors located in five land uses. The CRNS was calibrated by eighteen manual sampling procedures. A weather station was established about 200 m away from the CRNS for monitoring basic meteorological variables. The mean footprint radius and effective depth of the CRNS were 311.51 m and 11.98 cm, respectively. The CRNS can accurately estimate intermediate scale soil moisture, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.89. Significant correlations (P {\textless} 0.01) were observed between SWC measured by the CRNS and Em-50 instruments. Though the SWC derived from the CRNS was significantly lower than that from Em-50 instruments in different land uses, the SWCs at field scale can be predicted accurately. The influences of landforms and land uses on prediction accuracy were not obvious from our data. The CRNS has great potential to improve water resources management in areas with greater heterogeneity.},

	abstract = {The global trend of vegetation “greening” in the context of ecological restoration necessitates an urgent assessment of ecosystem services. As essential components of ecosystem services, the hydraulic functions of soil in infiltrating and retaining water following vegetation restoration remain unclear, especially in subtropical mountainous and hilly areas with complex topographies. From 2018 to 2021, soil moisture data collected at five-minute intervals were monitored for three restoration strategies in a hilly catchment of China's Three Gorges Reservoir area. The restoration strategies included planted forest (PF) and natural restoration (naturally regenerated forest, NF; deforested pasture, DP). The soil moisture response to rainfall under these strategies was evaluated using several metrics, including the time difference between peak rainfall intensity and peak soil moisture response (T-p2p), cumulative infiltration, and occurrence frequency of preferential flow (PRF). The results showed that the average soil moisture content (SMC) of PF was significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) lower than that of NF and DP in both dry and wet seasons, regardless of upslope or downslope location. However, the topographic position affected the difference in average SMC between DP and NF. At the downslope location, the average SMC of DP (0.39 cm(3) cm(-3)) was significantly higher than that of NF (0.33 cm(3) cm(-3)). Conversely, at the upslope location, the average SMC of DP (0.27 cm(3) cm(-3)) was lower than that of NF (0.30 cm(3) cm(-3)). These findings suggested that PF had a lower amount of soil water storage than NF and DP, which was supported by the lowest cumulative infiltration in PF during storm events. The response of soil moisture to storms in PF (T-p2p = 3.1 h) was slower than that in NF (T-p2p = 1.9 h) and DP (T-p2p = 2.5 h). This was consistent with the lower occurrence frequency of preferential flow in PF (PRF = 19.2 \%) than NF (PRF = 39.2 \%) and DP (PRF = 32.9 \%). Therefore, longer response time and less preferential flow indicated that the PF had a relatively poor soil moisture responsiveness to storm events. Accordingly, this study highlights the insufficiency of afforestation in soil water infiltration and retention compared to natural restoration, meriting consideration when assessing soil hydraulic functions in vegetation restoration areas.},

Over time, regional or global SM and FT datasets with different spatial resolutions have been developed. In response to the requirements of multiscale product validation and multisource uncertainty tracking, a soil moisture and soil temperature (ST) monitoring network in the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB-NET) was established in September 2019. The QLB-NET is characterized by densely distributed in situ sites (82 sites) measuring SM and ST at 5-, 10-, and 30 -cm depths, with 60 sites in a large-scale network covering an area of 36 km x 40 km and 22 sites evenly distributed across two small-scale 1 km x 1 km networks. Quantitative analyses of the in situ measurements show that the QLB-NET can provide stable and reliable ground truth for SM and FT over coarse grid scales, e.g., 36 km x 36 km, 25 km x 25 km, and 0.25 degrees x 0.25 degrees. When statistics are correspondingly performed over 50 out of 54, 25 out of 29, and 25 out of 28 sites, the results are described as follows: 1) the standard deviation of the mean SM varies between 0.0127 and 0.0196 m3 m-3, with the corresponding difference between the upper and lower quartiles being less than 0.02 m3 m-3; 2) the ground freeze-thaw state can be correctly identified with high probabilities ranging from 85.3\% to 100\% on two freeze-thaw transitional dates. The QLB-NET observed datasets are distributed online and will be continuously updated through cooperation with the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn), facilitating product validation and uncertainty tracking, spatiotemporal analysis of SM change and FT transition, optimization of the SM and FT retrieving algorithms and scaling methods, and development of the mountainous microwave radiative transfer model.},

Its most vital issue is the determination of the boundary i.e. dry and wet edges. Visual interpretation and automatic fitting methods are very demanding for the research area. In contrast, theoretical calculation of the boundary has great application potential, where the traditional Priestley-Taylor (PT) equation has been introduced to derive a Sun2016 method. Recently, a new Priestly-Taylor equation was suggested. In order to furtherly improve the optical \& thermal remote sensing of SM, we evaluated the new PT equation for boundary determination through deriving a Sun 2021 method. The evaluation was conducted using data from three aircraft experiments for SM observation i.e. SMAPVEX12, SMAPVEX16 in Iowa, and SMAPVEX16 in Manitoba. Simulated data with the Simsphere model was also used. Results demonstrated that the effects of the new PT equation are related to air temperature (Ta). For a certain range of Ta such as from 290K to 310K, the Sun 2021 method is close to the Sun2016 method, which implies limited influence of the new PT equation within that range. For Ta out of that range, the Sun 2021 method presented better performance than the Sun2016, which implies stronger suitability of the new PT equation. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the new PT equation increases the sensitivity of calculated wet edge to Ta while decreases its sensitivity to the other input variables. For future extensive application, we also explored convenient ways for determining some essential parameters in the Sun 2021 method. The new PT equation has potential to promote the optical \& thermal remote sensing of SM, evapotranspiration, drought, etc.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) and land surface temperature (LST) are entangled, and the retrieval of one of them requires a priori specification of the other one. Due to insufficient observational information, retrieval of LST and SM from passive microwave remote sensing data is often ill-posed, and the retrieval accuracy needs to be improved. In this study, a novel fully-coupled paradigm is developed to robustly retrieve SM and LST from passive microwave data, which integrates deep learning, physical methods, and statistical methods. The key condition of the general paradigm proposed by us is that the output parameters of deep learning can be uniquely determined by the input parameters theoretically through a certain mathematical equation. Firstly, the physical method is deduced based on the energy radiation balance equation. The nine unknowns require the brightness temperatures of nine channels to construct nine equations, and the solutions of the physical method equations are obtained by model simulation. Based on the derivation of the physical method, the solution of the statistical method is constructed using multi-source data. Secondly, the solutions of physical and statistical methods constitute the training and test data of deep learning, which is used to obtain the solution curve of physical and statistical methods. The retrieval accuracy of LST and SM is greatly improved by smartly utilizing the mutual prior knowledge of SM and LST and cross iterative optimization calculations. Finally, validation indicates that the mean absolute error of the retrieved SM and LST data are 0.027 m(3)/m(3) and 1.38 K, respectively, at an incidence angle of 0-65 degrees. A model-data-knowledge-driven and deep learning method can overcome the shortcomings of traditional methods and provide a paradigm for retrieval of other geophysical variables. The proposed paradigm not only has physical meaning, but also makes deep learning physically interpretable, which is a milestone in the retrieval of geophysical remote sensing parameters based on artificial intelligence technology.},

In fact, explicit information on the spatial occurrence of irrigation and on the amounts of water used for this purpose is often not available, thus making irrigation the missing variable to comprehensively understand the hydrological cycle dynamics over agricultural areas. Nevertheless, remote sensing techniques can be used to delimit the irrigation extent. In this study, the capability of five remotely sensed soil moisture products to detect the irrigation signal over an area intensely equipped for irrigation in the North East of Spain is investigated; moreover, a method to map the actually irrigated areas based on the K-means clustering algorithm is proposed. The remote sensing soil moisture data sets used in this study are SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) at 1 km, SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) at 1 km and 9 km, Sentinel-1 at 1 km, and ASCAT (Advanced SCATterometer) at 12.5 km. The 1 km resolution versions of SMOS and SMAP are obtained by downscaling coarser SMOS and SMAP data through the DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) algorithm. The analyses are supported by an additional data set of soil moisture at 1 km resolution simulated by the SURFEX-ISBA (SURFace EXternalisee - Interaction Sol Biosphere Atmosphere) land surface model. Among all the considered data sets, the L-band passive microwave downscaled products show the best performances in detecting the irrigation signal over the pilot area, especially SMAP at 1 km. The proposed maps of irrigated areas derived by exploiting soil moisture from SMAP at 1 km data set agree well (up to 78\%) with the ground truth derived irrigated areas. Furthermore, the method is able to well distinguish the actually irrigated areas from rainfed agricultural areas, thus representing a useful tool to obtain reliable spatial information about the areas where irrigation actually occurs.},

	abstract = {The interaction between soil moisture (SM) and vegetation dynamics has been proven in previous studies. In situ measurements have provided reliable data to investigate and validate the time effect in different zones, which is important in the hydrology and agriculture fields. There were 845 SM in situ monitoring measurements utilized with the correlation between SM and vegetation across various soil depths and climate zones in China. The impact of climate and teleconnection factors on SM and the leaf area index (LAI) are also discussed. The results indicate that SM increases from northwest to southeast in China. The time lag responses of SM to temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and sunshine duration are 0-3 days, 3-7 days, 1-3 days, and 3-15 days, respectively. The LAI is most strongly correlated with the climate of the current month. When the LAI leads SM, a negative correlation is observed, whereas a positive correlation is observed when SM leads the LAI. This proves that vegetation growth restricts the increase in SM, and soil drying further restricts the growth of vegetation. There was a response time of 2-4 months between the LAI and SM. The effect of vegetation and deeper SM was significant in the arid zone, while they were coupled with shallow SM in the humid zone. Additionally, the El Ni \& ntilde;o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) showed a significant positive correlation with SM in 2015-2016 with signals of 9-14 months. The results provide support for balancing the contradiction between future vegetation restoration and water resource scarcity.},

Reduction of soil water content under the pavement can minimize pavement distresses. So far, there have been limited use and verification of the wicking geotextile in reducing water content of soil under concrete pavements in the field. In this field study, moisture sensors were installed in three test sections under a newly-built concrete pavement during its re-construction. The base course in one test section had a higher percentage of small particles than those in other two sections. The wicking geotextile was used between the base course and the subgrade in two test sections while a nonwoven geotextile was used in one test section. All test sections were subjected to precipitations and temperature variations. Field monitoring data showed that the wicking geotextile reduced the volumetric water content (VWC) of an aggregate base more than the nonwoven geotextile and its wicking ability decreased as the content of small particles increased. In addition, the wicking ability of the wicking geotextile decreased as the temperature decreased due to the reduction in the evaporation rate and the increase in the water retention capacity of the soil at low temperatures.},

In this paper, a measurement method based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and reflectance spectrum is proposed to realize the extraction of characteristic bands and the prediction of soil nutrients. Firstly, a series of alternative bands are obtained by mathematical transformations and correlation analysis from the reflectance spectral curves of 30 soil samples. Then, to objectively reflect different dependencies of spectral bands on the soil nutrients, AHP is adopted for weight analysis, and the particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) algorithm is used to correct the expert scoring matrix. Via the weight allocation, weight normalization and weight threshold, the alternative bands meeting the sum threshold of weights {\textgreater} 0.5 are finally selected as the characteristic bands of soil nutrients, which are at 484 nm, 512 nm, and 760 nm for total nitrogen (TN), and at 384 nm, 736 nm, and 748 nm for available phosphorus (AP). Finally, three inversion models established by the characteristic bands are used to predict soil nutrient contents, which demonstrated the feasibility of the analytic hierarchy process for the extraction of characteristic bands and the prediction of soil nutrients.},

The soil's bacterial and archaeal communities were sequenced (Illumina GAIIx, 12 replicates for treatment) and correlated with eight different soil features. The microbial community composition differed widely between planting treatments, with three primary “community types” emerging in multivariate space: (1) A community type associated with bare soil linked with low P, low pH, and high aluminum [Al]; (2) a community type associated with Lablab beans linked with high soil N, total organic carbon and other base cation concentrations, and high pH; and (3) a community type of all other non-lablab planting arrangements linked with higher soil P (relative to bare soil), but lower soil fertility (N and base cations). Lablab-based arrangements also expressed the highest microbial richness and alpha diversity. The inclusion of Lablab in maize-based cropping systems represents a potential alternative to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers and increase the chemical and biological quality in agricultural soils under the no-tillage system.},

Results demonstrated that signal power-ratio-based QZSS signals can be used to retrieve soil moisture under bare soil conditions. Moreover, for signal power-ratio-based case, results from geostationary orbit (GEO) satellite signals (STD: 0.013 and 0.007 m(3)/m(3)) performed better than those from inclined geasynchronous orbit (IGSO) satellite signals (STD: 0.033-0.071 m(3)/m(3)).},

	abstract = {The stability of soybean yields in Brazil is regularly affected by drought periods, and soil management practices are crucial to expanding the water holding capacity of the soil and providing higher levels of moisture during critical periods, which contribute to increasing crop yields, relieving the need for non-agricultural areas to be converted into croplands. The research reported herein aimed to quantitatively monitor the soil moisture of a soybean crop through leaf-based hyperspectral reflectance and suggest a remote sensing-based approach that might assist in identifying soil management zones. A field experiment at the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation during 2016/2017, 2017/2018, and 2018/2019 cropping seasons had ten soybean genotypes sub-jected to four water conditions: irrigated, non-irrigated, and water deficit induced at the vegetative or repro-ductive stages. The soil of the experimental site is characterized as Udox Oxisol. Leaf reflectance (400-2500 nm) was collected by the spectroradiometer FieldSpec 3 Jr simultaneously with soil moisture (0-20 and 20-40 cm depths) at eleven dates. Data submitted to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) evaluated the clustering of water conditions and which are the most critical spectral wavelengths to characterize the plant water status. The Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) was applied to develop a quantitative spectral model to predict soil moisture. The PCA explained over 93\% of the spectral variance within each assessment day, and shortwave infrared wavelengths presented a higher contribution to water status clustering. At the cross-validation step, the PLSR presented R2 up to 0.860 and 0.906 (0-20 and 20-40 cm) underperforming when soil moisture showed no significant differences between water conditions. Using samples from all assessment days, PLSR presented R2 = 0.609 and 0.722 (0-20 and 20-40 cm) at the external validation step (RMSE = 2.7 and 1.9, respectively), with a soil moisture range equal to 16-35\% and 20-35\% at both depths, remarkably outperforming the traditional univariate spectral models. Our results contribute to soil moisture assessment in extensive soybean areas regardless of the stage of crop development and provide a significant contribution since the Brazilian soybean crop calendar might present differences of over 30 days within the same production region. Due to that, soybean plants are rarely at the same phenological stage on a given date in the season.},

In this study, high-spectral technology was employed to collect both SMC data at different soil depths during the bolting stage of winter oilseed rape (Brassica napus L.) and corresponding hyperspectral data through two consecutive years of field experiments (2021-2022). Two categories of spectral parameters were established, including “three-edge” spectral parameters such as blue, yellow, and red edge areas, as well as empirical vegetation indices that showed strong correlations with previous research and crop parameters. The spectral parameters with the highest correlation coefficients with SMC at various soil depths were selected. Subsequently, the selected vegetation indices were utilized as inputs for modeling. Support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), back propagation neural network (BPNN), and extreme learning machine (ELM) were employed to construct SMC estimation models for different soil depths during the jointing stage of winter oilseed rape. The results indicated that the majority of the three-edge parameters and empirical vegetation indices displayed higher correlation coefficients with SMC in the 0-20 cm soil depth compared to the 20-40 cm and 40-60 cm depths. The RF model proved to be the optimal modeling method for SMC estimation, particularly for the 0-20 cm soil depth. The validation set of the estimation model for this depth achieved a high coefficient of determination (R-2) of 0.944, a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.005, and a mean relative error (MRE) of 3.074\%. The findings of this study provide a basis for high-spectral monitoring of SMC in the root zone of winter oilseed rape, offering valuable insights for the rapid assessment of crop growth under water stress conditions.},

	abstract = {Knowledge about soil moisture is important for event-based rainfall-runoff models but monitoring conditions at the catchment scale is not a trivial task. Soil moisture is highly variable in space and time, particularly in dry climates with seasonal and spatially heterogeneous rainfall. Point measurements are difficult to upscale, and remotely sensed (RS) data often lack in spatial or temporal resolution for local or regional studies. Longer latency periods - the time required before data becomes available - of some RS data make them less applicable to time-sensitive analyses such as flash flood forecasting. This study evaluated a novel approach for estimating catchment-scale volumetric soil moisture using an antecedent precipitation index (API) -based model. The model was trained and tested using in-situ soil moisture measurements collected during a 3-month field sampling campaign in a 142 km(2) study area in central New Mexico. The calibrated model was applied at the catchment scale to produce soil moisture grids from radar-derived rainfall estimates. Model performance, resolution and latency were compared to satellite-based soil moisture estimates. Benefits of the proposed new method include high spatial resolution (1 x 1 km or less depending on the precipitation data source) and high prediction accuracy (root mean square errors 0.014-0.018 m(3)/m(3)). Given the short latency period for radar-derived rainfall data, the method has potential for use in operational flood risk assessment and forecasting.},

The present study explores for the first time the combined use of UAVs with a newly proposed technique for estimating evaporative fraction (EF) and surface soil moisture (SSM). The investigation is performed in a typical Mediterranean setting, a citrus field with flat topography divided in two plots with different irrigation schemes, in Sicily, Italy, at which ground data acquired during an extensive field campaign in July 2019. Reasonable estimates of both EF and surface wetness were produced, with patterns in agreement to vegetation cover fragmentation, topography, and other site-specific characteristics. Validation shows average error of 0.053 for EF and of 0.040 cm(3) cm(-3) for SSM. The results are comparable or better to those reported in analogous studies performed in similar areas. This implies that the investigated approach performs well under the semi-arid conditions characterizing the experimental set up. To our knowledge, this study represents the first evaluation of the combined use of the `simplified triangle' with very high-resolution UAV imagery. As such, the findings are of significance regarding the potential future use of the `simplified triangle' approach particularly with very fine resolution imagery such as that provided by UAV for mapping and monitoring EF and SSM in agricultural and natural ecosystems.},

Two GloFAS experiments were performed, one which used hydro-meteorological forcings produced with the assimilation of the SMOS data, the other using forcings which excluded the assimilation of the SMOS data. Both sets of experiment results were verified against streamflow observations in the United States and Australia. Skill scores were computed for each experiment against the observation datasets, the differences in the skill scores were used to identify where GloFAS skill may be affected by the assimilation of SMOS soil moisture data. In addition, a global assessment was made of the impact upon the 5th and 95th GloFAS flow percentiles to see how SMOS data assimilation affected low and high flows respectively. Results against in-situ observations found that GloFAS skill score was only affected by a small amount. At a global scale, the results showed a large impact on high flows in areas such as the Hudson Bay, central United States, the Sahel and Australia. There was no clear spatial trend to these differences as opposing signs occurred within close proximity to each other. Investigating the differences between the simulations at individual gauging stations showed that they often only occurred during a single flood event; for the remainder of the simulation period the experiments were almost identical. This suggests that SMOS data assimilation may affect the generation of surface runoff during high flow events, but may have less impact on baseflow generation during the remainder of the hydrograph. To further understand this, future work could assess the impact of SMOS data assimilation upon specific hydrological components such as surface and subsurface runoff.},

Nitrogen based fertilizer (ammonium sulphate) was applied at 120 kg/ha to its corresponding treatment, and maize mulch was applied as full coverage (24 t/ha). A 4 x 3 x 2 completely randomized block design with 4 treatments: mulch, fertilizer, tillage and no-tillage was tested at 2 levels and replicated 3 times in the trials. Results showed that fertilizer was the most important factor in maize production; maize treated with fertilizer, by itself or in combination with other treatments, gave the highest yield. Tillage was seen to increase bulk density, while mulch was observed to limit loss of soil organic carbon, and potassium. Addition of fertilizer was found to be the cause in reducing pH. The combination of tillage-mulch-fertilizer was expected to be high yielding; however it was observed that potassium was the limiting factor that induced a reduction in overall yield.},

In the third experiment, 1 350 kg ha-1 of the residual film with different side lengths (2-5, 5-10, 10-15, and 15-20 cm) was added to field soil for six years to explore the effect of residual film fragment size on soil nutrients, soil microorganisms, crop growth and yields. The residual film had little effect on the soil moisture at a field depth of 0-2 (or 0-1.8) m. There were no significant effects on organic carbon, total nitrogen, inorganic nitrogen, total phosphorus or available phosphorus in the 0-20 cm soil layer. The presence of residual film decreased the richness and diversity of the bacterial community of the surface soil of the residual film, but it had no significant effect on the microbial community of the non-surface soil. The emergence rates of wheat and lentils occasionally decreased significantly with different amounts of residue fragments added to the field. At 450-2 700 kg ha-1, the residual film reduced the plant height and stem diameter of maize and significantly reduced the shoot biomass of harvested maize by 11-19\%. The average yields of maize and potato over the seven years decreased, but there were almost no significant statistical differences among the treatments.

However, plantation vegetables usually require a large input of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in a greenhouse setting, which will lower the soil quality and accelerate the emission of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the purpose of this research was to explore planting lettuce under an NPI system that retrenches N fertilizer application and mitigates N2O emissions compared with conventional irrigation (CI). This research proved that under NPI conditions, nitrate and ammonium fluctuated slightly in the soil, stabilizing in the range of 18-28 mg kg(-1), while that of CI was 20-55 mg kg(-1). The NPI alleviated N2O emissions, and NPI-N150 and NPI-N105 decreased them by 18\% and 32\%, respectively, compared with those for CI-N150. The main explanation was that the NPI inhibited the formation of NO3–N, reduced the copies number of AOA and AOB as well as the abundance of Nitrospira in the soil, and weakened the soil nitrate reductase and urease activities. The results of this research provide a reliable scientific method for reducing the use of water and N fertilizer while cultivating lettuce, as well as for reducing N2O emissions from agricultural facilities.},

The hyperspectral data from indoor and Zhuhai-1 remote sensing imagery were resampled to the same spectral scale. The soil hyperspectral data were processed by fractional order differential preprocessing method and optimized spectral indices method, and the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC/r) analysis was made with SMC data. The sensitive optimized spectral indices were used to establish the ground hyperspectral estimation model, and a variety of modeling methods were used to select the best SMC inversion model. The results were as follows: the maximum one-dimensional r between SMC and the 466-938 nm band was -0.635, the maximum one-dimensional r with the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum was 0.665, and the maximum two-dimensional r with the difference index (DI) calculated by the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum was +/- 0.72. The maximum three-dimensional r with the triangle vegetation index (TVI) calculated from the 0.5-order absorbance spectrum reached 0.755, which exceeded the one-dimensional r extreme value of 400-2400 nm. The TreeNet gradient boosting machine (TGBM) regression model had the highest modeling accuracy, with a calibration coefficient of determination (R-C(2)) = 0.887, calibration root mean square error (RMSEC) = 2.488\%, standard deviation (SD) = 6.733\%, and r = 0.942. However, the partial least squares regression (PLSR) model had the strongest predictive ability, with validation coefficient of determination (R-V(2)) = 0.787, validation root mean square error (RMSEV) = 3.247\%, and relative prediction deviation (RPD) = 2.071. The variable importance in projection (VIP) method could not only improve model efficiency but also increased model accuracy. R-C(2) of the optimal PLSR model was 0.733, RMSEC was 3.028\%, R-V(2) was 0.805, RMSEV was 3.100\%, RPD was 1.976, and Akaike information criterion (AIC) was 151.050. The three-band optimized spectral indices with fractional differential pretreatment could to a certain extent break through the limitation of visible near-infrared spectrum in SMC estimation due to the lack of shortwave infrared spectra, which made it possible to quantitatively retrieve saline SMC on the basis of Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) plays a critical role in vegetation growth, terrestrial hydrological cycle, and regional climate change. In this article, the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) SM was validated at multiscale and multidepth against in situ measurements over the Tibetan plateau, and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) SM was also used as a reference for the validation process. The results revealed the following: First, in validations using the large, medium, and small scale networks, the small network achieved comparatively superior accuracy with a higher fitting degree and smaller statistical error, proving the reliability and robustness of densely clustered in situ stations. Second, the CLDAS SM can correctly present the promotion effect from precipitation. The most significant response of the CLDAS SM to precipitation lagged from 1 to 3 days in terms of growing depth, whereas promotion to SM tended to decrease as the soil depth increased. Third, CLDAS and GLDAS reasonably fitted in situ measurements in the frozen and unfrozen seasons, while their bias gradually increased with increasing depth. The SM errors in the snow-covered region were relatively stable. Diurnal land surface temperature exhibited a positive correlation with the bias of top-layer SM. In summary, this article shows that CLDAS SM retrievals favorably reproduced values and dynamics of in situ measurements and can be expected to act as a valuable reference for water cycle studies and climate evolution analysis.},

	abstract = {Non-invasive techniques are essential to deepen our understanding of root-soil interactions in situ. Neutron computed tomography (NCT) is an example of such techniques that have been successfully used to study these interactions in high resolution. Many of the studies using NCT however, have invariably focused on lupine plants and thus there is limited information available on other more commercially important staple crop plants such as wheat and rice. Also considering the high neutron sensitivity to hydrogen (e.g. water in roots or soil organic matter), nearly all previous in-situ NCT studies have used a relatively homogeneous porous media such as sand, low in soil organic matter and free from soil aggregates, to obtain high-quality images. However to expand the scope of the use of NCT to other more commercially important crops and in less homogenous soils, in this study we focused on wheat root growth in a soil that contained a considerable amount of soil organic matter (SOM) and different sized aggregates. As such, the main aims of this research were (1) to unravel wheat (Triticum aestivum cv. Fielder) root system architecture (RSA) when grown in an aggregated sandy loam soil ({\textless} 4 mm) with 4\% SOM content, (2) Map in 3D, soil water distribution after a brief drying period and (3) to understand how the root system interacts with soil moisture distribution brought about by soil structural heterogeneity. To achieve these, wheat seedlings were grown for 13-days in aluminium tubes (100 mm height and 18 mm diameter) packed with soil and imaged for the first time at the IMAT neutron beamline (in the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, UK). To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first study to use NCT to study wheat root architectural development. Our study proved that NCT can successfully be used to reveal wheat RSA in a heterogeneous aggregated soils with moderate amounts of SOM. Lateral root growth within the soil column was increased in regions with increased finer soil separates. NCT was also able to successfully map water distribution in a 3D and we show that large macro-aggregates preferentially retained relatively higher soil moisture in comparison to the smaller soil separates within our samples (Fig. 1). This highlights the importance large macro aggregates in sustainable soil management as they may be able to provide plants water during periodic dry spells. More in situ investigations are required to further understand the impact of different aggregate sizes on RSA and water uptake.},

	abstract = {Reduced nutrient mineralization rates under minimum tillage are usually compensated by mineral fertilizer application. These, however, cannot be applied in organic farming systems. We hypothesized that an organic minimum tillage system based on frequent cover cropping and application of dead mulch would improve soil fertility and compensate for the potential negative effects of minimum tillage. Two long-term field experiments were set up in 2010 and 2011 to compare plowing versus minimum tillage including the application of transferred mulch. A second factor, the application of compost versus mineral potassium and phosphorus, was also compared. In 2019, soils were analyzed for soil pH, organic carbon, macro- and micronutrients, microbial biomass, microbial activity, and total nematode abundance. In addition, performance of pea in the same soils was determined under greenhouse conditions. Across both experiments, macronutrients (+52\%), micronutrients (+11\%), microbial biomass (+51\%), microbial activity (+86\%), and bacterivorous nematodes (+112\%) increased in minimum tillage compared to the plow-based system. In the greenhouse, pea biomass was 45\% higher in the soil that had been subjected to minimum tillage compared to the plow. In conclusion, soil fertility can be improved in organic minimum tillage systems, which include intensive cover cropping and the application of dead mulch, over plow-based systems.},

	abstract = {Few studies have quantified soil greenhouse gas (GHG) - CH4, CO2 N2O - annual fluxes directly from smallholder maize cropping systems under different soil fertility management technologies in Sub Saharan Africa. We quantified soil GHG annual fluxes from smallholder maize cropping systems under four different soil fertility management technologies in the Central Highlands of Kenya. We regularly sampled GHG from 2nd March 2018 to 1st March 2019 (1 year) in three maize farms using a static chamber technique. The fertility management technologies were: inorganic fertilizer, animal manure, animal manure combined with inorganic fertilizer, and a Control (No external input). The experimental design was a randomized complete block design replicated thrice. Cumulative annual soil fluxes ranged from -2.40 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to -1.62 kg CH4-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the manure combined with inorganic fertilizer treatment, 4810 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to 6576 kg CO2-C ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic fertilizer treatment, and 0.21 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the control treatment to 0.38 kg N2O-N ha(-1) yr(-1) from the inorganic fertilizer treatment for CH4, CO2, and N2O fluxes, respectively. Fertilizer treatment produced the highest CO2 emissions (p {\textless} 0.001), N2O emissions (P {\textless} 0.001), and yield-scaled N2O emissions (YSE), (0.028 g N2O-N kg(-1) grain yield). A combination of manure and inorganic fertilizer produced the highest CH4 fluxes (p = 0.035) across treatments. We concluded that a judicious combination of organic resources (animal manure) and inorganic resources (fertilizer) has the potential to enhance food security while mitigating soil greenhouse gas emissions in SSA.},

	abstract = {Satellite-derived soil moisture (SM) observations are widely assimilated in global land data assimilation systems. These systems typically assume zero-mean errors in the land surface model and observations. In practice, systematic differences (biases) exist between the observed and modelled SM. Commonly, the observed SM biases are removed by rescaling techniques or via a machine learning approach. However, these methods do not account for non-stationary biases, which can result from issues with the satellite retrieval algorithms or changes in the land surface model. Therefore, we test a novel application of adaptive SM bias correction (BC) in the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) land data assimilation system. A two-stage filter is formulated to dynamically correct biases from satellite-derived active ASCAT C-band and passive L-band SMOS surface SM observations. This complements the operational seasonal rescaling of the ASCAT observations and the SMOS neural network retrieval while allowing the assimilation to correct subseasonal-scale errors. Experiments are performed on the ECMWF stand-alone surface analysis, which is a simplified version of the integrated forecasting system. Over a 3 year test period, the adaptive BC reduces the seasonal-scale (observation-forecast) departures by up to 20\% (30\%) for the ASCAT (SMOS). The adaptive BC leads to (1) slight improvements in the SM analysis performance and (2) moderate but statistically significant reductions in the 1-5 day relative humidity forecast errors in the boundary layer of the Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes. Future work will test the adaptive SM BC in the full integrated forecasting system.},

However, due to complex interactions among ICLF components, we are still lacking evidence about the system's resilience regarding water availability, especially for regions characterized by pronounced wet and dry seasons and frequent droughts. For a mature ICLF system in the Cerrado biome of central-west Brazil comprising rows of eucalyptus trees (Eucalyptus grandis x Eucalyptus urophylla, H13 clone) at a spacing of 22 m in combination with Brachiaria brizantha cv. BRS Plata pasture we continuously measured soil moisture (SM) until 1 m depth and supported this data with measurements of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) and above ground green grass biomass (AGBM) across transects between the tree rows for almost two years. Across the seasons a distinct gradient was observed with SM being lower close to the tree rows than in the space between them. During winter SM decreased to critical values near the tree lines in the topsoil. During spring and summer, incident PAR was 72\% and 86\% lower close to the trees than at the center point. For autumn and winter PAR was more evenly distributed between the tree rows due to inclination with notably up to four times more radiation input near the tree lines compared to spring and summer. AGBM showed a clear distribution with maximum values in the center and about half of the biomass close to the tree rows. Our data suggest that, restrictions in AGBM accumulation shifted among seasons between water limitations in winter and light limitations during summer. Interestingly, SM changes during wetting and drying events were most pronounced in subsoils near the tree rows, while the topsoil showed much less fluctuations. The subsoil in central position showed the lowest SM dynamics in response to drought maintaining a relative high and constant SM content, therefore functioning as important water reservoirs likely improving the resilience of the system to drought stress. Results of this study could help to improve management and the design of ICLF systems in view of sustainability and resistance to (water) crises but should be further supported by in depth analysis of soil water dynamics as affected by climate gradients, soil types and different management practices.},

In the present study, a new approach was adopted to estimate surface soil moisture based on multi-index models using reflective and thermal indices as well as surface energy balance system-Iran (SEBS-Iran) in pastures and farmlands in Qom province, Iran in 2016-2017. To select the best model based on remote sensing (RS) indices, 12 models were designed and after analysis, the best ones were selected. Afterward, the results of the SEBS-Iran algorithm and the improved multi-index model [normalized multi-band drought index (NMDI), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST) and the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI)] were calibrated with field data in the two studied fields (pastures and farmlands). The findings indicated that the multi-index model NMDI-TDVI-LST-NDVI (R = 0.95) and SEBS-Iran (R = 0.93) both had significant correlations with measured soil moisture. Regarding both models in farmlands and pastures, the SEBS-Iran regression model was closer to the line of fit, andR(2)in the two fields was 0.95 and 0.96, respectively. Compared to SEBS-Iran, the multi-index model showed lower coefficient of determination in pastures (0.71) due to the higher accuracy of SEBS-Iran in areas with lower vegetation density. Generally, both methods were found to be suitable for soil moisture estimation. The multi-index model can be used to estimate soil moisture in densely vegetated areas on a large scale due to its simplicity and good accuracy. Moreover, the highly accurate SEBS-Iran model can be used even in sparsely vegetated areas.},

	abstract = {To promote the environmental sustainability of rural sanitation, a soil moisture controlled wastewater subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) dispersal system was field tested in the Black Belt Prairie of Alabama, USA. The soil moisture control strategy was designed to regulate wastewater disposal timing according to drain field conditions to prevent hydraulic overloading and corresponding environmental hazard. CW2D/HYDRUS simulation modeling was utilized to explore difficult-to-measure aspects of system performance. While the control system successfully adapted hydraulic loading rate to changing drain field conditions, saturated field conditions during the dormant season presented practical application challenges. The paired field experiment and simulation model demonstrate that soil biofilm growth was stimulated in the vicinity of drip emitters. Although biofilm growth is critical in maintaining adequate COD and NH4+-N removal efficiencies, the efficient removal of biodegradable COD itself by soil biofilm limits denitrification of formed NO3- - N. Furthermore, stimulated soil biofilm growth can create soil clogging around drip emitters, which was discerned in the field experiment along with salt accumulation, both of which were verified by simulation. Comparable modeling of system performance in sand and clay media demonstrate that the placement of soil moisture sensors within the drain field can have pronounced impacts on system hydraulic performance, depending on the soil permeability. Overall, the soil moisture control strategy tested is shown as a viable supplemental technology to promote the environmental sustainability of rural sanitation systems. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a key state variable in terrestrial systems because it controls the exchange of water and energy between the continental surface and the atmosphere. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) technology is widely used for the analysis of porous media in SM due to its unique sensitivity to hydrogen protons. Unlike traditional laboratory NMR systems, unilateral NMR (UNMR) systems allow for the placement of detection targets outside the sensor space, thereby enabling in situ detection capabilities. However, in the existing designs of UNMR sensors, the magnetic field location is typically determined after the sensor has been designed. In this study, a novel UNMR sensor design scheme is proposed based on a simplified analytical model (SAM) to solve this problem. In contrast to conventional practices, this scheme places a primary emphasis on the identification of detection positions as its initial step, followed by the computation of magnet structure parameters. Concurrently, the mechanical design of the proposed UNMR sensor offers a more adaptable approach to regulation. The scheme consists of two components: magnetic field calculation and optimization of structural parameters. Notably, the proposed model exhibits a remarkable enhancement in calculation efficiency, surpassing the baseline by more than 70 times within a single iteration, compared with the traditional analytical model (TAM). The goodness of fit between the measured magnetic field distribution and the optimized results surpasses 0.99, thereby providing additional evidence of the sensor's effectiveness. In addition, the sensor's performance is demonstrated through measurements conducted on samples with varying SM content.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture has been considered a key variable in governing the terrestrial ecosystem. However, it is challenging to preserve indigenous soil characteristics using conventional soil moisture monitoring methods that require maximum soil contacts. To overcome this issue, we developed a non-destructive method of evaluating soil moisture using a contactless ultrasonic system. This system was designed to measure leaky Rayleigh waves at the air-soil joint-half space. The influences of soil moisture on leaky Rayleigh waves were explored under sand, silt, and clay in a controlled experimental design. Our results showed that there were strong relationships between the energy and amplitude of leaky Rayleigh waves and soil moisture for all three soil cases. These results can be explained by reduced soil strengths during evaporation processes for coarse soil particles as opposed to fine soil particles. To evaluate soil moisture based on the dynamic parameters and wave properties obtained from the observed leaky Rayleigh waves, we used the random forest model. The accuracy of predicted soil moisture was exceptional for test data sets under all soil types (R-2 {\textgreater}= 0.98, RMSE {\textless}= 0.0089 m(3) m(-3)). That is, our study demonstrated that the leaky Rayleigh waves had great potential to continuously assess soil moisture variations without soil disturbances.},

The simplified Extended Kalman Filter (sEKF) based Land Surface Data Assimilation (LSDA) system is used to create land surface soil moisture initial conditions for NCUM-R by assimilating ASCAT soil moisture (SM) along with screen level observations. Two numerical experiments, namely CTL (incorporating only screen level observations in LSDA) and ASCAT (assimilating both ASCAT SM and screen level observations in LSDA) are carried out to update the model soil moisture initial conditions. Identical atmospheric initial condition prepared considering the 4DVAR data assimilation technique is used in both experiments. The results of this study show that the assimilation of remotely sensed SM has a beneficial impact on MD simulation, its movement, structure and associated precipitation. The analysis increment of fluxes from ASCAT experiment clearly shows properly coupled positive feedback between land and atmosphere. SM in the vicinity of MD is considerably improved in the ASCAT analysis as compared to the CTL analysis and is well correlated with the observed rainfall over the regions. The root mean square error of top layer SM is decreased by 5 to 15\% in ASCAT analyses compared to CTL analyses. The land-atmosphere coupling feedback is investigated by using Dirmeyer's indices, it is noticed that the precipitation modulated by the latent heat flux is higher in ASCAT simulation than in the CTL simulation. This improvement is due to the proper representation of surface conditions by assimilating the satellite SM observations into LSDA. The contribution of individual terms of vorticity equation and total vorticity tendency is considerably well represented in ASCAT experiment as compared to the CTL experiment during the various phases of MD. Overall, this study indicates that the use of ASCAT SM in the preparation of soil moisture initial conditions helps to improve the forecast of MDs by the regional NWP system.},

We seek to improve understanding of how prolonged drought impacts seep-headwater hydrology, and to determine how well dominant vegetation reflects changes in volumetric soil moisture (theta v). Results show the entire hillslope saturates after storm events, but due to severe drought, no surface runoff or channel flow was recorded. We documented changes in soil moisture, with the highest theta v occurring along the deeper footslope soils. We hypothesize hyperseasonal environments, or seasonal waterlogging/desiccation of upland vegetation in poorly drained soils, exist in the study area and are the first to quantify hyperseasonality, or \% change in magnitude of theta v throughout a hydrologic year. The seep and riparian plots aligned with lower hyperseasonality, indicating seasonal hypoxia, but not complete desiccation. High hyperseasonality occurred along the midslope barrens, indicative of a true hyperseasonal environment. We suggest a {\textgreater}= 90\% threshold would likely indicate true hyperseasonal cyclicity of anaerobic and xeric regimes. Our results provide insight to how extreme drought impacts seep-headwater systems, and how predicted hotter, drier conditions may alter their hydrologic regime.},

Thanks to their low computational cost, these tools are becoming increasingly important to accelerate the exploration of emission scenarios and the coupling of climate information to other models. However, the emulation of regional climate extremes and water cycle variables has remained challenging. The MESMER emulator was recently expanded to represent regional temperature extremes in the new “MESMER-X” version, which is targeted at impact-related variables, including extremes. This paper presents a further expansion of MESMER-X to represent indices related to fire weather and soil moisture. Given a trajectory of global mean temperature, the extended emulator generates spatially resolved realizations for the seasonal average of the Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI), the number of days with extreme fire weather, the annual average of the soil moisture, and the annual minimum of the monthly average soil moisture. For each ESM, the emulations mimic the statistical distributions and the spatial patterns of these indicators. For each of the four variables considered, we evaluate the performances of the emulations by calculating how much their quantiles deviate from those of the ESMs. Given how it performs over a large range of annual indicators, we argue that this framework can be expanded to further variables. Overall, the now expanded MESMER-X emulator can emulate several climate variables, including climate extremes and soil moisture availability, and is a useful tool for the exploration of regional climate changes and their impacts.},

A set of 102 samples, collected from two agricultural fields, with broad ranges of fertility attributes were selected. Two contrasting data fusion approaches have been applied for modeling: (i) merging spectral data of different sensors followed by partial least squares regression (PLS), known as fusion before prediction; and (ii) applying the Granger and Ramanathan (GR) averaging approach, known as fusion after prediction. Results showed VNIR as individual technique to be the best for the prediction of clay and OM content (2.61 {\textless}= residual prediction deviation (RPD) {\textless}= 3.37), while the chemical attributes CEC, V, ex-P, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were better predicted (1.82 {\textless}= RPD {\textless}= 4.82) by elemental analysis techniques (i.e., XRF and LIBS). Only pH cannot be predicted regardless the technique. The attributes OM, V, and ex-P were best predicted using single-sensor approaches, while the attributes clay, CEC, pH, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg were overall best predicted using multi-sensor approaches. Regarding the performance of the multi-sensor approaches, ex-K, ex-Ca, and ex-Mg, were best predicted (RPD of 4.98, 5.30, and 4.11 for ex-K, ex-Ca and ex-Mg, respectively) using two-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF for ex-K and XRF + LIBS for ex-Ca and ex-Mg), while clay, CEC and pH were best predicted (RPD of 4.02, 2.63, and 1.32 for clay, CEC, and pH, respectively) with the three-sensor fusion approach (VNIR + XRF + LIBS). Therefore, the best combination of sensors for predicting key fertility attributes proved to be attribute-specific, which is a drawback of the data fusion approach.

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) exerts a significant impact on crop growth, interacting with environmental factors such as temperature, photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), and CO2, ultimately affecting crop photosynthesis (Pn). This study employs a nested experimental design to investigate the photosynthetic activity of cucumber seedlings under diverse environmental conditions and establishes a support vector regression (SVR) model for Pn prediction. The SVR model takes temperature, PPFD, SM, and CO2 concentration as inputs and demonstrates a high level of accuracy (The model's coefficient of determination = 0.9830, root mean square error = 0.9138). Subsequently, through a generalized additive model, the study unveils the significant impact of interactions between SM and PPFD on Pn. Accordingly, this research constructs a Pn response surface based on these two factors and identifies the maximum point of Gaussian curvature on this surface. Polynomial regression is applied to these points, yielding a comprehensive regulation strategy for SM and PPFD. In comparison to traditional methods based on maximizing Pn, this innovative approach reduces Pn by 12.9 \% while significantly conserving light (35.59 \%) and water (32.80 \%) consumption. Although no significant changes are observed in crop physiological traits (plant height, stem diameter, dry weight, fresh weight), substantial variations are noted in irrigation volume and PPFD consumption. Thus, the regulation strategy proposed in this study embodies efficiency and energy conservation in greenhouse crop cultivation.},

	abstract = {Due to the coarse spatial resolution of currently available microwave (mostly passive) soil moisture (SM) products, it is difficult to apply these SM data in watersheds or at local scales. `lb this end, a number of downscaling approaches have been developed to improve the spatial resolution of microwave SM products. Specifically, the optical-/thermal-based downscaling methods are most widely used in recent decades. However, such methods normally rely on instantaneous optical/thermal land surface parameters, which are commonly inapplicable under cloudy conditions. The purpose of this study is to develop a new downscaling method based on the temporal variation in geostationary satellite-derived land surface temperature and net surface shortwave radiation. The proposed method has a certain potential to improve data availability under cloudy conditions, because geostationary satellites are capable of providing land surface parameters at high temporal resolution. The proposed method was tested over the REMEDHUS network in Spain. The scaling strategy of cumulative distribution function matching was used to remove systematic differences in spatial mismatch between satellite pixels and in situ SM measurements. Results indicate that the downscaled SM agrees well with in situ measurements and has comparable accuracy with the original microwave SM product. The overall root mean square errors with the in situ measurements for the original microwave SM and the downscaled SM are 0.054 and 0.057 m(3)/m(3), respectively. This method not only has a successful attempt to downscale microwave SM data using temporal information but also has the potential to avoid the failure of traditional instantaneous observations-based downscaling procedure due to clouds.},

	abstract = {Many remote sensing soil moisture (SM) products have been developed with global coverage. However, most of them are derived from passive microwave observations with very coarse resolution, greatly constraining the applications at regional scales. To increase the spatial resolution, a downscaling method is developed to downscale the 36-km Soil Moisture Active Passive L3 SM (SMAP SM) product to 1 km using the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products (8-d land surface temperature, LST, and 16-d normalized difference vegetation index, NDVI). In this method, a linking model is first established between SM and LST and NDVI, and a self-adaptive window method is applied with the use of the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method to obtain an optimal local regression. Then, the uncertainty of the linking model, expressed as the regression residual, is redistributed to fine-resolution pixels to analyze the consistency before and after downscaling. The method was applied to the Iberian Peninsula to produce the 8-d downscaled SM product in 2016. The downscaled SM was validated with the in-situ SM network (REMEDHUS). A good agreement was found between the two data sets, with a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.87 and an unbiased root-mean-squared error (ubRMSE) of 0.043 m(3)/m(3) at a network level. At station level, the R is larger than 0.6 for all the REMEDHUS stations, with an ubRMSE smaller than 0.06 m(3)/m(3). The evaluation indicates the good potential of the proposed method in the SM downscaling, which achieves a robust consistency and provides rich spatial information while maintaining good accuracy.},

	abstract = {The Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission provided monthly global estimates of the vertically integrated terrestrial water storage with about 300-400-km horizontal resolution between 2002 and 2017. Since 2009, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission observes global L-band brightness temperatures, which are sensitive to near-surface soil moisture, with a revisit time of 1-3 days at a nominal 43-km spatial resolution. This work investigates if the multi-sensor assimilation of these observations into the Catchment land surface model can improve the estimation of 0-5 cm “surface” soil moisture, 0-100 cm “root-zone” soil moisture, and shallow (unconfined) groundwater levels. Single-sensor GRACE or SMOS assimilation and multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS assimilation experiments were performed over the continental U.S. for 6 years (July 2010 June 2016). GRACE data assimilation mostly improves estimates of shallow groundwater, whereas SMOS data assimilation mainly improves estimates of surface soil moisture. The benefits introduced by the single-sensor assimilation are merged in the multi-sensor assimilation experiment, suggesting that better and more consistent soil moisture and groundwater estimates can be achieved when multiple observation types are assimilated. Interestingly, in the multi-sensor GRACE + SMOS experiment, the water storage increments introduced by the GRACE analysis and the SMOS analysis are anti-correlated. That is, when the GRACE assimilation increments remove water from the overall profile storage, the SMOS assimilation increments add water to it, and vice versa. This anti-correlation could be caused by the SMOS analysis trying to undo the increments from the GRACE analysis.},

Using a quality control (QC) scheme based on the biweight method and a successive correction method (SCM) with different weighting functions introduced from the Cressman and/or Barnes methods, the soil moisture collected from China Land Data Assimilation System version 2.0 was taken as the background data. Two soil analysis products with induced hourly station soil observations were constructed and further compared with in situ observations and satellite products. Results show that with the biweight method, the outliers of soil moisture could be identified, and that the number of these was less than 10\% of the actual reported samples. The analysis product is more accurate with the Cressman weighting function than with the Barnes as the root mean square error was reduced by 30\% to 0.06, while the correlation coefficient increased by 73\% to 0.59, compared to the control. These results indicate that the Cressman product is a useful and promising soil moisture data set. The proposed Cressman method is computationally simple and efficient, so the product can be easily updated to keep pace with significant increases in the volume of soil moisture data. The methods used here for QC, SCM, and comparison could help evaluate and improve land surface models and their soil moisture products.},

In this paper, the goal is to demonstrate the power of a new class of methods known as the forward sensitivity method (FSM) which is based on the temporal evolution of model sensitivities with respect to the control variables consisting of initial conditions and parameters. FSM operates in two phases: the first phase provides a simple algorithm for placing observations at or near where the square of forward sensitivities attains their maximum values. Using only this selected subset of observations in a weighted least squares method, the second phase then provides an estimate of the unknown elements of the control variables. In this paper, FSM based assimilation is applied to a simple class of two parameter model in a medium-sized agriculture dominant watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. Four assimilation scenarios were tested to determine the effect of assimilating only sensitive observations as well as the impact of temporally evolving initial condition sensitivity. Sensitivity results showed that observations during the monsoon time alone are enough for assimilation purposes, which has helped in reducing the computational time greatly. Assimilation and forecast results also indicated that the scenarios which assimilated only sensitive observations are better in estimating daily streamflow. From the obtained results, it is concluded that FSM based assimilation has significant potential to improve the streamflow simulations, especially in places where data availability remains a major challenge.},

Optical remote sensing technology is one of the main parts of soil moisture estimation.

The results indicate that the soil organic matter had a significant spectral feature at wavelengths larger than 900 nm. The existence of soil organic matter would lead to darker soil, and this feature was similar to the soil moisture. Meanwhile, the effect of the soil organic matter on its reflectance overlaps with the effect of soil moisture on its reflected spectrum. This can lead to the underestimation of the soil moisture content, with an MRE of 21.87\%. To reduce this effect, the absorption of the soil organic matter was considered based on the Lambert-Beer law. Then, we established an SMCg-estimating model based on the radiative transform theory while considering the effect of the soil organic matter. The results showed that the effect of the soil organic matter can be effectively reduced and the accuracy of the soil moisture estimation was increased, while MRE decreased from 21.87\% to 6.53\%.},

	abstract = {In this study, the concept of activation soil moisture (ASM) has been conceptualised by coupling the Soil Moisture Accounting (SMA) concept with the static infiltration component (Fc) for simulating rainfall-runoff process. The ASM has been defined as the height of soil moisture barrier (or the amount of soil moisture deficit), which must be fulfilled before runoff can start. Most of the SCS-CN inspired methods, including the original one do not consider ASM in their formulation to simulate rainfall-runoff process. To account for ASM, here, we develop an activation soil moisture accounting (ASMA) based method (ASMA-SCS-CN) by coupling the SMA concept of Michel-Vazken-Perrin (MVP) method with the static infiltration (Fc) based Mishra-Singh (MS) method, which presents a fuller picture of SMA system. The performance of the ASMA-SCS-CN method is compared with the original SCS-CN method, MS method and MVP method by applying a large dataset of 56,343 storm events from 164 small to large watersheds in the United States using goodness-of-fit statistics in terms of Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), the root mean square error (RMSE), normalized RMSE (nRMSE), percent bias (PBIAS), mean absolute error (MAE), standard error (SE) and RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR). The ASMA-SCS-CN method has the highest median value of NSE (0.71; varying from 0.11 to 0.97) with interquartile range (IQR) as (0.62-0.80) followed by MVP with NSE (0.67; varying from 0.10 to 0.0.96) and IQR as (0.57-0.74), MS with NSE (0.61; varying from 0.02 to 0.97) and IQR range as (0.46-0.72), and SCS-CN with NSE (0.58; varying from 0,01 to 0.92) and IQR as (0.44-0.69). The ASMA-SCS-CN method is found to have lowest mean and median values of RMSE, nRMSE, MAE, SE and RSR than the MVP, MS and SCS-CN method. The PBIAS values of the ASMA-SCS-CN and MVP methods are lower than that of MS and SCS-CN method. In addition, the performance of all four methods is further evaluated based on the watershed characteristics such as landuse, soil type, drainage area, and mean rainfall and the results show that in all cases the ASMA-SCS-CN method performs much better than the rest of the methods. Overall, the improved performance of ASMA-SCS-CN can be attributed to the inclusion of SMA along with the static infiltration component for representing the complete picture of SMA system in modelling rainfall-runoff process.},

Due to the inhibitive cost of implementing a standard validation site, this study presents an alternative sampling approach suitable for localized validation of SMAP data in non-complex terrains. It involves clustering a large heterogeneous study area to smaller units of non-complex terrains where landscape-defining characteristics are largely homogeneous, thus permitting the computation of areal soil moisture as a simple arithmetic mean of near-linear point measurements. This allows optimization of limited resources (a hand-held moisture sensor with site-specific calibrations) to balance the need for spatial representativeness of samples in the sampling unit and the need for temporal proximity of sampled measurements to the aggregation time of the satellite product being validated. For ease of movement, transect sampling is implemented along access roads that run across the sampling units to allow sufficient measurement replications within a reasonably short time. Validations with four different landscapes in Kenya show a good agreement between in situ measurements and SMAP with R2 of 0.76, 0.72, 0.80, and 0.82, and biases of -0.0246, +0.0113, 0.0004, and + 0.0035 m3 m-3, respectively for Mawego, Kuresoi, Sotik and Kapsuser sites. These results only marginally differ from those obtained with a spatially distributed sampling method, indicating the potential of the proposed sampling design for time and cost effectiveness in validations at non-complex terrains. An analysis of the temporal variability of SMAP soil moisture in the watershed is also presented, with an assessment of its significance in the selection of sampling sites for validation. Particularly, the concept of temporal stability of soil moisture as a basis for clustering validation sites is evaluated.},

Soil electrical conductivity (EC) is related to nutrients in soil solution, which can be affected by soil organic matter, soil texture, temperature, and water content. Therefore, the objective of this study is to evaluate factors influencing soil EC sensor values by monitoring EC under different soil organic matter and water contents. Ten soil samples with various sand and clay contents, EC, pH, and organic matter contents were selected and saturated with water. Volumetric water content and EC of the soil were monitored while drying the soil. Humic acid and manure were added to soils in order to evaluate the effect of organic matter on soil EC. Soil EC values linearly increased with increasing water content at 10-25\% which is favorable water content for plant growth. The EC increased when organic matter was added to soils, which was related to ions released from the organic matter. Soil EC calibration factor for soil water content increased when EC of the soil was high and organic matter was added. The sensor EC values in sandy loam and loam soils was related to the ion contents in pore water, and exchangeable ions in soil, respectively. Sensor EC values were highly correlated with organic matter and K contents in soil and can be used as an indicator for plant available nutrients in soil. Therefore, the sensor EC at optimal soil water content for plant growth can be used to monitor changes in plant available nutrients in soil.},

Different analyses techniques were used to characterize the CAF-LDH-c sample, including X-ray diffraction, attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and scanning electronic microscopy. Soils were collected from twelve areas with different management and initial availability of P. The soils were subjected to six rates of P and were cultivated with plants. The predictive capacity of CAF-LDH-c, as a new extractant of P in different soils, was evaluated and compared to Mehlich-1 (M-1), Mehlich-3 (M-3), and Mixed Exchange Resin (MER) extractants. Chemical analyses performed on CAF-LDH-c showed that LDH in powder form was incorporated into the cellulose acetate film. There was a linear relation between P uptake by plants and extractable soil P in the soil by CAF-LDH-c, M-1, M-3, and MER extractants. The significant correlations between extracted P in the soil and P uptake by plants for CAF-LDH-c showed the efficacy of the new extractor and the newly proposed method for different types of soils.

This method, which is applicable at the local scale, employs a model of the surface heat budget to estimate the spatial distribution of thermal inertia-derived soil moisture (TISM) and an analytical footprint model to estimate dust source areas. It incorporates readily available satellite and meteorological data. The soil moisture inside the dust source area is estimated for individual dust phenomena observed at a synoptic surface observation site, and then, together with the corresponding observed wind speed, the threshold wind speed as a function of soil moisture is found by employing the parametrization of Fecan et al. (Ann Geophys 17:149-157, 1999). This relationship represents the local dust climatology at the observation site, although the data include some outliers. The results show that readily available data for the natural environment can be used, as an alternative to wind-tunnel data, with the parametrization used to derive the threshold wind-speed relation. The derived relation indicates the TISM and wind speed at which the probability of a dust phenomenon is 10\%. Moreover, the threshold wind-speed results are not sensitive to the principal footprint-model parameters. The TISM standard error of approximately 0.04 m(3) m(-3) could significantly affect the results under dry and weak-wind conditions, but this sensitivity can be avoided if the soil clay content or the soil type at the observation point is known.},

Four soil reference groups were sampled for the study. The NH4OAc extractant was used as standard method against which K values estimated by other methods were compared. Results showed that generally highly significant correlations existed among all the methods used for available K extraction. The coefficients of determination (R-2) values between NH4OAc method and the other methods were 0.90 (M-3), 0.70 (CaCl2), and 0.37(spectral). A statistically poor relationship (R-2= 0.07) was found between CaCl(2)and spectral methods. On an average, the K extracted by M-3 and CaCl(2)amounted to 106 and 49\% of NH4OAc K, respectively while the spectral method detected 196\% of the NH4OAc K. The highly significant correlation between different soil extraction methods indicated that any of the methods can be used to accurately predict the concentration of available K in the soil. The correlations between K concentration estimated by different methods and plant uptake (product of plant K concentration and dry matter yield) of K were the highest with M-3 and the lowest with spectral methods with R(2)values of 0.65, 0.64, 0.54 and 0.16 for M-3, NH4OAc, CaCl(2)and spectral methods, respectively. It can, therefore, be generalized that the M- 3 is a suitable extractant for K in Ethiopian soils, but further study is recommended to determine how these relationships could be translated to plant K uptake under field condition. Besides, the spectral measurement of K as a soil test method for heterogeneous group of soils warrants further investigation and refinement.},

	abstract = {Soil fertility is one of the most critical bases for high productivity and sustainability in crop production. Within-field heterogeneity is often problematic in both crop management practices and crop productivity. Besides, appropriate soil management practices leads to the effective carbon sequestration. Since the soil carbon content (SCC) is the most simple and effective indicator of soil fertility, accurate and high-resolution mapping of SCC is an essential basis for addressing these issues. Here, we developed a tractor-based hyperspectral sensing system for speedy and accurate mapping of SCC. A new hybrid spectral algorithm linking normalized difference spectral index (h-NDSI) and machine learning proved superior. Appropriate algorithms were implemented to generate diagnostic map and prescription map from SCC map for the variable-rate application of pellet manure. The field performance of the sensing/mapping system was tested in the farmers' fields in the Fukushima region of Japan where the within-field heterogeneity of soil fertility was disastrous due to the decontamination after the nuclear power-plant disaster. The structure and functioning of the system proved promising. Moreover, the spatial simulation by linking the SCC data and a dynamic simulation model clearly showed the significant impact of variable-rate application of pellet manure on the chronosequential change of SCC, within-field heterogeneity, and carbon stock. The systematic linkage of the sensing/mapping system with the variable-rate spreader and dynamic simulation model would be effective for improving soil fertility and soil carbon stock. Applicability of the system will be extended through an extensive validation of the predictive models.},

	abstract = {Purpose Soil nutrient management and fertilizer use by farmers are important for sustainable grain production. The authors examined the effect of an experimental agricultural extension program, the science and technology backyard, in promoting sustainable soil nutrient management in the North China Plain (NCP). The science and technology backyard integrates farmer field schools, field demonstrations, and case-to-case counselling to promote sustainable farming practices among rural smallholders. Design/methodology/approach The authors conducted a large-scale household survey of more than 2,000 rural smallholders. The authors used a multivariate regression analysis as the benchmark to assess the effect of the science-and-technology backyard on smallholder soil nutrient management. Furthermore, the authors used coarse exact matching (CEM) methods to control for potential bias due to self-selection and the (endogenous) switching regression approach as the main empirical analysis. Findings The results show that the science-and-technology backyard program increased smallholders' wheat yield by approximately 0.23 standard deviation; however, no significant increase in maize yield was observed. Regarding soil nutrient use efficiency, the authors found a significant improvement in smallholders' phosphorus and potassium use efficiencies for both wheat and maize production, and a significant improvement in nitrogen use efficiency for wheat production, but no significant improvement of nitrogen use efficiency for maize production. Originality/value This study evaluated a novel participatory agricultural extension model to improve soil nutrient management practices among smallholders. The integration of agronomists' scientific knowledge and smallholders' local contextual experiences could be an effective way to improve farmers' soil nutrient management. This study provides the first quantitative estimates based on rigorous impact assessment methods of this novel extension approach in rural China.},

We conducted sensitivity tests, including parameterization scheme tests and soil moisture tests using WRF-Chem. By comparing various combinations of parameterization schemes, which have considerable impacts on sand emissions, the most suitable parameterization scheme for WRF-Chem to simulate sand storms in Northwest China was selected for establishing models in future research. Based on the optimal combination of parameterization schemes, the sensitivity of sand emissions to soil moisture was tested, indicating that soil moisture has a substantial influence on sand emissions and revealing a nonlinear relationship between sand emissions and soil moisture. Although sand simulations are sensitive to soil moisture, the sand emission volume does not always increase with decreasing soil moisture content. Moreover, the soil moisture content simulated by WRF-Chem is quite different from that observed by satellites. Therefore, we selected ten sand storms that occurred in Northwest China in 2009-2018, including weak, moderate and strong sand storms, to explore the responses of sand storms of different intensities to soil moisture. Some experiments were conducted in two scenarios: scenario A was simulated only by WRF-Chem, and scenario B was designed by replacing the initial soil moisture field in WRF-Chem with soil moisture satellite data from AMSR2 and AMSR-E. Comparing the simulation results with in-situ ground-based and satellite-based measurements indicates that WRF-Chem can capture strong sand storms and some moderate sand storms, but the ability to simulate weak sand storms needs to be greatly improved. After introducing remote sensing soil moisture data into WRF-Chem, the simulation of sand emissions becomes more accurate, substantially improving the simulation results. Among the ten simulated sand storms, the AOD (aerosol optical depth) and PM10 simulation accuracies are improved for five and seven sand storms, respectively. After this improvement, the AOD correlation coefficient can reach 0.63, and the PM10 correlation coefficient can reach 0.60.},

	abstract = {The recent launch of the Sentinel-1 A and Sentinel-1B synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellite constellation has provided high-quality SAR data with fine spatial and temporal sampling characterizations (6(similar to)12 revisit days at 10 m spatial resolution). When combined with high-resolution optical remote sensing, this data can potentially be used for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval over vegetated areas. However, the suitability of different vegetation index (VI) types for the parameterization of vegetation water content in SAR vegetation scattering models requires further investigation. In this study, the widely-used physical-based Advanced Integral Equation Model (AIEM) is coupled with the Water Cloud Model (WCM) for the retrieval of field-scale soil moisture. Three different VIs (NDVI, EVI, and LAI) produced by two different satellite sensors (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat) are selected to examine their impact on the parameterization of vegetation water content, and subsequently, on soil moisture retrieval accuracy. Results indicate that, despite the different sensitivity of estimated surface roughness parameters to various VIs (i.e., this sensitivity is highest when utilizing MODIS EVI and lowest in the LAI-based model), the optimum roughness parameters derived from each VI exhibit no discernible difference. Consequently, the soil moisture retrieval accuracies show no noticeable sensitivity to the choice of a particular VI. Generally, meadow and grassland sites with small differences in VIderived roughness parameters exhibit good performance in soil moisture estimation. With respect to the relative components in the coupled model, the vegetative contribution to the scattering signal exceeds that of soil at VI about 0.6 similar to 0.8 [-] in NDVI-based models and 0.4 similar to 0.6 [-] in EVI-based models. This study provides insight into the proper selection of vegetation indices during the use of SAR and optical imagery for the retrieval of high-resolution surface soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Meteorological and agricultural information coupled with remote sensing observations has been used to assess the effectiveness of satellite-derived indices in yield estimations. The estimate yield models generated by both the regression (MLR) and Bayesian network (BBN) algorithms and their levels of predictive skill were assessed. The enhanced vegetation index (EVI2), soil water index (SWI), standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI) have been considered predictors for three rainfed crops (maize, sunflower and grapevine) grown in 37 districts in the Republic of Moldova (RM). We used the weekly EVI2, which was collected by MODIS instruments aboard the Terra satellite with a 250m x 250m spatial resolution and aggregated for each district during the 2000-2018 period. We also used the weekly SWI, which was collected from the ASCAT instruments with a 12 km x 12 km spatial resolution and aggregated for each district at the topsoil (0-40 cm; SWI-12) and the root-zone layer (0-100 cm; SWI-14) during 2000-2018. The multiscalar SPEI during 1951-2018 farming years proved to be a significant addition to the remote sensing indices and led to the development of a model that improved the yield assessment. The study also summarized (i) the optimal time window of satellite-derived SWIi and EVI2i for yield estimation, and (ii) the capability of remotely sensed indices for representing the spatio-temporal variations of agricultural droughts. We developed statistical soil-vegetation-atmosphere models to explore drought-related yield losses. The skill scores of the sunflower MLR and BBN models were higher than those for the maize and grape models and were able to estimate yields with reasonable accuracy and predictive power. The accurate estimation of maize, sunflower and grapevine yields was observed two months before the harvest (RMSE of similar to 1.2 tha-1). Despite the fact that summer crops (maize, sunflower) are able to develop a root system that uses the entire root zone depth, however, the SWI-12 had the stronger correlation with crop yield, then SWI-14. This explains much better the fit between yields of the crops and SWI-12, which represents soil moisture anomaly in the key rooting layer of soil. In any case, all summer crops showed negative correlations with each of the remote sensing soil moisture indices in the early and middle of the growing season, with SWI-12 performing better than SWI-14. Based on the crop-specific soil moisture model, we found that topsoil moisture declines in the most drought-susceptible crop growth stages, which indicates that RM is a good candidate for studying drought persists as main driver of rainfed yield losses in the south-eastern Europe.},

In this paper, a method of using VV polarization Sentinel-1 SAR and Landsat optical data to retrieve soil moisture data was proposed by combining the water cloud model (WCM) and the deep belief network (DBN). Since the simple combination of training data in the neural network cannot effectively improve the accuracy of the soil moisture inversion results, a WCM physical model was used to eliminate the effect of vegetation cover on the ground backscatter, in order to obtain the bare soil backscatter coefficient. This improved the correlation of ground soil backscatter characteristics with soil moisture. A DBN soil moisture inversion model based on the bare soil backscatter coefficients as the foundation training data combined with radar incidence angle and terrain factors obtained good inversion results. Studies in the Naqu area of the Tibetan Plateau showed that vegetation cover had a significant effect on the soil moisture, and the goodness of fit (R-2) between the backscatter coefficient and soil moisture before and after the elimination of vegetation cover was 0.38 and 0.50, respectively. The correlation between the backscatter coefficient and the soil moisture was improved after eliminating the vegetation cover. The inversion results of the DBN soil moisture model were further improved through iterative parameters. The model prediction reached its highest level of accuracy when the restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) was set to seven layers, the bias and R were 0.007 and 0.88, respectively. Ten-fold cross-validation showed that the DBN soil moisture model performed stably with different data. The prediction was further improved when the bare soil backscatter coefficient was used as the training data. The mean values of the root mean square error (RMSE), the inequality coefficient (TIC), and the mean absolute percent error (MAPE) were 0.023, 0.09, and 11.13, respectively.},

The results showed that the soil pH and soil organic carbon (SOC) significantly increased from 2008 to 2018, while available nitrogen (AN) significantly decreased from 2008 to 2018. The semi-variance revealed that except available phosphorus (AP), the spatial dependencies of soil properties increased from 2008 to 2018. An increasing south-north gradient was found for soil AN, AP, available potassium (AK) and SOC and a decreasing south-north gradient was found for soil pH. The average soil fertility in the whole area was increased from 2008 to 2018. Our findings demonstrated that the changes of the management measures were the reason for the change of soil properties from 2008 to 2018. Therefore, rational fertilization strategies and sod cultivation are recommended to maintain the long-term development of the producing forest.},

However, retrieval of soil moisture in the presence of vegetation/crops is still a very challenging task even becoming a more complex problem without using any ancillary datasets to compensate the vegetation effect for soil moisture retrievals in higher crop growth stages. This paper presents a novel multipath phase -based vegetation correction scheme for improved field -scale soil moisture retrieval using L -band data from Navigation with Indian Constellations (NavIC) based on GNSS-IR technique. The proposed three steps vegetation correction scheme categorized the crop as per growth stages for sensitivity analysis of NavIC derived multipath phase as GNSS-IR observables and significantly compensated vegetation effects on multipath phase for improved soil moisture retrievals. The proposed method utilized only multipath phase data as single SNR metrics without any ancillary data sets and validated during complete growth cycle of winter wheat crop (sowing to harvesting stages). It has been shown that the soil moisture retrieved using proposed vegetation correction scheme provides a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.87 and ubRMSD of 0.0341 m 3 /m 3 with in situ measured soil moisture, which is better than bare scheme with Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.71 and ubRMSD of 0.0480 m 3 /m 3 . Overall, proposed scheme has found highly effective for vegetation correction and has shown a good potential candidate for VSM retrievals over crop -covered soil using other GNSS constellations (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo and BeiDou etc.).

	abstract = {Remote sensing indices (RSIs) are essential for detection, mapping and monitoring of floods, soil moisture and tree characteristics. An understanding of the nexus between flood-recharged soil moisture (FRSM) and endangered biodiversity tree hotspots in semi-arid floodplains is critical. Specifically, the influence of FRSM on biophysical characteristics of keystone tree species with social, economic, ecological and environmental functions is crucial. However, the use of RSIs to understand the link between episodic floods, FRSM and trees, as well as their respective spatiotemporal dynamics within the semi-arid floodplains, remains largely unexplored. Hence, this study reviewed literature on the adoption of RSIs in understanding short-term phenological and long-term tree structural changes arising from flood-related infiltration. The reviewed literature shows the predominance of the normalised difference water index, the land surface water index and normalised difference vegetation index for flood, FRSM and tree mapping. The review also shows the emergence of SAR-based normalised difference flood index for understanding the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees. Although the review identified an increase in data availability, however, there are high costs of active commercial remote sensing data of superior quality and computing resources. Furthermore, available free data are incapable of penetrating canopies and have coarse spatial resolution constraining the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on trees. In view of increasing free SAR data and cloud-based computing resources, application of emerging deep learning algorithms offers prospects for the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees.},

This study uses multiple satellite data of snow water equivalent (SWE), soil moisture (SM), and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) to analyse their spatial-temporal changes in the seasonal freezing-thawing Tumen River Basin. Water transformation during the thawing period is determined through groundwater level fluctuations and correlation analysis methods; thus, the recharge effects of snowmelt and seasonally frozen soil thawing on soil moisture and groundwater are identified. The snow begins to melt in February, and snow water equivalent decreases gradually from upstream to downstream after reaching the peak. Furthermore, seasonally frozen soil melts gradually from March. Soil moisture downstream is higher than that in the upper and middle reaches. Additionally, the GWSA increases gradually in the thawing period, which is high in mountainous areas and low in plains. The Spearman correlation coefficient among Delta SWE, Delta SM, and Delta GWSA is more significant than 0.5 and dependent on altitude. With snow and frozen soil melting, vertical infiltration and meltwater percolation increase soil moisture and GWSA. This phenomenon is predominant at low altitudes ({\textless}600 m) and pore phreatic groundwater in the middle and lower reaches. However, snowmelt is the dominant factor in groundwater recharge at high-altitude upper reaches. For seasonal freezing-thawing zones, a close water transformation was observed between snow melting, soil water thawing, and groundwater in spring. Thus, the environmental and ecological impact of spring snowmelt and floods in freezing-thawing zones can be monitored using multi-source data.},

	abstract = {Multi-source soil moisture (SM) products provide a vigorous tool for the estimation of soil moisture on a large scale, but it is crucial to carry out the evaluation of those products before further application. In the present work, an evaluation framework on multi-source SM datasets over central and eastern agricultural areas of China was firstly proposed, based on a dense in situ SM monitoring network of 838 stations from 11 July 2012 to 31 December 2017. Each station adopted the most accurate gravimetric method for measuring the actual soil moisture. The effects of land use types and wet-dry conditions on the performances of multi-source SM products were further analyzed. Most satellite/reanalysis SM products could capture the spatial-temporal changes in soil moisture, especially for ERA5 products that matched the closest to the station-measured SM; by contrast, those satellite products showed poor spatial-temporal performances. Such phenomenon was also quantitatively demonstrated by the four statistical metrics correlation coefficient (CC), p-value, bias and root mean squared error (RMSE) between the satellite/reanalysis SM products and the ground-observed SM series. Further, most satellite/reanalysis SM products had poor performances in Forestland and Grassland areas, with a lower CC and a larger positive bias and RMSE. Such overestimation on soil moisture is possibly influenced by the inestimable parameter vegetation geometry and the vegetation water content in the radiative transfer models. The arid areas showed the worst CC between the station-observed SM data and different satellite/reanalysis SM products; meanwhile, the humid and semi-arid areas presented larger SM estimation errors than the other areas, especially for the satellite products. The fairly dry surface soil (arid area) and open water surface contamination (humid area) are suggested to hinder the reading of microwave-based retrieval systems. Additionally, the reanalysis SM products outperformed the satellite SM products in the evaluated areas, with better spatial-temporal performances, seasonality reflection and higher accuracy on SM estimation (higher CC, and lower bias and RMSE). This is because the reanalysis datasets assimilated various sources of datasets, especially the ground-observed data, with high quality. The evaluated results could provide guidance for fusing different satellite/reanalysis products, as a new feasible alternative to monitoring SM information in the future.},

The coefficient of determination (R2), root man squared error (RMSE), and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of the TVQI increased by 0.2, 0.3\%, and 4.6, respectively, compared to those of the TVDI. Moreover, the TVQI is closely related to cumulative precipitation within 1 month, as the correlation is the highest in this time interval. The accuracy of surface soil moisture retrieval was good, with relative error (RE), R2, and NSE values of 6\%, 0.9 and 0.7, respectively. The deep soil moisture estimations performed well at both 20 cm and 40 cm, with an average R2 above 0.9, an average RE below 0.1 and an average NSE above 0.7. However, the prediction accuracy decreased as the soil depth increased. Topt, the best characteristic time length of the exponential filter, was significantly related to the soil bulk density, while the precipitation meteorological condition had little effect. Moreover, the average Topt of all stations can be used instead of the Topt of each station. Beijing, the study area, is dry throughout the year, with soil moisture reaching a minimum in May and a maximum in July.

Utilising the capability of agro-ecosystem models to quantify the interactions of crop productivity with management and environmental variables, the APSIM model was evaluated against six and an eight-year field trial datasets comprised of different crop rotations and fertiliser rates under two contrasting agro-ecological conditions in South Africa (clay soil with a mean rainfall of 871 mm versus a sandy soil with a 570 mm rainfall). Model output was compared to observed grain yield, aboveground dry matter, soil organic carbon (SOC), and mineral nitrogen (N-min) dynamics. APSIM was able to reproduce the observed grain yield dynamics fairly well as indicated by a Wilmott index of agreement of 0.90. Prediction accuracy, as indicated by the absolute model error across all crops, however, only reached 39\%. Simulated N-min and SOC dynamics showed similar patterns to the observations. Subsequently, the model was applied in a ten-year simulation experiment with rotation treatments (14 rotations, respectively intercropping systems, including a maize monoculture control), fertiliser levels (zero and 70 kg N ha(-1)), and residue management (retained and removed) for the two sites. For low input systems, such as smallholder farms, residue management and legume integration are of the utmost importance to maintain SOC and more pronounced N-min levels, which, for the sandy soil, resulted in an average maize yield increase of up to 1000 kg ha(-1). Maize monoculture treatments with residues removed reduced SOC moderately by 0.04-0.08 \%, while yields declined strongly ({\textgreater} 1000 kg ha(-1)) over the simulated period of ten years. In commercial, fertilised cropping systems, allocating land to cultivate crops other than maize reduced the simulated total yield performance. This diversification disadvantage has to be considered against the benefits of increased SOC and yields in the medium-term, i.e. a period of ten years. For the commercial systems, maize intercropped with delayed sown oats or cowpea appeared promising.},

	abstract = {Rainwater is a primary water source for the hilly and gully region of the Loess Plateau where an improved efficiency of rainwater utilization is crucial for sustainable agricultural development. A new system, comprised of rainwater harvesting, concentrating infiltration with multi-holed pipe and mulching (RIM), was designed to sustain soil moisture at a proper level in rain-fed orchards in the hilly and gully loess region of China. This study monitored changes in soil moisture and distribution over soil profiles using four treatments: (a) RIM1 with two rainwater harvesting areas, two infiltration pipes and film mulching, (b) RIM2 with one rainwater harvesting area, one infiltration pipe and film mulching, (c) film mulching (FM) only and (d) traditional apple orchard as a control treatment (CK) as a baseline in this experiment. The results showed that mean soil moisture content (SMC) in a range of soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for RIM1 and RIM2 treatments increased by 43.01\% and 34.78\% in 2018 and 30.55\% and 26.41\% in 2019, respectively. Dividing the soil vertical profile into three layers, i.e., an easy-changing layer (0-60 cm), an increasing or decreasing layer (60-180 cm), and a relatively steady layer (180-300 cm), this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture. The RIM1 and RIM2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of wetted areas over the whole soil layers. The soil moisture was replenished to a horizontal distance of 1.5 m and 2.5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the RIM1 treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1.5 m apart from the trunk under the RIM2 treatment. While the seasonal variation of SMC in the easy-changing soil layer (0-60 cm) corresponded to precipitation consistently, the SMC in the deep soil layers (60-300 cm) was not sensitive to precipitation. As a result, the treatments of RIM1, RIM2 and FM improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with those under the control treatment. In particular, the RIM1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study. The results highlighted the efficiency of the RIM system in enhancing the soil moisture, which may be useful to improve an orchard production for rain-fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of China.},

This study evaluates the uncertainty in soil moisture estimates using the five different forcing precipitation data sets from the: Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS), Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM)-Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA), Precipitation Estimation from Remotely Sensed Information using Artificial Neural Networks-Climate Data Record (PERSIANN-CDR), Global Precipitation Mission (GPM), and Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) gridded data over the Indian domain using the Noah land surface model within the NASA Land Information System (LIS). The simulations are conducted using the five different precipitation data sets over the Indian subcontinent for 3 years from 2012-2014. Except for the rainfall forcing, the simulation environment was retained identical for each of the five simulations in terms of model configuration and physics. The simulation results are compared with the weekly soil moisture station data available from the IMD for different depths. Results indicate that the LIS-Noah soil moisture estimates forced with IMD rainfall agreed better among the five simulations with IMD in situ data. The simulated output soil moisture using IMD as precipitation data has the lowest soil moisture RMSE for all 3 years as compared to other simulations, while the GPM forced simulation has a higher RMSE value for all 3 years. The correlation coefficients of simulated soil moisture outputs with respect to different in situ stations show that, among the five simulations, IMD forced simulation has a higher correlation coefficient for the majority of stations for the years 2012 and 2013, while for the year 2014, GPM forced simulation shows better results. The correlation coefficient between the PERSIANN-CDR forced simulation output and in situ stations shows poor results as compared to other products. IMD gridded rainfall forced simulation is superior to the other four precipitation forced simulations in all study areas and could be used in the future for hydrological and meteorological models.},

However, these management operations impose a stress on the trees, increase production costs and given the complexity of ACS; they may not lead to an increase in crop yield. Thus, the objective of this study was to measure the impact of root pruning in a Mediterranean ACS on soil water content and on the yield of two varieties each of barley and durum wheat. To achieve this, an experiment with three different treatments was conducted: monocrop (MC), and two 23-year-old hybrid walnut ACS, with (ACS\_RP +) and without (ACS\_RP-) root pruning. In each system, grain yield and yield components were measured and the microclimate and soil water content were recorded during the growing season. The ACS had lower incident radiation in the understory than MC and this radiation was unevenly distributed along the alley. Besides, ACS had lower air temperature during the day and higher at night in comparison with MC. Also, soil water content was higher in ACS than in MC. Within ACS, the soil water content was similar until the tree budburst but thereafter lower in ACS\_RP-. The grain yield of both cereals was lower in ACS than in MC. Among the ACS there were no differences in grain yield or in any yield component for both cereals. From the above, it can be concluded that, under the conditions presented in the study, the root pruning increased the water available for the crops, but this did not increase crop yield. It is inferred that the main limiting factor for grain yield in the studied ACS was other than soil water.},

The main purpose of this study was to estimate daily discharge by employing an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model using rainfall and soil moisture data at three different depths (5 cm, 100 cm and bedrock) for the Damanganga basin. The length of the data for the study period 1983-2022 is 39 years. The model employed nine membership functions for each variable of soil moisture, rainfall, discharge and 30 rules were optimized. The results were compared considering a range of model performance indicators as correlation coefficient (R-2) and Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) coefficient. The model application results shows that soil moisture at bedrock gives more precise value of daily discharge with (R-2) and NSE value as 0.9936 and 0.9981, respectively, as compared to the soil moisture at a depth of 5 and 100 cm. The better results obtained for the measurement of soil moisture in the deeper soil layer are consistent with the hydrological behavior anticipated for the analyzed catchment, where the root-zone soil layer is the driver of the runoff response rather than the surface observations. This study can be helpful to hydrologists in selecting appropriate rainfall-runoff models.},

Forecast correlation skill is decomposed into contributions from persistence of the initial anomalies and contributions not linked to persistence, with performance largely driven by the accuracy of the initial conditions in regions of strong persistence. Seasonal soil moisture correlation skill is significant for several months into the hindcasts depending on initial and target months, with contributions not linked to persistence becoming more notable at longer lead times. For the first 2-4 months, the quality of CanSIPSv2.1 ensemble mean forecasts tends to be higher on average during summer and fall and is comparable to that of the best performing model, whereas CanSIPSv2.1 outperforms the single models during spring and winter. For longer lead times, remote climate influences from the Pacific Ocean are notable and contribute to predictable soil moisture variability in teleconnected regions.},

This effect becomes more complex to be evaluated for an Earth-Air Heat Exchanger (EAHE) because of its non-stable energy performance due to a large fluctuation of the temperature of air. In this study, the impact of soil moisture content and soil thermal properties has been investigated on the long-term energy performance of an instrumented EAHE site. First, a full-scale experimental EAHE site in University of Strasbourg as well as its measured data are presented. The thermal properties of different soil layers present in the site were experimentally and theoretically characterized with different soil moisture contents. Based on these results, an analytical solution was proposed to simulate the soil temperature of the field and the output air temperature of the EAHE. A computer program based on this analytical solution was developed to assess the performance of the system for a period of three years. The numerical calculation was validated for an average saturation condition by comparing simulation results with measured data. Different soil saturation conditions were also used in the numerical simulation to consider the effect of soil moisture on the system performance. The results show that if the turbulent flow of the circulating air is fully developed, the difference of the exchanged energy could reach more than 40\%. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

However, vegetation strongly affects with CRNS soil moisture measurements. Variations in vegetation over time change how the CRNS is affected, which is more challenging than a stable vegetation cover, particularly during CRNS roving, where one crosses many vegetation covers. To correct vegetation, we hypothesized that Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) can represent vegetation hydrogen pools. From 2020 to 2023, at the 74 plots with varying vegetation cover near the Qilian Mountains, the experiments for soil moisture measurements were conducted in shrubs, forests, deserts, farmlands, and grasslands using a Cosmic-ray Neutron Rover. The measured neutron intensity clearly varied across different landscapes, and the calibrated parameter N0 differed among 74 plots. The variations in vegetation cover resulted in low measurement accuracy for CRNS. All three NDVI vegetation correction methods (NDVI-theta NDVI method, NDVI-NDVIave method, and NDVI-N0 method) offered by the study could improve accuracy of soil moisture measurements. In the optimal NDVI-N0 method, the relationship between NDVI and N0 was established using a power function y = 373.9 (x + 0.015)-0.136 (R2 = 0.77), which had the capability to decrease the root mean square error between oven-dried and measured soil moisture from 0.093 to 0.032 g g-1 in our study area. Employing NDVI instead of biomass for CRNS vegetation correction can substantially reduce workload and effectively enhance CRNS soil moisture measurements, showing the potential for upscaling soil moisture.},

This is partly due to the fact that observational rescaling approaches for bias correction used in soil moisture DA systems are less effective when unmodeled processes such as irrigation are the dominant source of systematic biases. In this article, we demonstrate an alternative approach, i.e. anomaly correction for overcoming this limitation. Unlike the rescaling approaches, the proposed method does not scale remote sensing soil moisture retrievals to the model climatology, but it extracts the temporal variability information from the retrievals. The study demonstrates this approach through the assimilation of soil moisture retrievals from the Soil Moisture Active Passive mission into the Noah land surface model. The results demonstrate that DA using the anomaly correction method can better capture the effect of irrigation on soil moisture in agricultural areas while providing comparable performance to the DA integrations using rescaling approaches in non-irrigated areas. These findings emphasize the need to reduce inconsistencies between remote sensing and the models so that assimilation methods can employ information from remote sensing more directly to develop representations of unmodeled processes such as irrigation.},

The results showed that in the short term, the decomposition of straw was better in both the rotray tillage and deep loosening+deep rotary modes than in the no-tillage mode, and the addition of decomposer significantly promoted the decomposition of straw and the release of carbon from straw, among them, the RT+S treatment had the highest straw decomposition proportion and carbon release proportion in all sampling periods. After a one year experimental cycle, the RT+S treatment showed the highest proportion of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin decomposition with 35.49\%, 84.23\% and 85.50\%, respectively, and soil SOC, MBC and DOC contents were also higher than the other treatments with an increase of 2.30 g kg(-1), 14.22 mg kg(-1) and 25.10 mg kg(-1), respectively, compared to the pre-experimental soil. Our results show that in the short term, to accelerate the decomposition rate of returned straw and increase the content of various forms of carbon in soil, rotary tillage can be used to return the straw to the field, while also spraying straw decomposer on its surface.

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has emerged as a reliable method for soil moisture and snow estimation. However, the applicability of this method beyond research has been limited due to, among others, the use of relatively large and expensive sensors. This paper presents the tests conducted on a new scintillator-based sensor especially designed to jointly measure neutron counts, muons and total gamma rays. The neutron signal is first compared against two conventional gas-tube-based CRNS sensors at two locations. The estimated soil moisture is further assessed at four agricultural sites, based on gravimetric soil moisture collected within the sensor footprint. Muon fluxes are compared to the incoming neutron variability measured at a neutron monitoring station and total gammas counts are compared to the signal detected by a gamma ray spectrometer. The results show that the neutron dynamic detected by the new scintillator-based CRNS sensor is well in agreement with conventional CRNS sensors. The derived soil moisture also agreed well with the gravimetric soil moisture measurements. The muons and the total gamma rays simultaneously detected by the sensor show promising features to account for the incoming variability and for discriminating irrigation and precipitation events, respectively. Further experiments and analyses should be conducted, however, to better understand the accuracy and the added value of these additional data for soil moisture estimation. Overall, the new scintillator design shows to be a valid and compact alternative to conventional CRNS sensors for non-invasive soil moisture monitoring and to open the path to a wide range of applications.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture drought, as one of the most important drought categories, is determined by both water supply (e.g., precipitation) and demand (e.g., potential evapotranspiration). To shed light on the underlying mechanisms driving soil moisture drought, the statistical multiple linear regression, machine learning, and modeling ex-periments methods have been pervasively used in early studies. However, these methods neglect the collinearity and interactions of climate variables, and thus cannot reflect the direct and indirect interaction of factors leading to soil moisture drought. To reveal the synergistic effects of water supply and demand on soil moisture drought, this study quantified the contributions of key drivers to the change of soil moisture drought by a path analysis method to exhibit the relationships between atmospheric movement state and soil moisture drought. Prior to applying the systematic path analysis model, we identified the spatial patterns of soil moisture droughts at different depths by using a state-of-art three-dimensional drought recognition method in China. Our results showed that precipitation deficits dominated the interannual variation of soil moisture drought while increasing potential evapotranspiration only had marginal intensification in drought. The response of soil moisture drought to potential evapotranspiration was magnified by drought deterioration, especially in basically severe drought conditions. The total column water vapor and the horizontal divergence of the vapor flux, as well as temperature, directly affected precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and led to soil moisture drought through various direct and indirect processes. This study highlighted that the interactions among precipitation, potential evapotranspiration, and atmospheric vapor movement state in space and time were important for understanding the drought development mechanisms.},

The objective of this study was to propose a shadow removal algorithm to eliminate the effect of shadows in soil surface images, so as to improve the accuracy of SMC estimation. The structure of the proposed soil shadow generative adversarial networks (SS GAN) was a circulating network, which is an unsupervised method and does not require paired shadow image sets for network training. Four loss functions were defined for the network to effectively remove shadows and ensure texture detail and color consistency. This method is compared with traditional methods, supervised and unsupervised deep learning techniques by comparative experiments. Evaluations were made from visual and quantitative comparisons. Visually, the best shadow removal method was proved, it almost has no shadow boundaries or shadow areas visible for samples. The peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM) were used to quantitatively compare shadow removal images with real non-shadow images. The PSNR and SSIM of SS GAN were 28.46 and 0.95 respectively, which are superior to other methods, indicating that the images processed by SS GAN were closer to the real non-shadow images. Field experiments results shown that SS GAN has excellent shadow removal performance in the self-developed vehicle-mounted detection system. In order to verify the improvement effect of shadow removal image on SMC estimation accuracy, further field test was conducted to estimate SMC. Compared with SMC estimation results before and after shadow removal, R-2 increased from 0.69 to 0.76, and root mean square error decreased from 1.39 to 0.94\%. The results show that the proposed method can effectively remove the shadow of soil image and improve the accuracy of SMC estimation in farmland.},

	abstract = {Downscaling of soil moisture data is important for high resolution hydrological modeling. Most downscaling studies in the literature have used spatially discontinuous land surface temperature (LST) maps as the main auxiliary parameter, which limits the creation of continuous soil moisture maps. The number of studies on soil moisture downscaling with machine learning that use gapless LST maps is limited. With this motivation, a hybrid reconstruction method has been proposed in this study to practically obtain continuous LST maps, which are then used to produce high resolution surface soil moisture (SSM) datasets. The proposed method is shown to have high mean performance with R2 and RMSE values of 0.94 and 1.84 degrees K, respectively, for the period between 2019 and 2022. The developed reconstructed LST maps were then used to downscale original 9 km spatial resolution soil moisture datasets of SMAP L3 and SMAP L4 with Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithm. The RF model were run with four different rainfall datasets, and the MSWEP rainfall dataset was found to produce the best results. The use of antecedent rainfall values as input variables in machine learning models has been shown to improve the performance of the models R2 0.76 to 0.93. The accuracy of the downscaled data was later evaluated for Western Anatolia Basins (WAB) in T \& uuml;rkiye with 31 in-situ stations. The downscaled SMAP L4 had good average statistical indicators R (0.815 +/- 0.1), RMSE (0.09 +/- 0.047 cm3/cm3), and ubRMSE (0.058 +/- 0.025 cm3/ cm3). Downscaled SMAP L3 was also validated with in-situ observations with satisfactory R (0.79 +/- 0.074), RMSE (0.09 +/- 0.043 cm3/cm3), and ubRMSE (0.06 +/- 0.026 cm3/cm3) statistics. Furthermore, the performance of the downscaled SMAP L3 was also cross validated with SMAP + Sentinel 1 (L2) dataset between 2019 and 2022. The mean statistics of R (0.761 +/- 0.11) and Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD) (0.05 +/- 0.014 cm3/ cm3) between downscaled SMAP L3 and L2 data revealed that the new reconstruction method of LST used in the RF model for downscaling of soil moisture performed well to obtain high resolution soil moisture datasets. The proposed technique also overcame the difficulties associated with coastal regions where data was masked for quality considerations, by not only enhancing overall spatial resolution but also filling these data gaps and giving a complete SSM coverage.},

Data assimilation, as a method of integrating multi-geographic spatial data, plays an increasingly important role in estimating soil moisture. Model prediction error, an important part of the background field information, occupies a position that could not be ignored in data assimilation. The model prediction error in data assimilation consists of three parts: forcing data error, initial field error, and model error. However, the influence of model error in current data assimilation methods has not been completely considered in many studies. Therefore, we proposed a theoretical framework of the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) data assimilation based on the breeding of growing modes (BGM) method. This framework used the BGM method to perturb the initial field error term w of EnKF, and the EnKF data assimilation to assimilate the data to obtain the soil moisture analysis value. The feasibility and superiority of the proposed framework were verified, taking into consideration breeding length and ensemble size through experiments. We conducted experiments and evaluated the accuracy of the BGM and the Monte Carlo (MC) methods. The experiment showed that the BGM method could improve the estimation accuracy of the assimilated soil moisture and solve the problem of model error which is not fully expressed in data assimilation. This study can be widely used in data assimilation and has a significant role in weather forecast and drought monitoring.},

The laboratory tests completed using three different types of soil show that the drawdown curve was sensitive to theta(in) for all three soils. This resulted in yielding K-s values that are sensitive to the values of theta(in). The lowest value of K-s was observed when the MPDI was used under wet conditions. To obtain a consistent estimate of K-s, a new correction factor was developed. This factor can be multiplied with the geometrical coefficient used in the governing equations of the MPDI to make appropriate corrections. After employing the correction factor, the variations in K-s values for all three tested soils decreased from 66\%, 61\% and 59\%, to 26\%, 16\% and 26\%, respectively. In situ experimental tests also show similar results and the coefficient of variation decreased from 81\% to 61\% after applying the correction factor. The performance was further validated by testing the relative performance of the MPDI against the results obtained using Minidisk Infiltrometer (MDI) under varying theta(in) values. Results from the MDI show that the coefficient of variation for the K-s values of the three soils were 20\%, 28\%, and 32\%, which are similar to the variations obtained after applying the correction factor in the MPDI model calculations. The aforementioned results indicate that the correction method proposed in this study is a useful method for improving the overall performance of MPDI.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture monitoring is a significant aspect of environmental and agricultural studies, and Global Navigation Satellite System Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) has emerged as a promising technology for this purpose. Traditionally, GNSS-IR is mainly employed for bare soil experiments, and the effectiveness of bare soil retrieval algorithm will be reduced due to the influence of vegetation and meteorological, etc. To address the limitations of the bare-soil retrieval algorithm, a multi-feature soil moisture retrieval approach was proposed. This approach integrated multiple factors including GNSS signals, cumulative precipitation, effective reflection height, and Normalized Microwave Reflection Index (NMRI), and then multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was employed to build retrieval models. In this study, measurements from the Plate Boundary Observatory (PBO) H2O networks and a self-built site in Henan, China were used for experiments and validation, and the geographical environment of stations are various. The experimental results demonstrated several key findings: (1) The delay phase is not sensitive to the variations in soil moisture before and after precipitation, but by integrating the cumulative precipitation data, the accuracy of the model could be improved. (2) The introduction of NMRI and reflection height can help remove the influence of vegetation and penetration depth. (3) Compared between three retrieval models (i.e., unary linear regression, multiple linear regression, and MLP), the decrease in the mean absolute error (MAE) of MLP is up to 96\% most and the mean coefficient of determination (R2) is all above 0.98. Meanwhile, this study proved that the proposed method could fully utilize satellite reflection signals from all directions and better reflect the fluctuation of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Data assimilation is well suited for merging observed and simulated values to improve hydrologic forecasts. Typically, observation data that is assimilated into hydrologic models can be obtained from in situ gauges, radar, and remote sensing. In an urban environment, the benefits of soil moisture assimilation are not clearly defined. This work aims to identify the feasible imperviousness range a which it is advantageous to assimilate remotely sensed soil moisture to improve hydrologic forecasting in an urban watershed. A synthetic experiment was set up to simulate the retrieval of soil moisture onto a spatial grid and assimilate it into a hydrologic model. Subcatchments were set up such that they would represent areas within that retrieval grid with varying levels of development. Multiple rainfall events were simulated with forecasts of up to 12 hours for each sub-catchment. The results of these simulations indicate that when areal average soil moisture is assimilated into an urban subcatchment model which has a level of impervious that exceeds a threshold value, there is a decrease in model forecast performance, indicating that soil moisture assimilation is no longer beneficial. A quick way to determine the imperviousness threshold was then derived using a modified NRCS-CN method which matches the results of the synthetic experiments. This methodology was then further tested using real-world urban watersheds and shown to be a valid approach that can be used to quickly determine whether soil moisture assimilation would be beneficial for the watershed of interest. In general, this work has shown that hydrologic forecasting in an urban watershed can benefit from soil moisture assimilation even when imperviousness reaches 65-75\%. Additionally, this work found a quick way to validate further if soil moisture assimilation is beneficial using some simple watershed characteristics.},

It also shows its importance in monitoring agricultural basins where the meteorological and topographic con-ditions vary greatly. In this case, the reliability of soil moisture content (SMC) monitoring for theses basins could be promised. The main objective of this paper is to develop a synergic method of radar and optical data, as well as an on-site sampling scheme, to accurately estimate SMC in the basin. The reason is that in the winter wheat production area of Dawen River basin in China, there are few conventional SMC testing equipment. Considering the characteristics of different crops and the conditions of crops in different growth periods, the VV polarization mode of Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images was used to retrieve SMC. Combined with the Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) extracted from Sentinel-2 MSI optical images and the optimized Water Cloud Model (WCM), the surface backscattering coefficient was obtained by eliminating vegetation moisture content (VMC), and the SMC model was established. The results showed that from March to May in 2020, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between the estimated VMC and the field observation was 0.655, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between the two was 0.334. In the inversion algorithm model, the R-2 be-tween the retrieved SMC and the field measurement was 0.506, and the RMSE was 3.725.},

	abstract = {Understanding groundwater recharge processes is important for sustainable water resource management. Experimental approaches to study recharge in karst areas often focus on analysing the aquifer response using a disintegration of its outlet signals, but only a few approaches directly investigate the recharge processes that occur at the surface of the system. Soil moisture measurements have a high potential to investigate water infiltration to deeper soil depth or epikarst with an easy and not too intrusive installation. They can yield long-term measurements with high temporal resolution. Using these advantages, we developed and tested a method to estimate recharge based on soil moisture measurements. The method consists of the extraction of linked events in rainfall, soil moisture, and discharge time series, as well as a subsequent fitting of the parameters of a simple drainage model to calculate karst recharge from soil moisture metrics of individual events. The fitted parameters could be interpreted in physically meaningful terms and were related to the properties of the karstic system. The model was tested and validated in a karst catchment located in southwest Germany with hourly precipitation, soil moisture, and discharge data of 8 years duration. The soil moisture measurements were distributed among grassland (n = 8) and woodland areas (n = 7) at 20 cm depth. A threshold of about 35 \% (+/- 8 \%) of volumetric water content was necessary to initiate effective infiltration. Soil moisture averaged during the wetting period of each event was the best metric for the prediction of recharge. The model performed reasonably well, estimating recharge during single rainfall events. It was also capable of simulating 88 \% of the average annual recharge volume despite considerable differences in the performance between years. The event-based approach is potentially applicable to other karstic systems where soil moisture and precipitation measurements are available to predict karst groundwater recharge.},

	abstract = {The Iberian Peninsula is prone to drought due to the high variability in the Mediterranean climate with severe consequences for drinking water supply, agriculture, hydropower and ecosystem functioning. Because of the complexity and relevance of droughts in this region, it is necessary to increase our understanding of the temporal interactions of precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture that originate from drought within the Ebro basin, in northeastern Spain, as the study region. Remote sensing and land-surface models provide high-spatial-resolution and high-temporal-resolution data to characterize evapotranspiration and soil moisture anomalies in detail. The increasing availability of these datasets has the potential to overcome the lack of in situ observations of evapotranspiration and soil moisture. In this study, remote sensing data of evapotranspiration from MOD16A2 and soil moisture data from SMOS1km as well as SURFEX-ISBA land-surface model data are used to calculate the evapotranspiration deficit index (ETDI) and the soil moisture deficit index (SMDI) for the period 2010-2017. The study compares the remote sensing time series of the ETDI and SMDI with the ones estimated using the land-surface model SURFEX-ISBA, including the standardized precipitation index (SPI) computed at a weekly scale. The study focuses on the analysis of the time lags between the indices to identify the synchronicity and memory of the anomalies between precipitation, evapotranspiration and soil moisture. Lag analysis results demonstrate the capabilities of the SPI, ETDI and SMDI drought indices computed at a weekly scale to give information about the mechanisms of drought propagation at distinct levels of the land-atmosphere system. Relevant feedback for both antecedent and subsequent conditions is identified, with a preeminent role of evapotranspiration in the link between rainfall and soil moisture. Both remote sensing and the land-surface model show capability to characterize drought events, with specific advantages and drawbacks of the remote sensing and land-surface model datasets. Results underline the value of analyzing drought with dedicated indices, preferably at a weekly scale, to better identify the quick self-intensifying and mitigating mechanisms governing drought, which are relevant for drought monitoring in semi-arid areas.},

For a country like India, with a huge population to cater, the problem becomes more serious. Since the inception of remote sensing in scientific agriculture management, optical remote sensing along with field data has been used for soil health monitoring and mapping. SAR or microwave remote sensing has an all-weather and high temporal data availability which has found applications for various domains. For soil health studies of multiple soil classes and sub-classes of same type, both aerial and spaceborne SAR remote sensing is currently in use for a multitude of monitoring and parameter modelling approaches. This study utilizes Sentinel 1 A, C-band SAR remote sensing data with VV and VH polarization channels for surface soil moisture estimation for alluvial soil and its sub-types in Rupnagar of Punjab state in India. While Index based OLS Regression method for soil moisture estimation was done using backscatter from Sentinel-1A SAR data, it was validated using Normalized Differential Moisture Index (NDMI) generated from Sentinel 2 optical datasets. This approach though did not consider the actual soil moisture data from field yet gave a low Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.5 and R2-statistics of 0.72 (72\%) in training and testing phases. The Index based OLS (Ordinary Least Squares) Regression method for soil moisture estimation aims to establish a technique for cases when field data is either not available or the study area is not easily accessible. In the statistical approach with field data, the same OLS model, when replaced by on-field surface soil moisture data gave a RMSE of 1.9 and R2-statistics of 0.968 and 0.948 in training and testing phases respectively at 97.5\% confidence level. The study is significant for using freely available optical and SAR remote sensing data parameters synergistically, in a simplified manner for surface soil moisture estimation.

	abstract = {The influence of soil water content on Aleppo pine growth variability is analyzed against climatic variables, using satellite and modeled soil moisture databases. The study was made with a dendrochronological series of 22 forest sites in Spain with different environmental conditions. From the results of the correlation analysis, at both daily and monthly scales, it was observed that soil moisture was the variable that correlated the most with tree growth and the one that better identified the critical periods for this growth. The maximum correlation coefficients obtained with the rest of the variables were less than half of that obtained for soil moisture. Multiple linear regression analysis with all combinations of variables indicated that soil moisture was the most important variable, showing the lowest p-values in all cases. While identifying the role of soil moisture, it was noted that there was appreciable variability between the sites, and that this variability is mainly modulated by water availability, rather than thermal conditions. These results can contribute to new insights into the ecohydrological dynamics of Aleppo pine and a methodological approach to the study of many other species.},

A novel meta-estimating approach, called Voting Regression (VR), was used to combine the Gradient Boosting (GB) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithms for developing a new hybrid predictive model named GB- SVR. Six SM products from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2), and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) were used to predict SM at 40 in-situ SM sampling locations. The performance of the proposed novel forecasting technique was evaluated using Correlation Coefficient (CC), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The results showed the superiority of GB- SVR compared to GB and SVR, with an average improvement of 17\%, 10\%, and 13\% in CC, RMSE, and MAE, respectively, in predicting in-situ SM. The model performance in different climates, soil textures, and land covers showed its better prediction accuracy in croplands (R-2 = 0.86), loam soil (R-2 = 0.74) and cold climate (R-2 = 0.71), while the least in clay soil and barren lands. Besides, the in-situ SM prediction using remote sensing SM data performed better than that obtained using in-situ air and soil temperature. The proposed methodology can be used for accurate SM prediction in regions lacking in-situ SM data.},

In recent years, progress has been made in its in-depth application and development in the Tibetan Plateau (TP) which has a complex natural environment. This paper systematically reviews and summarizes the research progress and the main applications of L-band passive microwave RS observations and associated SM retrievals on the TP. The progress of observing and simulating L-band emission based on ground-, aircraft-based and spaceborne platforms, developing regional-scale SM observation networks, as well as validating satellite-based SM products and developing SM retrieval algorithms are reviewed. On this basis, current problems of L-band emission simulation and SM retrieval on the TP are outlined, such as the fact that current evaluations of SM products are limited to a short-term period, and evaluation and improvement of the forward land emission model and SM retrieval algorithm are limited to the site or grid scale. Accordingly, relevant suggestions and prospects for addressing the abovementioned existing problems are finally put forward. For future work, we suggest (i) sorting out the in situ observations and conducting long-term trend evaluation and analysis of current L-band SM products, (ii) extending current progress made at the site/grid scale to improve the L-band emission simulation and SM retrieval algorithms and products for both frozen and thawed ground at the plateau scale, and (iii) enhancing the application of L-band satellite-based SM products on the TP by implementing methods such as data assimilation to improve the understanding of plateau-scale water cycle and energy balance.},

	abstract = {One reason arid and semi-arid environments have been used to store waste is due to low groundwater recharge, presumably limiting the potential for meteoric water to mobilize and transport contaminants into groundwater. The U.S. Department of Energy Office of Legacy Management (LM) is evaluating selected uranium mill tailings disposal cell covers to be managed as evapotranspiration (ET) covers, where vegetation is used to naturally remove water from the cover profile via transpiration, further reducing deep percolation. An important parameter in monitoring the performance of ET covers is soil moisture (SM). If SM is too high, water may drain into tailings material, potentially transporting contaminants into groundwater; if SM is too low, radon flux may increase through the cover. However, monitoring SM via traditional instrumentation is invasive, expensive, and may fail to account for spatial heterogeneity, especially over vegetated disposal cells. Here we investigated the potential for non-invasive SM monitoring using radar remote sensing and other geospatial data to see if this approach could provide a practical, accurate, and spatially comprehensive tool to monitor SM. We used theoretical simulations to analyze the sensitivity of multi-frequency radar backscatter to SM at different depths of a field-scale (3 ha) drainage lysimeter embedded within an in-service LM disposal cell. We then evaluated a shallow and deep form of machine learning (ML) using Google Earth Engine to integrate multi-source observations and estimate the SM profile across six soil layers from depths of 0-2 m. The ML models were trained using in situ SM measurements from 2019 and validated using data from 2014 to 2018 and 2020-2021. Model predictors included backscatter observations from satellite synthetic aperture radar, vegetation, temperature products from optical infrared sensors, and accumulated, gridded rainfall data. The radar simulations confirmed that the lower frequencies (L- and P-band) and smaller incidence angles show better sensitivity to deeper soil layers and an overall larger SM dynamic range relative to the higher frequencies (C- and X-band). The ML models produced accurate SM estimates throughout the soil profile (r values from 0.75 to 0.94; RMSE = 0.003-0.017 cm3/cm3; bias = 0.00 cm3/cm3), with the simpler shallow-learning approach outperforming a selected deeplearning model. The ML models we developed provide an accurate, cost-effective tool for monitoring SM within ET covers that could be applied to other vegetated disposal cell covers, potentially including those with rock-armored covers.},

	abstract = {Soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) was estimated as the relative difference of soil temperature (T-s) to its maximum (T-s(max)) and minimum (T-s(min)) values at `minimum and maximum' soil moisture (SM), i.e., SEE= (T-s(max)-T-s)/ (T-s(max)-T-s(min)). This thermal indicator of SM (SMI) has been proven effective in downscaling satellite microwave SM in some local areas. However, the T-s(max) and T-s(min) were usually determined in an empirical way which is not conducive to a wider range of applications or global downscaling. In addition to the Ts-based SMI (SEE), solo-LST (Land Surface Temperature)-based SMI and composite index of LST and optical SMIs have also been widely used in downscaling microwave SM. However, they have rarely been evaluated with spatially distributed SM at a similar spatial resolution, leading to a vague understanding of their pros and cons in the downscaling. In this study, we first implemented a pixel-wise and theoretically calculating of SEE with LST/FVC space and meteorological reanalysis data. Then, a critical evaluation with satellite, aircraft, and in-situ SM observations was made via the SMPAVEX15 and SMAPVEX16 aircraft-based field experiments. Results indicated that the thermal SMIs presented a better performance than the optical SMIs for depicting the variations of SM. Among the thermal SMIs, Ts-based SEE showed better performance than the solo-LST-based index and the composite index temperature-vegetation-soil moisture dryness index (TVMDI). The results demonstrate the validity and necessity of obtaining the Ts-based SEE for downscaling satellite microwave SM with thermal/optical data. The provided pixel-wise method was validated in this study for calculating the T-s-based SEE, which is suggested for future downscaling of satellite microwave SM with microwave and thermal/optical fusion. However, the disadvantages of cloud contamination, the decoupling effect, and uncertainties brought by complex meteorological conditions and reanalysis data urgently need more research efforts.},

	abstract = {A theory of maximum entropy production (MEP) for electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric materials is proposed and applied to simultaneously retrieving soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (VWC) from L-band microwave brightness temperature (TB). One representation of the MEP principle states that a non-equilibrium system corresponds to such a configuration of energy fluxes that minimizes a dissipation function under the constraint of energy conservation. The dissipation function for radiative transfer is formulated as an analogy of that for heat transfer. A new physical parameter, radiative inertia as an analogy of thermal inertia, is introduced to characterize radiative attenuation in dielectric media. The radiative inertia is parameterized in terms of the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves as a function of the complex dielectric constant. The MEP based retrieval algorithm predicts SM and VWC by minimizing the dissipation function under the constraint of the conservation of radiative energy. The retrievals of SM and VWC based on the MEP theory were validated against field observations in tropical and temperate forested regions of the Amazon and North America. The proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates the capability of the MEP algorithm for simultaneous retrievals of SM and VWC even for dense canopy (e.g., VWC {\textgreater} 5 kg m(-2)). The MEP method is a new theoretical framework for developing innovative remote sensing algorithms of the Earth system not limited to microwave observations.},

The results of the uncertainty analysis showed that among the studied models, the vanGenuchten-Mualem model with the indices of S = 0.05, T = 0.4, d-factor = 0.25 and, P-CI = 100 was considered as the most accurate model with the least uncertainty. Also, the results of GSA were demonstrated that alpha and n parameters were sensitive parameters in the models. Consequently, identifying the uncertainty of the SWRC model structure and its parameters, relevant models with higher accuracy can be used in the study of soil water processes, and better water resource allocation.},

The aim of current study is to explore this deficiency. Thus, a field survey and a field experiment were combinedly carried out at Panjin City, China. The field survey with 16 fields each for rice-monoculture (RM) and RC was conducted without influencing conventional cultural practices. The field experiment was conducted with four treatments: rice-monoculture (RM), 3000 crabs ha(-1) without feed (RC3000), 6000 crabs ha(-1) with feed (RC6000), and 12,000 crabs ha(-1) with 2 x feed (RC12000). Results showed an increase in soil nutrients and improved nutrient accumulation in rice with the RC system. Soil organic carbon, macronutrients (nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and magnesium (Mg)), microbial biomass carbon, and nitrogen, micronutrients (copper, zinc (Zn), and manganese) were improved. From the field survey, results indicated significant improvement in grain TN (9.4\%), calcium (Ca, 22.1\%), Mg (7.1\%), and Zn (26.1\%) in RC system compared to RM system. In field experiment, the concentrations of Ca, Mg, and Zn were increased as follows: i) Grain Ca in RC3000 (23.9\%) and RC6000 (17.1\%), ii) Mg in RC3000 (12.6\%), RC6000 (16.3\%), and RC12000 (11.8\%), iii) Zn in RC3000 (10.8\%), RC6000 (5.7\%), and in RC12000 (14.8\%). The RC system has also improved nutrients translocation from soil to plant biomass that was the key reason to increase nutrient composition in rice. The results implied that the improvement of rice yield was by the increased nutrient in soil and the higher nutrient translocation capacity from soil to rice under the proper culturing crab density.

Sixty-two plant leaf samples were collected during a survey carried out in 2019 in farmers' fields. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) concentrations in the leaf samples were analysed. DRIS norms were used to calculate the various paired nutrient ratios in the high-yielding population. Nutrient balance indices (NBI) were also determined. Nutrient requirements based on NBI were ranked according Zn {\textgreater} N {\textgreater} P {\textgreater} Ca {\textgreater} K {\textgreater} Mg, highlighting the importance of Zn and N in soybean nutrition. Paired nutrient ratios (N/P, N/K, Mg/N, N/Ca, Ca/P, K/Ca, Mg/Ca, Zn/Mg) were either significantly (p = 0.0001) higher or lower than those in the literature, excluding Mg/P, Mg/K, P/Zn, Ca/Zn, N/Zn K/Zn and P/K paired ratios. This observation indicates the necessity of calibrating DRIS norms taking into account local conditions and cropping systems. The DRIS model could be an important tool for refining soybean nutrient needs in a cropping system. Zinc and N levels limited soybean cultivation in farmers' fields and must be included in the soybean fertiliser formulations to ensure optimal yield of soybean in Benin.},

In order to accurately understand and continuously observe subsidence areas, this study investigated the spatiotemporal dynamics of mining subsidence using long-term Landsat time-series. The study area was a typical mining region in Shanxi Province, China, with a long history of mining activity. Landsat images from 1986 to 2019, as well as reference data, were used to construct inter-annual time-series trajectories of soil moisture, which were derived from spatial normalizations of the soil moisture monitoring index(SSMMI). The LandTrendr algorithm on the Google Earth Engine platform was then used to extract the subsidence areas and their spatiotemporal dynamics. The results indicate that (i)the map of the spatial distributions of mining subsidence had an overall accuracy of 83.8\% and indicate that areas that underwent subsidence were mainly concentrated in mining cites(including Taiyuan, Lvliang, and Linfen); (ii)subsidence before 1990 accounted for 39.6\% of the total occurrences and a large proportion(45.18\%) of the subsidence was short-term; (iii)subsidence in mountain areas that have long histories of mining and long subsidence durations require further attention by researchers.

	abstract = {Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets, there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices, which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan. The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2\% in volumetric water content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and 297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77\% originates from irrigation.},

	abstract = {The depletion of water resources has gained global attention, particularly in arid climates, where there is growing interest in reusing treated wastewater for irrigation. This study focuses on the impact of irrigating treated wastewater using a hybrid multi-soil-layering (MSL) technology on soil physicochemical properties and the agrophysiological characteristics of maize (Zea mays) cultivated in Morocco, a region characterized by arid conditions. To achieve this research goals, three plots were cultivated with Zea mays and subjected to irrigation with water of varying qualities: raw wastewater (RWW), treated wastewater (TWW), and well water (WW). This experiment ran for five months, covering one crop season. The physicochemical and microbiological parameters in the soil and water were investigated, and the agro-physiological characteristics of the maize crops were assessed. The findings revealed significant differences in physicochemical and microbial parameters within both water and soil, as well as in the physiological responses of the maize crop, among the three water treatments. TWW's quality met the permissible limits for direct wastewater discharge, as prescribed by Moroccan norms, making it suitable for potential irrigation reuse. Moreover, the higher content of key elements (Na, K, Ca, and Mg) in WW indicated that TWW was more suitable for irrigation. Zea mays irrigated with RWW and TWW exhibited a higher accumulation of protein and sugar content compared to WW irrigation. Furthermore, the biomass parameters, including root, aerial, and grain dry weight, showed a positive effect on Zea mays irrigated with RWW and TWW compared to WW. Total chlorophyll content, on the other hand, was highest in plants irrigated with WW, followed by TWW. Plants irrigated with RWW produced the highest amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Conversely, plants irrigated with WW had a higher content of Ca, Na, and Mg. TWW yielded medium concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na compared to RWW and WW, attributed to the nutrients provided by irrigation with TWW using the hybrid MSL technology. In conclusion, aside from their use as irrigation water, treated wastewater emerges as a valuable source of plant nutrients and soil fertilizers. They offer significant nutritive value, enhancing plant growth, reducing the need for additional fertilizer application, lowering mineral fertilization costs, and increasing the productivity of infertile soils. This highlights the potential of treated wastewater to improve agricultural sustainability in arid regions like Morocco.},

To explore the effect of upscaling conversion on SMC monitoring with UAV remote sensing, multispectral images and SMC data at different soil depths were acquired. The multispectral image with an original spatial resolution of 0.1 m was continuously upscaled to 6 m (with a step of 0.1 m and a total of 60 levels). The correlation coefficient method was adopted to determine the optimal scale, and spectral indices at the original and optimal scales were calculated. SMC inversion models at different depths were constructed at the original and optimal scales by multiple linear regression (MLR) and back propagation neural networks (BP), respectively. The results showed that the correlation of UAV multispectral data with SMC displayed a change in first enhancement and then fluctuating weakness with the increase of the upscaled levels. The optimal scale of UAV multispectral remote sensing for monitoring SMC at all soil depths was about 2 m. The BP models were significantly better than the MLR models. For example, in the SMC estimation at 0-20 cm, the RMSE of the BP model was reduced from 0.0110 to 0.0087 (20.9\%). This study can provide theoretical and technical references for improving the accuracy of UAV multispectral remote sensing for SMC monitoring.},

	abstract = {With population growth, water will increase in the following decades tremendously. The optimization of water allocation for agriculture requires accurate soil moisture (SM) monitoring. Recent Global Navigation Satellite System Reflectometry (GNSS-R) studies take advantage of continuously emitted navigation signals by the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) constellations to retrieve spatiotemporal soil moisture changes for soil with high clay content. It presents the advantage of sensing a whole surface around a reference GNSS antenna. This article focuses on sandy SM monitoring in the driest condition observed in the study field of Dahra, (Senegal). The area consists of 95\% sand and in situ volumetric soil moisture (VSM) range from similar to 3\% to similar to 5\% durinf the dry to the rainy season. Unfortunately, the GNSS signals' waves penetrated deep into the soil during the dry period and strongly reduced the accuracy of GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) surface moisture measurements. However, we obtain VSM estimate at low/medium penetration depth. The correlation reaches 0.9 with VSM error lower than 0.16\% for the 5-10-cm-depth probes and achieves excellent temporal monitoring to benefit from the antenna heights directly correlated to spatial resolution. The SM measurement models in our research are potentially valuable tools that contribute to the planning of sustainable agriculture, especially in countries often affected by drought.},

	abstract = {In recent years, biochar has been widely used for soil improvement, but there has been some variation in its effectiveness; the mechanism of regulating nutrient cycling in soil is unclear due to different soil textures and physicochemical properties of biochar. Therefore, in this paper, the effects of different tillage patterns and biochar gradients on the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) and soil nitrogen fixation capacity of soybean were monitored in a phased manner by field trials using 15N isotope tracer technology. The results of the study showed that (1) biochar increases the soil's nitrogen fixation capacity by improving the structural stability of the soil. Total nitrogen (TN) content of the soil increased by 42\% after deep ploughing (DP) application of 500 kg/acre of biochar. (2) Biochar improved the nitrogen use efficiency of soybean plants and increased soybean yield. Compared to that of shallow tillage (SP), deep tillage application of 500 kg/acre of biochar increased the nitrogen use efficiency of soybean by 0.62-3.45\%. 15N isotope tracking technology showed that soybean plants with deep tillage application of 500 kg/acre of biochar had the highest 15N content at flowering stage; compared to no biochar application, the 15N content of root, stem and leaf fractions increased by 65.4-86.9\%. (3) Biochar increased soil CO2 emission fluxes, reduced soil CH4 emission fluxes and soil N2O emission fluxes, with better GHG emission reduction under DP treatment. The regulation model of deep ploughing application of 500kg/acre of biochar provides a reference and guiding meaning for future soil fertility maintenance and farmland soil tillage in black soil areas.},

In this study, the effects of overground rock film mulching (ORFM) on soil water flow behavior, soil water content and temporal and spatial heterogeneity were investigated through a dye tracer test and soil moisture measurement. Moreover, the effects of this technology on the root characteristics of crops (maize and broad bean) were analyzed. The results showed that ORFM treatment significantly increased soil water content and its spatio-temporal heterogeneity by preventing preferential flow at the rock-soil interface. It suggested that this practice can provide a more favorable soil moisture environment for crop growth, which was confirmed by the differences in root characteristics of crops (maize and broad bean) under different treatments in this study. It was found that ORFM treatment reduced the root radial extent of crops but increased the root biomass and root bifurcation rate, which are widely considered to be key factors in improving the efficiency of fine root absorption. Therefore, we believe that ORFM has great potential to improve the effective use of soil water and agricultural water management in karst areas, which is essential for sustainable agricultural development in the region.},

	abstract = {Remote Sensing (RS) offers efficient tools for drought monitoring, especially in countries with a lack of reliable and consistent in-situ multi-temporal datasets. In this study, a novel RS-based Drought Index (RSDI) named Temperature-Vegetation-soil Moisture-Precipitation Drought Index (TVMPDI) was proposed. To the best of our knowledge, TVMPDI is the first RSDI using four different drought indicators in its formulation. TVMPDI was then validated and compared with six conventional RSDIs including VCI, TCI, VIII, TVDI, MPDI and TVMDI. To this end, precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data have been used. Different time scales of meteorological Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) index have also been used for the validation of the RSDIs. TVMPDI was highly correlated with the monthly precipitation and soil temperature in-situ data at 0.76 and 0.81 values respectively. The correlation coeffi-cients between the RSDIs and 3-month SPI ranged from 0.07 to 0.28, identifying the TVMPDI as the most suitable index for subsequent analyses. Since the proposed TVMPDI could considerably outperform the other selected RSDIs, all spatiotemporal drought monitoring analyses in Iran were conducted by TVMPDI over the past 21 years. In this study, different products of the Moderate Resolution Imag-ing Spectrometer (MODIS), Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) datasets containing 15,206 images were used on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) cloud computing platform. According to the results, Iran expe-rienced the most severe drought in 2000 with a 0.715 TVMPDI value lasting for almost two years. Conversely, the TVMPDI showed a minimum value equal to 0.6781 in 2019 as the lowest annual drought level. The drought severity and trend in the 31 provinces of Iran have also been mapped. Consequently, various levels of decrease over the 21 years were found for different provinces, while Isfahan and Gilan were the only provinces showing an ascending drought trend (with a 0.004\% and 0.002\% trendline slope respectively). Khuzestan also faced a worrying drought prevalence that occurred in several years. In summary, this study provides updated information about drought trends in Iran using an advanced and efficient RSDI implemented in the cloud computing GEE platform. These results are ben-eficial for decision-makers and officials responsible for environmental sustainability, agriculture and the effects of climate change. (c) 2021 COSPAR.

	abstract = {Soil moisture content (SMC) acquisition is vital for crop stress diagnosis and precision irrigation. However, UAV remote sensing-based SMC monitoring usually suffers from low accuracy and spatio-temporal applicability. To address these issues, this study integrated crop physiological spectral response features into an ensemble learning model. A two-year field experiment (2022-2023) was conducted. First, fractional-order differentiation (FOD) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) were used to enhance the responsiveness of summer maize canopy spectra to SMC and leaf physiological parameters (LPPs), including leaf area index (LAI), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and leaf water content (LWC). Afterwards, variable importance in projection (VIP) was adopted to characterize the spectral response properties of each parameter. Finally, a stacked ensemble learning model (SELM) based on Bayesian optimization (BO) was used to construct a SMC monitoring model, and the feasibility of fusing LPP spectral response features for SMC monitoring was evaluated. The results indicated that: (1) Changes in SMC had significant effect on LCC and LAI of summer maize, which in T4 (with field water-holding capacity of 80 \%-95 \%) were 14.07\% and 34.41 \% higher than that in T1 (40 \%-50 \%), respectively. (2) Spectral transformation could significantly enhance the correlation between SMC and LPPs with canopy spectra (the average increase of R reached 0.23). (3) Consideration of the crop physiology spectral response could improve the SMC monitoring accuracy, the LCC-FOD-BO-SELM had excellent monitoring performance (R2= 0.78; RMSE = 0.019). The monitoring model fusing LPPs spectral response features had the highest accuracy (R2= 0.81; RMSE = 0.016). (4) BO could significantly reduce the overfitting problem of the monitoring model, with the maximum difference between the R2 of the training and test set after BO being only 0.01), thus improving the model's generalizability. This new approach to SMC monitoring using UAV hyperspectral data provide scientific support for precision agriculture and irrigation.},

The AHP method was used to select the optimal sites using the site-specific criteria. 30.3\% of the catchment area in the Australian Water Resources Assessment Landscape (AWRA-L) Grid\_DC2 can be considered acceptable as representative area with the MIF method. Four potential sites were evaluated for each AWRA-L grid using the relative weights of the site-specific criteria with the AHP method. The Grid\_DC2 required two sites that had the highest overall weight chosen with the AHP analysis. The procedure was repeated for the remaining four AWRA-L grids within the study area to select the required SMM sites.},

	abstract = {Sustainable and resilient cropping intensity is now a global focus to address the food demand and nutrition security of the growing population. For sustainable intensification, maintaining soil fertility is a key concern. The nutrient management for the recently developed four crop-based cropping system in Bangladesh has not yet been studied. Hence, field experiments were conducted on the nutrient management of the four crop-based cropping system [Aus (pre-monsoon rice), Aman (monsoon rice), lentil, and mungbean] in calcareous soil in Bangladesh during the years of 2016/17 and 2017/18 to determine the appropriate fertilizer management package to improve crop productivity and sustain soil fertility. The experiment had six treatments assigned in a randomized complete block design with three replications. The treatments included T-1 = control (without synthetic fertilizer), T-2 = 50\% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF), T-3 = 75\% RDF, T-4 = 100\% RDF, T-5 = 125\% RDF, and T-6 = farmers' practice (FP). The results revealed that the 125\% RDF significantly contributed to higher yields of all four crops. The rice equivalent yield (REY) was the highest for the fertilizer management of 125\% RDF, which was 45.5\%, 9.4\%, and 12.2\% higher than the control (T-1), 100\% RDF (T-4), and FP, respectively. Considering the uptake of nutrients (N, P, K, S, Zn, and B) by the crops in the cropping system, the 125\% RDF was superior to the other treatments. The nutrient management practices had a positive influence on the apparent nutrient recovery (ANR) efficiency of the cropping system. The fertilizer management of 125\% RDF was also economically more profitable due to the increment in the cost-benefit ratio of 26.8\%, 4.4\%, and 4.9\% over the control, 100\% RDF, and FP, respectively. The results indicate that the current fertilizer recommendations and FP for aus, aman, lentil, and mungbean are not adequate for the change from the three crop to the four crop-based pattern, and an increased dose of fertilizer is required to increase the yield of each individual crop as well as the total system's productivity. The fertilizer use efficiency is also higher for 125\% RDF than the 100\% RDF and FP indicating that to sustain the soil fertility in the four crop-based system, the current RDF and FP are not sufficient. This finding will help intensive cropping areas in preventing nutrient deficiencies that would lead to a reduction in the crop yield.},

Similarly, significantly improved level of soil test phosphorus STP was observed at the end of the sixth crop season and INM techniques resulted in a 429\% to 453\% increase in STP. However, statistical analysis revealed a non-significant effect of doses, and a significant declining effect on soil K was observed with the applied technique of only mineral fertilizer application. Highly negative K balance suggests that the system will not be able to sustain the long-term supply of K.

In 2005, 20 farmers operating on 30 plots were randomly selected from the Bilpabla village of Khulna from whom prawn and MV rice production data were collected using a questionnaire; soil samples were also collected and tested. In 2011 and 2017, the sustainability of the gher system over time was assessed through another survey of farmers following the same methodology. Results revealed that although the nominal income from gher farming increased by 59 percent in 2011 and 23 percent in 2017, the real income and per capita household income remained unchanged over time. Agricultural income has contributed about 65 percent to household income, which for gher farmers was about 200 percent higher than average rural incomes in Bangladesh. Rice productivity declined slightly from its 2005 level. However, the productivity of MV rice under prawn-rice gher farming is substantially higher than in the conventional MV rice farming system. The positive estimates of the Mean Soil Quality Index and Soil Degradation Index for land used for MV paddy production within the gher indicate an increase in soil nutrients. This suggests that the joint prawn-rice gher farming system is relatively sustainable, having improved soil fertility and stabilized real income. Policy implications toward promoting agricultural growth in the southwestern region of Bangladesh include research on developing varieties of MV rice suited to prawn-rice gher farming and the development of commercial feeds and markets for prawn to further raise productivity and incomes of gher farmers.},

The solubility of slag may be higher than that of lime, which can make this residue an excellent source for soil acidity correction in no-till systems. However, there are few studies reporting their benefits when applied to the soil surface. This study evaluated slag amendment effects on soil chemical attributes and on the yield and nutrient uptake of soybean following surface application and/or incorporation of different types of slag, in comparison to lime, on a tropical, acidic soil under a no-till system. The trial was performed in Botucatu, SP, Brazil. Six soil-acidity corrective materials were incorporated or surface-applied, including steel slag, ladle slag, stainless-steel slag, wollastonite, dolomitic lime, and calcined dolomitic lime, plus a negative control. Each material dose was calculated to raise the base saturation to 70\%. Slags can be applied in a no-tillage system with efficiency similar to that of lime for the neutralization of soil acidity, for adequate nutrition and yield of the soybean crop. Slags and limes showed similar effects on increased pH, decreased Al3+ concentration, and increased base saturation up to the 0.40 and 0.20-m soil layers at 12 and 23 months, respectively, after the application of treatments, regardless of surface or incorporated application. The by-product application has an additional advantage, depending on the type of slag, that is the provision of phosphorus and/or silicon.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable that contributes for flux partitioning into sensible and latent heat components. There is a pressing need to study the impacts of shallow groundwater table dynamics on antecedent soil moisture and corresponding feedbacks to atmosphere. In this study, we evaluate WRF-NoahMP simulated soil moisture using two experimental configurations: one with the default, free drainage approach (CTL) and with Miguez-Macho groundwater scheme (GW). Results are presented for the study conducted over Ganga River basin, India between the years 2008 and 2014 for all the three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). It was observed that the GW model runs, improve soil moisture in topmost and bottom-most layers. We discovered that the simulations improved temporal negative bias of seasonal accumulation during monsoon by around 91 mm. In addition, the average negative bias in latent heat flux improved by around 28 W/m(2). Compared to CTL, GW was found to contribute additional atmospheric moisture content ranging between 3\% and 5\%. Comparison with in-situ ground water showed that model overestimates the ground water table depth. This can be attributed to the ability of the model to only simulate natural occurring variabilities and lack of inclusion of anthropogenic factors such as ground water pumping in the model. The groundwater trend in Ganga is declining at alarming rate. In addition, if over exploitation of groundwater is not monitored properly, water and food scarcity is an imminent threat to the country's economy. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to be implemented over Ganga basin, which evaluates the role of shallow ground water table on regional climate using coupled atmosphere-land surface-groundwater model. In summary, we highlight that the groundwater component along with WRF-NoahMP coupled model improves soil moisture and precipitation representation over the Ganga basin.},

However, the accuracy of existing electrochemical sensors is hurdled by the immobility of targeted ions, ion adsorption to soil particles, and sensor reading noise and drifting over time. In this study, polyacrylamide hydrogel with a thickness of 0.45 mu m was coated on the surface of solid-state ion-selective membrane (S-ISM) sensors to absorb water contained in soil and, consequently, enhance the accuracy (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.98) and stability (drifting {\textless} 0.3 mV/h) of these sensors monitoring ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3-) ions in soil. An ion transport model was built to simulate the long-term NH4+ dynamic process (R-2 {\textgreater} 0.7) by considering the soil adsorption process and soil complexity. Furthermore, a soil-based denoising data processing algorithm (SDDPA) was developed based on the unique features of soil sensors including the nonlinear mass transfer and ion diffusion on the heterogeneous sensor-hydrogel-soil interface. The 14 day tests using real- world soil demonstrated the effectiveness of S-DDPA to eliminate false signals and retrieve the actual soil nitrogen information for accurate (error: {\textless}2 mg/L) and continuous monitoring.},

There is also limited research on the effects of biochar on AM colonization, cucumber yield, and soil fertility improvement. Therefore, this investigation aimed to determine the impact of poultry litter biochar (PLB) on colonization of roots by indigenous AM fungi in agricultural soil and their contribution to cucumber yield, nutrition, and soil fertility improvement. A field trial was conducted to assess the effect of PLB combined with compound poultry manure (CPM) and nitrophos (NP) fertilizer to investigate the response of treatments on nutrient-deficient sandy soils. Plant growth responses to biochar showed better plant growth and yield of cucumber. Application of biochar with and without CPM and NP reduced the negative impact of nutrient deficiency stress on cucumber growth. AM fungal colonization, soil fertility, and cucumber yield were improved with the combined application of biochar, CPM, and NP fertilizer. Post-harvest, soil C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, S, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn increased with application of biochar applied with CPM and NP. Biochar application with CPM and NP also increased the percent root colonization of cucumber. Use of biochar with CPM and NP has the potential to improve plant growth, yield, nutrient uptake, and soil fertility. Further studies in various agro-ecological conditions would help utilize this technology in sustainable crop production.},

A three-year turfgrass irrigation research trial (2019-2021) using tertiary -treated recycled water (mean EC = 1.18 dS/m, pH = 7.5) was conducted in Irvine, California, USA. A total of 12 irrigation treatments were designed, including six soil moisture -based thresholds (for triggering and terminating irrigation events) x two irrigation frequency treatments (restricted versus on -demand). Weekly NDVI and canopy temperature data were collected during the summer irrigation season to assess the impact of irrigation treatments on the overall health and quality of `Tifgreen 328' hybrid bermudagrass. Soil salinity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) were measured before and after the summer irrigation seasons. Findings revealed statistically significant effects of irrigation levels and irrigation frequency restrictions on NDVI over the three years. The temperature difference (dT) between turfgrass and air (Tc - Ta) was significantly affected by irrigation levels throughout the three years, while irrigation frequency restrictions showed a significant effect in the years 2021 and 2022. On -demand irrigation resulted in a 10\% reduction in temperature difference values during the study period compared to restricted irrigation. Variations in soil salinity levels were observed during the experimental periods; however, both salinity and SAR increased as the study progressed. Results indicate that fully autonomous hybrid bermudagrass irrigation with recycled water, based on recommended soil moisture thresholds of 75\% of field capacity over an extended period in a semiarid climate, may lead to unacceptable turfgrass quality.},

	abstract = {Soils are one of the main terrestrial carbon sinks and contain more carbon than the combined total in the atmosphere and terrestrial vegetation. A major challenge is quantifying how much carbon is stored in the soil and how much it has been sequestered due to changed management practices. In this study, a visible and near-infrared (VisNIR) penetrometer system was developed to measure in-situ soil VisNIR reflectance spectra to a depth of 90 cm into the soil profile. A spectral library of VisNIR soil spectra collected in airdry and ground states were used to calibrate Cubist regression models for estimating soil organic carbon (SOC) contents. The External Parameter Orthogonalisation (EPO) transformation was applied to the in-situ spectra to remove soil moisture and other in-situ effects from the spectra. This penetrometer system was used to estimate SOC contents at three sites on three different days under variable soil moisture states. The penetrometer EPO performed better compared to the EPO constructed from moist cores. After applying EPO transformation matrix, soil wetness did not have any influence on soil SOC content estimations. The SOC contents were estimated using the in-situ VisNIR system were validated against lab-measured SOC content with mean R2, RMSE, and bias of 0.88, 0.32\%, and 0.15\%, respectively. It is concluded that the VisNIR penetrometer can potentially be used to measure SOC content rapidly and cost-effectively in-situ with a fine depth resolution.(c) 2022 IAgrE.

	abstract = {Background and AimsSelection effect (SE) and complementarity effect (CE) are often considered as two key indicators to mediate the positive diversity-productivity relationship in the maize-legume intercropping system, as intercropping generally enables crops to use the available resources more efficiently than monoculture. Yet, it is unclear whether soil moisture drives the SE and CE transformation, plant-plant interaction, and accordingly affect the productivity.MethodsA two-year field experiment was conducted to explore the impacts of soil water status (with and without plastic mulching) on interspecific interaction and productivity and its key mechanism in the maize-faba bean intercropping system.ResultsLow soil moisture reduced the net effect (NE) and land equivalent ratio (LER) with evident yield loss (NE {\textless} 0 and LER = 1.05), whereas the improved soil moisture reversed this trend and resulted in overyielding (NE {\textgreater} 0 and LER = 1.13). Regardless of soil moisture, faba bean was the dominant species and maize was the inferior one. Low soil moisture promoted the contribution of SE to productivity (P {\textless} 0.05). In contrast, high moisture turned to lower the competition intensity of faba bean against maize and accordingly promote the transformation of biodiversity effect from SE to CE. The main mechanism was that the water competition imposed by faba bean strips on maize ones decreased the NE through reducing photosynthetic rate and water use efficiency of maize.ConclusionThe adaptive transitions of interspecific relationship and the biodiversity effect were driven by soil water availability. This novel phenomenon should be emphasized in the crop diversity management of intercropping system in the rainfed region.},

The soil organic carbon, labile organic carbon, inorganic N, available phosphorus, and available potassium under straw return treatments were significantly higher than RT in the 0-30 cm soil layer (p {\textless} 0.05). The microbial diversity, invertase, urease, and alkaline phosphatase activities also increased when maize straw was returned. Tillage practices could distribute maize straw in different depths of the soil and then affect soil nutrients, enzyme activity, and microbial diversity. The RS treatment presented the greatest effects in the 0-10 cm layer, while more significant impacts were observed in DS and RS/DS treatments at the 10-30 cm depths. The levels of soil nutrients and enzyme activity increased with an increased N rate. Compared to that under LN, wheat yields increased under HN and MN treatments, whereas there were no significant differences between HN and MN (p {\textgreater} 0.05). An increasing tendency of grain yield was observed in DS and RS/DS, while conversely so in RS. RS/DS had lower farm costs than DS during the study duration. Thus, RS/DS at 225 kg N ha(-1) is the best method for improving soil fertility and wheat yield.},

There is a threshold value of the soil saturation, below and above which the sensitivity of flood peak to the soil moisture differentiates substantially; (2) For model spin-up, streamflow needs longer time to reach the `practical' equilibrium (10\%) than the soil moisture and latent heat flux. The model uncertainty from spin-up can propagate through the hydrometeorological modelling chain and get amplified into the flood peak; (3) For ensemble flood modelling with a hydrometeorological system, modelling uncertainty is dominated by the precipitation forecast.

We also conducted an incubation experiment to investigate the direct effect of liming on soil available P and phosphatase activities on paddy soils in the absence of plants. In the incubation experiment, liming reduced soil P availability (measured as Olsen-extractable P) by 14-17\% and inhibited the activity of soil acid phosphatase. Nonetheless, lime application increased grain yield, biomass, and P uptake in the field. Liming increased grain yield and P uptake more strongly for late rice (26 and 21\%, respectively) than for early rice (15 and 8\%, respectively). Liming reduced the concentration of soil available P in the field as well, reflecting the increase in rice P uptake and the direct negative effect of liming on soil P availability. Taken together, these results suggest that by stimulating rice growth, liming can overcome direct negative effects on soil P availability and increase plant P uptake in this acidic paddy soil where P is not the limiting factor.},

To clarify this issue, a maize-grass pea intercropping system was investigated in a rainfed field with P addition (P0 and P +), water (rain-fed and plastic film mulching) and isolation (root barrier and root intermingling) treatments. The data indicated that total net effect was higher than 0 under all the conditions, displaying facilitative effects of biodiversity on agroecosystem productivity. The dynamics of total land equivalent ratio demonstrated that the intensity of plant-plant facilitation became greater under P-deficient condition. Maize was the facilitated species consistently, while grass pea changed from facilitated species under low soil P and moisture to facilitator under high soil P and moisture. The driving mechanism was associated with soil acidi-fication and microbial community promotion effect under P-deficient condition. Intercropped rhizosphere soil phosphatase activity was increased by 4.9-17.2\%, and Olsen-P availability was evidently enhanced relative to monoculture. Interestingly, drought stress significantly enhanced this trend. Critically, root isolation confirmed that plant-plant facilitation was briefly driven by interspecific rhizosphere interactions. Conclusively, this study confirmed the context-dependent facilitation shift in agroecosystem and provided a novel insight into the importance of rhizosphere interaction on soil P availability and utilization.},

Optical remote sensing has been widely used to estimate SM with relatively fine spatial resolution. However, optical observations are easily contaminated by clouds, making it difficult to obtain spatially continuous SM over large regions. In the present study, a semimonthly SM dataset over the study area of the entire Inner Mongolia region with nearly full spatial coverage was derived from the synergistic use of China's Feng-Yun (FY) geostationary (FY-4A) and polar-orbit (FY-3D) observations, following a previously developed trapezoid feature space in a pixel-to-pixel manner. A preliminary assessment was conducted to evaluate the performances of the proposed method over two main dominant land cover types (grassland and cropland) in the study region, where the China Meteorological Administration Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) and the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) SM products were provided as references. The results indicated that the estimated SM was well correlated to the referenced SM datasets, with a significant correlation coefficient varying from 0.5 to 0.8. Furthermore, for the grassland (cropland), unbiased root mean square errors of approximately 0.062 (0.097) m(3)/m(3) and 0.055 (0.069) m(3)/m(3) can be found when comparing the estimated SM with the CLDAS and the SMAP product, respectively.},

The lobe differencing correlation radiometer (LDCR) on a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) is shown to provide a capability to measure soil moisture at high spatial resolution for a range of scientific and operational purposes. Flight tests of LDCR on a fixed wing sUAS were performed at the Canton, Oklahoma Soilscape site in September 2015, and Irrigation Research Foundation (IRF) in Yuma, Colorado, in June 2016. The LDCR design and performance are discussed, and the calibration using both preflight lab test data and in-flight data over a calm pond was performed to calibrate the radiometer. Radio frequency interference (RFI) from the sUAS platform was observed and mitigated. The LDCR sampling processes are detailed and an implementation of the tau - omega vegetation correction model along with a semiempirical surface roughness correction model incorporating a full-domain soil moisture mapping algorithm is presented. The algorithm uses a weakly nonlinear observation operator suitable for irregular sUAS flight trajectories that maps volumetric soil moisture (VSM) on a user-defined product grid from the sUAS sampling grid. Using LDCR radiometric and thermal measurements, along with Landsat-based vegetation water content (VWC) and soil texture information, soil moisture was mapped at decameter spatial resolution. The retrieved VSM data are favorably compared with in situ VSM measurements and irrigation records. A method for determining LDCR VSM estimation errors is developed to quantify the mapping algorithm accuracy and assess the impact of error sources.},

We describe a study to validate and improve soil moisture content retrieval and mapping from hyperspectral imagery collected by a UAS system. Our approach uses a recently developed model known as the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance (MARMIT). MARMIT partitions contributions due to water and the sediment surface into equivalent but separate layers and describes these layers using an equivalent slab model formalism. The model water layer thickness along with the fraction of wet surface become parameters that must be optimized in a calibration step, with extinction due to water absorption being applied in the model based on equivalent water layer thickness, while transmission and reflection coefficients follow the Fresnel formalism. In this work, we evaluate the model in both field settings, using UAS hyperspectral imagery, and laboratory settings, using hyperspectral spectra obtained with a goniometer. Sediment samples obtained from four different field sites representing disparate environmental settings comprised the laboratory analysis while field validation used hyperspectral UAS imagery and coordinated ground truth obtained on a barrier island shore during field campaigns in 2018 and 2019. Analysis of the most significant wavelengths for retrieval indicate a number of different wavelengths in the short-wave infra-red (SWIR) that provide accurate fits to measured soil moisture content in the laboratory with normalized root mean square error (NRMSE){\textless} 0.145, while independent evaluation from sequestered test data from the hyperspectral UAS imagery obtained during the field campaign obtained an average NRMSE = 0.169 and median NRMSE = 0.152 in a bootstrap analysis.},

Prior to the coupling, the WRF-Hydro model is calibrated using streamflow data at different data scales (i.e. hourly and daily) to discuss the influences of the changing temporal resolution of the reference dataset on the optimum parameter values. According to the results, fully coupled models correct the location and magnitude of the occurrence of hourly extreme precipitation. Changing the initial soil moisture data source affects the terrestrial water cycle elements in the semi-arid region (i.e. Mediterranean (MED)) more than in the humid area (i.e. Eastern Black Sea (EBS)), especially in spring and summer. The initiation of the coupled model with satellite-based soil moisture improves the streamflow outputs after a reasonable spin-up period for the MED region.},

The precise management of agricultural ET helps optimize water resource usage in arid and semiarid regions and requires field-scale ET data support. Due to the combined limitations of satellite sensors and ET mechanisms, the current high-resolution ET models need further refinement to meet the demands of field-scale ET management. In this research, we proposed a new field-scale ET estimation method by developing an allocation factor to quantify field-level ET variations and allocate coarse ET to the field scale. By regarding the agricultural field as the object of the ET parcel, the allocation factor is calculated with combined high-resolution remote sensing indexes indicating the field-level ET variations under different crop growth and land-surface water conditions. The allocation ET results are validated at two ground observation stations and show improved accuracy compared with that of the original coarse data. This allocated ET model provides reasonable spatial results of field-level ET and is adequate for precise agricultural ET management. This allocation method provides new insight into calculating field-level ET from coarse ET datasets and meets the demands of wide application for controlling regional water consumption, supporting the ET management theory in addressing the impacts of water scarcity on social and economic developments.},

There are currently two basic methodologies in the downscaling with satellite datasets, i.e., the machine learning (ML) methods and the physical or semiphysical (PH) models. This study focuses on exploring feasible ways to integrate them for boosting the performance of downscaling. Here, three parallel modes, i.e., arithmetic average (Ari), geometric average (Geo), and weighted average (Wei), and two series modes, i.e., first PH then ML ( PH-ML) and first ML then PH (ML-PH), were developed and evaluated. A representative of PH, DSCALE\_mod16, and three ML algorithms, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and LightGBM, were used in this study. Microwave SM datasets from SM Active and Passive (SMAP) Mission, satellite datasets from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), and in situ SM observations spanning from April 2015 to December 2018 were employed in the evaluation. Spatial dynamic range, energy conservation, and precision preservation analyses were conducted as evaluation methods. Results demonstrated that the PH-ML series mode outperformed the other coupling modes, which was even better than the better one of the PH and ML. The PH can first generate a valuable initial estimate, and the initial estimate's advantages can be preserved, while its errors can be suppressed by the ML. Resultantly, the ideology of first using the PH to obtain an initial estimate and then putting the initial estimate into the ML is suggested for further microwave SM downscaling.},

One of the most suitable approach to do this over vegetated areas is the Land Surface Temperature - Vegetation Index (LST-VI) Triangle Method. This method estimates water content in soil which is available for plants in contrast to methods using satellite observations in the microwave band, and it is superior to pixel by pixel soil moisture methods using observations in the optical band which neglect statistical relationship between VI and LST controlling evapotranspiration on vegetated area. This study tested a methodological modification of the method based on assumption that evapotranspiration depends on the difference between the air temperature and the terrain surface temperature. The spatial distribution of Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Indices, which reflect soil moisture in the root zone was calculated for vast areas of Central Europe using the classic Triangle Method and its modified version. Both NDVI and EVI indices were used as input data in these calculations. The air temperature at 2 m height was taken from SYNOP reports, and the terrain surface temperature from MODIS data. In addition, Matlab scripts were written by the authors to allow convenient access to free SYNOP data. Our results indicate that proposed modification increases the accuracy of soil moisture estimation. This was confirmed by comparing classic and modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Indices values with rainfall data.},

	abstract = {Data sets provided by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite missions contain rich information about land surface hydrologic processes.In this study, a unified regression method is proposed and applied to these global data sets to investigate surface soil moisture (SSM) dynamics. Two forms of regressors are implemented: 1) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation flux and 2) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation flux with an additional interaction term. Regression results based on 3 years of global SMAP and GPM data show that the unified regression method can identify the SSM characteristics found by several recent studies, including the SSM exponential decay rate, the fraction of precipitation retained in the surface soil layer, and the effective depth of hydrologic storage. Additionally, including the interaction regressor provides a novel way to derive the sensitivity of infiltration/runoff partitioning to antecedent SSM without the need for streamflow observations. These SMAP/GPM regression results are compared with those derived from a global SSM data set simulated by the variable infiltration capacity model. Relative to the satellite data, variable infiltration capacity retains moisture longer in the top layer, retains too much precipitation input in that layer, and exhibits levels of sensitivity of runoff/infiltration partitioning to top-layer soil moisture that generally match SMAP especially in humid regions. This study demonstrates that the regression-based method can recover useful process-level insight from SMAP SSM retrievals and is a viable tool for evaluating the representation of surface processes in hydrologic models. Plain Language Summary In the past few years, new satellite missions have been launched to make frequent observations of near-surface soil moisture and rainfall over most global land areas. In this study, we analyze these satellite observations to learn how near-surface soil moisture changes over time. Based on this analysis, we can determine for each location: 1) how fast near-surface soil moisture declines after rainfall, 2) how much rainfall enters the soil versus how much runs off, and 3) how rainfall partitioning is affected by near-surface soil moisture. The first two questions have been studied before, but our method is simpler and reaches the same conclusions. Our method is also able to answer the third question, which has not been looked at before. Finally, we analyze a model-based near-surface soil moisture data set in the same way and compare the results with our observation-based finding. In this way, we pinpoint aspects of the mathematical model that do not correctly mimic the real-world evolution of near-surface soil moisture. This insight will guide model upgrades that better capture reality.},

	abstract = {As a crucial parameter in land surface systems, soil moisture plays an important role in surface energy balance studies, environmental detection, and global climate change research. Remotely sensed data have been used for estimating soil moisture through different approaches, which has resulted in many achievements. Previous studies showed that the land surface temperature (LST) vegetation index method (LST-VI method) can obtain surface soil moisture with remote sensing sources, and it is relatively simple and easy to operate at a regional scale. However, one thorny difficulty is the dry edge determination from the LST-VI feature space. In this study, a remote sensing method is proposed to determine the theoretical dry edge from the LST-VI scatter plots, which do not require any ground measured auxiliary data. Based on the surface energy balance principle, this method derived the maximum LSTs for bare soil and full vegetation cover using MODIS products. The air temperature is parameterized by the LST using a semiempirical formula as the theoretical wet edge. The estimated soil moisture is validated by in situ measurements at a comprehensive weather station of Yucheng. The coefficient of determination is similar to 0.60, and the root mean square error is about 0.08 m(3)/m(3). The relevant key parameters in determining the dry edge are also validated from the meteorological observation. The air temperature and net surface shortwave radiation flux all reach a very high level, with an RMSE of 3.75 k and 49.3 W m(-2), respectively. The results demonstrated that the proposed method can derive the accurate dry edge to estimate soil moisture from the remote sensing data, which will provide great help for future studies of soil moisture estimation using remote sensing techniques.

	abstract = {Soil moisture operational product system (SMOPS) is developed by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide the real-time blended soil moisture (SM) for numeric weather prediction and national water model applications. However, all individual satellite SM data ingested into the current operational SMOPS are scaled to global land data assimilation system (GLDAS) 0-10 cm SM climatology before the combination. As a result, the useful information from the original microwave SM retrievals could be lost, and the GLDAS model errors could be brought into the final SMOPS blended product. In this paper, we propose to scale the individual SM retrievals to the soil moisture active passive (SMAP) data through building regression models. The rescaled individual SM data and the SMAP observations then have similar climatology and dynamics, which allows producing the SMOPScdr (distinguishing with the current operational SMOPSopr) data using an equal-weight averaging approach. With respect to the in situ SM measurements, the developed SMOPScdr is more successful tracking the surface SM status than the individual satellite SM products with significantly decreased errors. The proposed method also preserves the climatology of the reference SMAP data for the period when SMAP is not available, allowing us to produce a long-term SMOPScdr data product.},

	abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) is controlled by several environmental factors. However, it is unclear how these factors and their interactions affect soil N fractions (SNFs) because of the lack of systematic N extraction methods. The Harbin-Dali belt, a transect more than 3,300 km long across China covering various climates, topographies, soil parent materials and vegetation types, was taken as the study area, and the interactive effects on SNFs in largely undisturbed woodlands and grasslands were explored using three SNFs: labile N, moderately stable N and stable N. The soil N fractions were obtained through a novel sequential extraction method that used distilled H2O, 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 M HCl, 6 M HCl, mixed acid (1 M HCl and 5 M HF; MA), concentrated HCl (cHCl) and concentrated H2SO4 as extractive agents to successively separate H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl-, 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N fractions. The results showed that increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) directly decreased the concentrations of H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N, suggesting that warming may reduce available N. The interactions between MAT, parent material, aspect and aridity index also contributed to the three SNFs. Vegetation and its interactions with parent material primarily controlled 6 M HCl-, cHCl- and RES-N, and climate and topography had indirect effects during these processes. Particularly, more cHCl- and RES-N were accumulated in areas with warm humid climates and rich vegetation species than in other environments. Moreover, soil labile N (H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N) and cHCl-N exhibited potential as sensitive indicators for reflecting the changes in MAT and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, the various interactions between climate and other environmental factors controlled the changes in most SNFs. This novel sequential extraction method thus offers a reliable analytical approach to measuring SNFs. Highlights Soil nitrogen fractions (SNFs) were fractionated via a novel sequential extraction method. Increasing MAT decreased the H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N concentrations. Interactions of climate, parent material and vegetation affected 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N. H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl- and cHCl-N are sensitive SNFs that reflect environmental changes.},

Complementary to these continuous measurements, numerous campaign-based activities provided data by mobile CRNS roving, hyperspectral im-agery via UASs, intensive manual sampling of soil properties (SWC, bulk density, organic matter, texture, soil hydraulic properties), and observations of biomass and snow (cover, depth, and density).

In this study, a double-scale analysis on the detectability of the irrigation occurrence over an area in central Italy through remote sensing soil moisture is proposed; the period of interest is a 3-year time span from 2017 to 2019. The detectability of district- or sub-district-scale irrigation signals through remotely sensed soil moisture data is investigated at two different spatial resolutions: 1 km and plot scale. Three soil moisture products sampled at 1 km resolution are evaluated: a DISPATCH (DISaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale CHange) downscaled version of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) and two Sentinel-1-derived products, namely the 1 km version delivered by Copernicus and a plot-scale-born version developed by THEIA and aggregated at 1 km. The THEIA Sentinel-1 product aggregated at 100 m is used in the plot-scale analysis. Over the study area, the irrigation extent is determined by the fragmentation of the agricultural fields and the complex topography, making the adoption of plot-scale data necessary. Satisfactory results are obtained by comparing maps of irrigated areas at 100 m spatial resolution produced through the k-means clustering algorithm with ground-truth data, since the method fails only once out of seven in properly reproducing the irrigated or non-irrigated conditions occurred over four pilot agricultural fields.},

Similarly, the findings show that slight to mild droughts have a great chance of occurrence in Gamo Zone. The data also demonstrate that normal difference vegetation index has a strong relationship with land surface temperature (R = - 0.95), precipitation (R = 0.65) and soil moisture (R = 0.85), indicating that normal difference vegetation index is more sensitive to land surface temperature than soil moisture and precipitation, although soil moisture has a positive relationship with precipitation (R = 0.60). Therefore, this study revealed that normal difference vegetation index and vegetation condition index indices are suitable for agricultural drought monitoring and they are strongly associated with precipitation, soil moisture and land surface temperature. This study shall be helpful for decision makers to take the necessary measures by considering the drought risk maps for early warning system and future drought management plans.},

In this study, the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) soil moisture and the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM-IMERG) were used in flood modeling in Moroccan ungauged basins (Bourrous, Al Wiza, El Hallouf and Jamala). We started with comparing GPM-IMERG Early with ground measurements from five rain gauges. Next, the Soil Conservation Service - Curve Number (SCS-CN) was applied with ground precipitation measurements, LPRM and GPM-IMERG Early datasets to simulated flood events in a gauged basin, the Ghdat. Finally, this SCS-CN model was transposed with these satellite data sets validated to those ungauged basins in order to reproduce flood events. The results show that the GPM-IMERG Early is best with in situ measurements (correlation coefficient = 0.50; relative bias = 27.51\%; probability of detection = 0.77; false alarm rate = 0.23), on a daily scale. The observed precipitation, LPRM and GPM-IMERG Early were performed well in validation to simulate floods in the Ghdat, where Nash-Sutcliffe criterion range from 0.43 and 0.98 using the SCS-CN model. For Bourrous, Al Wiza, El Hallouf and Jamala all flood events and hydrographs were reproduced by GPM-IMERG Early and LPRM products. Furthermore, LPRM products were validated against soil moisture measurements with a coefficient of determine R-2 between 0.72 and 0.84. The results of this work provided interesting insights for flood modeling using GPM-IMERG and LPRM satellite products in ungauged basins.},

However, when multiple hydrologic units are present within its footprint, the potential application of CRNS in water resources management is restricted. Here we propose a new strategy to predict point-scale SWC in root zone established on CRNS-based soil moisture and improved relative difference method. A total of 768 days of soil moisture data were collected by CRNS at the intermediate scale and EC-TM sensors at the point scale in a karst catchment. The original and improved mean relative difference methods predicted point-scale SWCs within and without the effective measuring depth, respectively. The mean effective measuring depth was 13.16 cm, ranging from 10.13 to 19.23 cm. Both land use type and soil structure played essential roles in regulating point scale SWC in the soil profile. Point-scale SWC in root zone can be predicted accurately (P {\textless} 0.001) based on SWC data derived from the CRNS system. The prediction accuracy of point scale SWC can be improved by increasing the averaging time of the soil moisture values. Our results demonstrated that the proposed strategy was reliable for CRNS to predict SWC beyond the effective measurement depth. This study provides a good perspective for effectively managing of water resources in areas with complex hydrological processes.},

In this study, a geographical weighted regression (GWR) model, a multiple stepwise regression (MLSR) model, and a boosted regression trees (BRT) model were compared to obtain the best prediction of SOC and STN stocks of the forest ecosystems in northeastern China. Five-hundred and thirteen topsoil (0-30 cm) samples (10.32 kg m(-2) (+/- 0.53) for SOC, 1.21 kg m(-2) (+/- 0.32) for STN), and 9 remotely-sensed environmental variables were collected and used for the model development and verification. By comparing with independent verification data, the best model (BRT) achieved R-2 = 0.56 and root mean square error (RMSE) = 00.85 kg m(-2) for SOC stocks, R-2 = 0.51 and RMSE = 0.22 kg m(-2) for STN stocks. Of all the remotely-sensed environment variables, soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) are of the highest relative importance in predicting SOC and STN stocks. The spatial distribution of the predicted SOC and STN stocks gradually decreased from northeast to southwest. This study provides an attempt to rapidly predict SOC and STN stocks in the dense vegetation covered area.

Canopy hyperspectral data of WSR was obtained; meanwhile, duplex PCR was used to measure the content of Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Pst) in the same canopy section. The content of Pst corresponded to its spectrum as the classification label of the model, which is established by discriminant partial least squares (DPLS) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. In the spectral region of 325-1075 nm, the model's average recognition accuracy was between 75\% and 80\%. In the sub-band of 325-1075 nm, the average recognition accuracy of the DPLS was 80\% within the 325-474 nm. The average recognition accuracy of the SVM was 83\% within the 475-624 nm. Correlation analysis showed that the disease index of WSR was positively correlated with soil nitrogen nutrition, indicating that the soil nitrogen nutrition would affect the severity of WSR during the latent period.},

	abstract = {Recently, emphasis has been placed on finding a reliable estimation of soil water content. In this study, two capacitance sensors EC5 and 5TE (METER Group) were utilized. These sensors provide many benefits relative to other sensors in that they are cost-effective and very economical regarding energy use, operate at a high measurement frequency of 70 MHz, and are dedicated to measuring at a small volume because of their small size. This makes them suitable for the context of use in this research, which consists of multiple sustainable drainage systems SuDS. Several studies have evaluated these two types of sensor but not for urban soils with specific characteristics. In addition, results from the literature are divergent and the published calibration data are limited. Therefore, an in-depth investigation of their accuracy is assessed in this paper. At first, the literature's existing procedures and methods were examined. The sensor-to-sensor variability, as well as repeatability, were tested in soil and solutions. Additionally, a field calibration method was conducted to estimate the effects of soil texture on sensors readings. Two laboratory calibration methods having different principles were also applied, compared to each other and to the field calibration as well. Results revealed weak sensor-to-sensor variability (coefficient of variation up to 15\% in soil) and also good repeatability (0.1\%), for both sensors. A soil-specific calibration equation has improved the estimation of the volumetric water content. In case of soil having high field bulk density, the undisturbed soil calibration method described and proposed in this paper gives promising results. The latter method yields a volumetric water content (VWC) prediction accuracy of 0.025 m(3)center dot m(-3) on a sandy loam soil. This paper presents a large knowledge of capacitance sensors measurement technique as well as their calibration procedures and methods. Limitations of existing procedures have been identified and key elements for selecting the appropriate one are suggested. Derived calibration equations have also been provided for three urban soils with different particle size distribution, ranging from sandy loam to silt loam. Accurate monitoring of soil moisture content in urban soils is thus achievable.},

Two-year field trials were conducted with the objective of computing the effect of different rates, time, method, and source of potassium (K) fertilization on nutrient recovery efficiency, nutrient balance, and system productivity in a dry direct-seeded RWCS with eight treatments. The two-split (half basal and half at panicle initiation) application of 60 kg K2O/ha resulted in 37.5\% and 19.2\% increase in recovery efficiency of K in rice and wheat, respectively over basal application of 60 kg K2O/ha. Besides, the split-application of K increased the nitrogen recovery efficiency in rice and wheat by 11.2\% and 10.8\%, respectively. Similarly, the phosphorus recovery efficiency was increased by 3.6\% and 7.4\% in rice and wheat, respectively. The split application of 60 kg K2O/ha also increased the K harvest index (\% of the total K absorbed is transferred to grain) by 0.7\% and 2.7\% in rice and wheat, respectively over applying entire K at basal. Similarly, the system productivity (11.26 t/ha) was increased by 8\% over applying entire K at basal. In the absence of top-dressing of K (30 kg/ha), two foliar-sprays of 2.5\% K provide equal benefits of top dressing. Application of 90 kg K2O/ha lowered the K negative balance (-99 kg/ha/year) considerably compared to two-split application of 60 kg K2O/ha (-152.5 kg/ha/year). Thus, optimization of K fertilization in RWCS will increase the system productivity, nutrient use efficiency, and sustainability.},

They incorporate such factors as rainfall, land surface temperature (LST), potential evapotranspiration (PET), soil moisture content (SM), and vegetation index to express the meteorological and agricultural aspects of drought. However, these five factors should be combined more comprehensively and reasonably to explain better the dryness/wetness of land surface and the association with crop yield. This study aims to develop the Integrated Crop Drought Index (ICDI) by combining the weather factors (rainfall and LST), hydrological factors (PET and SM), and a vegetation factor (enhanced vegetation index (EVI)) to better express the wet/dry state of land surface and healthy/unhealthy state of vegetation together. The study area was the State of Illinois, a key region of the U.S. Corn Belt, and the quantification and analysis of the droughts were conducted on a county scale for 2004-2019. The performance of the ICDI was evaluated through the comparisons with SDCI and VegDRI, which are the representative drought index in terms of the composite of the dryness and vegetation elements. The ICDI properly expressed both the dry and wet trend of the land surface and described the state of the agricultural drought accompanied by yield damage. The ICDI had higher positive correlations with the corn yields than SDCI and VegDRI during the crucial growth period from June to August for 2004-2019, which means that the ICDI could reflect the agricultural drought well in terms of the dryness/wetness of land surface and the association with crop yield. Future work should examine the other factors for ICDI, such as locality, crop type, and the anthropogenic impacts, on drought. It is expected that the ICDI can be a viable option for agricultural drought monitoring and yield management.},

In this study, the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) soil moisture product was applied to assess the dynamics of residual soil moisture in autumn (September to November) and its response to the long-term variability of rainfall in the Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB) of Ethiopia from 1992 to 2017. The basin was found to have autumn soil moisture (ASM) ranging from 0.09-0.38 m(3)/m(3), with an average of 0.26 m(3)/m(3). The ASM time series resulted in the coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 2.8\%-28\% and classified as low-to-medium variability. In general, the monotonic trend analysis for ASM revealed that the UBNB had experienced a wetting trend for the past 26 years (1992-2017) at a rate of 0.00024 m(3)/m(3)per year. A significant wetting trend ranging from 0.001 to 0.006 m(3)/m(3)per year for the autumn season was found. This trend was mainly showed across the northwest region of the basin and covers about 18\% of the total basin area. The spatial patterns and variability of rainfall and ASM were also found to be similar, which implies the strong relationship between rainfall and soil moisture in autumn. The spring and autumn season rainfall explained a considerable portion of ASM in the basin. The analyses also signified that the rainfall amount and distribution impacted by the topography and land cover classes of the basin showed a significant influence on the characteristics of the ASM. Further, the result verified that the behavior of ASM could be controlled by the loss of soil moisture through evapotranspiration and the gain from rainfall, although changes in rainfall were found to be the primary driver of ASM variability over the UBNB.},

	abstract = {We reconstructed soil moisture dynamics from sensor records, taught reconstructed dynamics to echo state neural networks (ESNN), and employed skillful ESNN architectures as digital twins to forecast real-world soil moisture levels out-of-sample. Recent proof-of-concept demonstrates that ESNN can learn complex nonlinear dynamics from clean data generated by closed `toy' models with known state-space dynamics. However, in modeling open real-world biophysical systems like the soil, we do not directly observe state space dynamics, and consequently must infer them from noisy data. We addressed these challenges by preprocessing data inputted into ESNN with methods from empirical nonlinear dynamics to filter noise, test for stationarity, and reconstruct state-space dynamics from denoised data. This promotes the dynamic efficiency of ESNN since it learns complex dynamics of stationary real-world dynamic systems from denoised data. We worked with two sensor records representing different irrigation practices collected in field trials in southern Florida. We reconstructed lowdimensional nonlinear-deterministic dynamics in both records providing empirical evidence that irregular sawtooth cycling due to complex wetting/drying events is not aberrational but intrinsic to the real-world soil moisture systems generating these records. We employed the UF-NVIDIA-GPU infrastructure to uniformly sample a large grid of ESNN hyper-parameters, and successfully screened for architectures skillfully reproducing state space dynamics reconstructed from sensor records. Skillful architectures served as digital twins to forecast soil moisture levels preserving lower- and higher frequency oscillations characterizing both sensor records, and to differentiate between recurring and sporadic extreme soil moisture events. This distinction fine-tunes irrigation planning by forecasting recurrent extreme events to the day. Operationalizing ESNN for real biophysical data has broader impacts in addressing pressing environmental challenges involving nonlinear biophysical processes and creating AI-based early-warning systems forecasting extreme environmental events (flooding, drought, landslides, fires).},

Spaceborne remote sensing is a keystone in monitoring at continental scale, as satellites can make observations of locations which are scarcely monitored by ground-based techniques. In recent years, several soil moisture products for continental scale monitoring became available from the main space agencies around the world. Making use of sensors aboard polar satellites sampling in the microwave spectrum, soil moisture can be measured and mapped globally every few days at a spatial resolution as fine as 25 km. However, complementarity of satellite observations is a crucial issue to improve the quality of the estimations provided. In this context, measurements within the visible and infrared from geostationary satellites provide information on the surface from a totally different perspective. In this study, we design a new retrieval algorithm for daily soil moisture monitoring based only on the land surface temperature observations derived from the METEOSAT second generation geostationary satellites. Soil moisture has been retrieved from the retrieval algorithm for an eight years period over Europe and Africa at the SEVIRI sensor spatial resolution (3 km at the sub-satellite point). The results, only available for clear sky and partly cloudy conditions, are for the first time extensively evaluated against in-situ observations provided by the International Soil Moisture Network and FLUXNET at sites across Europe and Africa. The soil moisture retrievals have approximately the same accuracy as the soil moisture products derived from microwave sensors, with the most accurate estimations for semi-arid regions of Europe and Africa, and a progressive degradation of the accuracy towards northern latitudes of Europe. Although some possible improvements can be expected by a better use of other products derived from SEVIRI, the new approach developped and assessed here is a valuable alternative to microwave sensors to monitor daily soil moisture at the resolution of few kilometers over entire continents and could reveal a good complementarity to an improved monitoring system, as the algorithm can produce surface soil moisture with less than 1 day delay over clear sky and non-steady cloudy conditions (over 10\% of the time).},

	abstract = {Ridge-furrow with full film mulching has been widely applied to increase crop yield and water productivity on the Loess Plateau, but it may stimulate carbon (C) mineralization. How to integrate other technological benefits based on this technology for long-term maintenance of high yield and soil fertility is a pressing issue. With the local farmers' practice (FP) as a control, three integrated soil-crop system management (ISSM) practices integrating fertilizer rates, fertilizer types and planting densities (ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and ISSM-MN) were established to improve maize yield and soil quality. Compared with the FP, the maize yield increased by 13.34\%, 21.83\% and 30.24\%, and the soil quality index (SQI) increased by 9.66\%, 14.91\% and 38.38\% for ISSM-N1, ISSM-N2 and ISSM-MN, respectively. However, ISSM-N1 did not significantly increase yield, and ISSM-N2 increased residual soil nitrate and decreased nitrogen (N) partial factor productivity significantly. Compared to the FP, ISSM practices increased soil organic carbon (SOC), labile organic C fractions (LOCFs) and potassium permanganate organic C fractions in the topsoil to varying degrees, but only ISSM-MN reached significant levels for most C fractions. The sensitivity index indicated very easily oxidizable C (24.6\%), easily oxidizable C (24.7\%), hot-water extractable C (30.8\%), labile organic C (24.7\%) and particulate organic C (57.3\%) were more sensitive than SOC (22.7\%). ISSM-MN sequestered significantly higher C than the other treatments. The results of the relative importance analysis and the structural equation model indicated that LOCFs were the direct contributors to yield, while recalcitrant C (CO) was the indirect contributor, revealing the underlying mechanism that CO decomposed to replenish LOCFs and the total N pool with the water soluble C pool as the transit station. Overall, ISSM-MN is the most promising strategy to improve crop yield and soil fertility in the long term on the Loess Plateau.},

	abstract = {The soil moisture in the surface layer (1 or 2 m) interacts with the atmosphere through evapotranspiration and influences land-atmosphere interactions, impacts rainfall-runoff processes, regulates net ecosystem exchange, and constrains food security. Thus, the accurate measurement with high depth resolution of surface soil moisture is of great significance to hydrology, meteorology, and agriculture. The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logging technology has the ability to study hydrogen-containing fluid dynamics in porous media and is expected to achieve in situ detection for soil moisture. In this paper, we propose a new design of a small diameter NMR logging probe based on compensating magnets, which increases the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and have high depth resolution (1 cm). The uniform design method is adopted to obtain the optimal compensation magnet parameters. Compared with the probe without compensation magnets, the SNR of the new probe can be increased by 5.2 times in theory. Then a soil moisture experiment of three group samples is conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new probe. The experiment results show that the new probe can obtain accurate results of soil moisture, and can also give the proportion of free water and bound water, which has been verified with the results of the Lab-NMR experiments. Finally, the factors that have an important influence on the measurement effect, such as the uniformity of the excitation magnetic field, the radial depth of investigation, and the echo time have been fully discussed.},

	abstract = {Cover crops (CC) increase soil fertility via recycling of nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and buildup of soil organic matter, whereby CC contributes to climate change mitigation. The carbon (C) input to soil occurs via the input of plant material (shoot and root) and via phyllo- and rhizodeposition. However, the quantity of phyllo- and rhizodeposition from CC is largely unexamined, although this component potentially has a large contribution to microbial stabilization of C. Isotopic labeling with C-13 to trace C flows and N-15 to determine N-2-fixation was conducted to test the short-term effect of the inclusion of winter vetch as a legume species to a CC mixture. The CC mixtures were established in a long-term experiment (1997-2019) with varying use of manure and CC cropping to test the effect of soil fertility on the behavior of the newly established CC mixtures. A significant reduction in the relative net phyllo- and rhizodeposition was observed with higher soil fertility. Interestingly, the quantity of net phyllo- and rhizodeposition was also reduced with higher soil fertility due to the lower relative phyllo- and rhizodeposition, despite a significantly higher CC biomass. Importantly, adjusting for unrecovered root fragments more than halved the calculated phyllo- and rhizodeposition, indicating that many published estimates are substantially overestimated. The use of CC during autumn provides an important window for C storage with both the input of plant biomass and belowground C investment being drivers of C storage.},

	abstract = {Double-cropping rice cultivation reduces soil fertility, and the extensive use of chemical fertilizers has harmful effects on both the environment and grain yield. The application of organic materials could be used as a practical strategy to maintain soil fertility and improve grain yield in a double-season rice cropping system. For this purpose, field experiments with six growing seasons over three years, from 2016 to 2018, were conducted to assess the effects of five organic materials (biochar, Chinese milk vetch, rice straw, rapeseed cake fertilizer, and manure) on the grain yield and soil fertility, aiming to save about 25\% of the chemical nitrogen (N) fertilizer required for all rice growing stages. The result showed that, compared with CK (the most common dose of fertilizer in this study region; 100\% chemical fertilizer without organic fertilizer), the grain yield and soil fertility of double-cropped rice were increased after applying organic fertilizers for three consecutive years. Specifically, the CRC treatment (Chinese milk vetch (10.77 t ha(-1) in fresh)/rice straw (26.51 t ha(-1) in fresh) + 75\% chemical fertilizer) showed significantly higher rates of effective panicles (4.65-10.92\%) and annual grain yield (8.00-8.82\%). The total N, total phosphorus (P), total potassium (K), alkaline N, and available P content in the CRC soil were significantly increased by 11.85\%, 12.22\%, 15.08\%, 23.32\%, and 41.04\%, respectively, relative to CK. The decomposition of the applied Chinese milk vetch and rice straw combined with 75\% chemical fertilizer resulted in more soil humus (9.50 g kg(-1)), humic acid (3.19 g kg(-1)), fulvic acid (3.26 g kg(-1)), and active organic carbon (5.78 g kg(-1)) and a significantly higher carbon pool management index (13.5\%), as well as significantly higher soil urease activity (18.10\%) and acid phosphatase activity (17.64\%). Therefore, in this study, Chinese milk vetch (10.77 t ha(-1) in fresh) in the early rice season/rice straw (26.51 t ha(-1) fresh) in the late rice season + 75\% chemical fertilizer treatment was the optimal dose for the double-season rice cropping system. It resulted in higher rice yields and has the potential to be used for more sustainable soil fertility.},

System innovations such as integrated soil fertility management (ISFM) and conservation agriculture have been proposed to tackle the complex challenges farmers face. In this study, we assess how different factors at the plot, farm and institutional level can influence the adoption of ISFM. We employed a stratified sampling approach to randomly select 285 and 300 farmers in Tamale, northern Ghana and Kakamega County, western Kenya, respectively. These two locations were selected to understand the underlying reasons for their divergent adoption levels. Ordinal regression models were used to identify determinants of adoption. In Tamale, adoption rates of ISFM are much lower than in Kakamega. Only 3\% of the farmers fully adopted the recommended practices compared with 36\% in Kakamega. The low availability of improved seeds is a major reason for the lower uptake of the complete ISFM paradigm in Tamale. The econometric analysis revealed that plot level variables such as soil carbon, soil texture, slope and plot area had a significant effect on the number of adopted ISFM components at both locations. Moreover, family labor availability is also an important factor. Other farm and household characteristics, such as off-farm occupation, livestock ownership, and membership in associations, matter for Kakamega only. Key policy recommendations include promotion of locally available organic resources and improved access to improved seeds in Tamale.},

Though the gravimetric method provides the most accurate soil moisture measurements, it cannot be extended to the regional-scale due to the large number of sampling requirements. An impedance probe is a suitable substitute for the time-intensive gravimetric method; however, it needs soil/field-specific calibrations for precise measurements. The present study aims to develop a generalized calibration of an impedance probe (i.e., ThetaProbe) for precise measurements of soil moisture at the regional-scale within the root-mean-square-error (RMSE) of 0.04 m(3) m(-3) to fulfil the accuracy requirement of current satellite missions. A few methods for calibrating impedance probe were investigated using 496 gravimetric samples and coincident impedance probe measurements collected over 83 locations through field campaigns in a paddy dominated tropical Indian watershed that covers an area of 500 km(2). The manufacturer generalized calibration was found to have high RMSE (0.0523 m(3) m(-3)) and considerable bias (0.0241 m(3) m(-3)) in soil moisture measurements. Developed generalized and soil-specific calibration based on a linear regression technique that resulted in RMSE values of 0.0468 and 0.0422 m(3) m(-3), respectively. Further, a Bayesian neural network (BNN) based method, a nonlinear technique, was used for developing a generalized calibration of the impedance probe. The results illustrated that BNN-based generalized calibration (RMSE {\textless} 0.04 m(3) m(-3)) performs better than the linear regression-based calibrations (RMSE {\textgreater} 0.04 m(3) m(-3)). Moreover, the performance of BNN-based generalized calibration was further improved by the inclusion of soil physical properties as input and yielded an RMSE value up to 0.0352 and 0.0366 m(3) m(-3) during training and cross-validation process, respectively.

We show that BCC-CSM2-MR is more skillful in reproducing the climate mean states and standard deviations of soil moisture, with pattern correlations increased and biases reduced significantly. BCC-CSM2-MR performs better in capturing the first two primary patterns of soil moisture anomalies, where the period of the corresponding time series is closer to that of reference data. Comparisons show that BCC-CSM2-MR performs at a high level among multiple models of CMIP6 in terms of centered pattern correlation and “amplitude of variation” (relative standard deviation). In general, the centered pattern correlation of BCC-CSM2-MR, ranging from 0.61 to 0.87, is higher than the multi-model mean of CMIP6, and the relative standard deviation is 0.75, which surmounts the overestimations in most of the CMIP6 models. Due to the vital role played by precipitation in land-atmosphere interaction, possible causes of the improvement of soil moisture simulation are further related to precipitation in BCC-CSM2-MR. The results indicate that a better description of the relationship between soil moisture and precipitation and a better reproduction of the climate mean precipitation by the model may result in the improved performance of soil moisture simulation.},

There is still a lack of information about the effect of these factors on the soil microbiological community. This study evaluated the effects of grazing, liming, and different P and K fertilization strategies on the soil microbial community and its relationship with soil chemical properties. For this purpose, a field experiment was established in 2017 on a subtropical Acrisol. Treatments consisted of two production systems: (i) integrated crop-livestock system (with winter sheep grazing) and (ii) specialized system (ungrazed), combined with two periods of P and K fertilization: (i) conventional fertilization (at soybean planting) and (ii) system fertilization (in the Italian ryegrass pasture). The effect of liming (with and without) was also evaluated. Eighteen months after lime application, the soil was sampled in the 0-5 and10-15 cm soil layers to evaluate soil chemical properties (pH, exchangeable Al, Ca, and Mg, available P and K, cation (Ca+Mg+K) saturation, and Al saturation) and soil microbial community composition. In the surface soil layer, a negative impact of lime application was observed for Gram+ bacteria (-29 \%) and actinomycetes (-21 \%), consequently decreasing the total bacterial community (-26 \%) and total microbial biomass (-27 \%). This negative impact of liming on Gram+ bacteria and actinomycetes was negatively related to the increase in soil pH, exchangeable Ca and Mg concentrations, and positively related to Al saturation and available K. The combination of an integrated system or system fertilization with lime increased arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi community 3.0-fold compared to a specialized system or conventional fertilization in the subsurface soil layer. In addition, sheep grazing increased saprophytic fungi biomass by 50 \% in the subsurface soil layer compared to the specialized system. These positive impacts on the soil fungal community were probably associated with increased plant residue input. Sheep grazing and the fertilization strategy did not affect soil chemical properties or the microbial community at the soil surface. Liming, system fertilization, and sheep grazing benefitted the soil fungal com-munity, thus improving soil health in highly weathered agricultural soils.},

Nutrient management by integrating organic manures and inorganic fertilizers may play a vital role in improving and sustaining crop productivity. A long-term field experiment (since 1984) comprising 11 treatments with different combinations of inorganic and organic fertilizers such as farm yard manure (FYM), wheat cut straw (WCS) and Dhaincha (Sesbania aculeata L.) as green manure (GM) was conducted to evaluate their effects on crop yield, nutrient accumulation and soil fertility status under a rice - wheat cropping system. The maximum grain yield of wheat was recorded in T-6, i.e. 50\% recommended dose of fertilizers (RDF) + 50\% nitrogen through FYM in rice and 100\% RDF in wheat (4291 kg ha(-1)) as compared to chemically fertilized plots T-5, i.e. 100\% RDF in both rice and wheat (3441 kg ha(-1)). The application of organic manures in combination with chemical fertilizers reduced soil pH and bulk density from 7.40 to 7.23 and 1.49 to 1.37 g cm(-3), respectively. Soil organic carbon (SOC), available soil nutrients and nutrient accumulation by crop were higher in integrated nutrient management-treated plots as compared to control. A positive and significant correlation was observed between SOC and available soil nitrogen (r = 0.987), phosphorus (r = 0.913) and potassium (r = 0.921).

Effects of rye termination at 7, 14, and 21 days after rolling were assessed as were the effects on soil water conservation, cotton population, and yield. Seven days after rolling, the 4-stage, 2-stage, and spiral rollers rolling 3 times generated 96, 92, and 81\% termination, respectively. Termination with the smooth roller with glyphosate was 94\% and the control (no rolling) was 37\%. At 14 days, termination among rollers was 91 to 98\% and at 21 days no differences were found among rollers (99-100\%). The 4-stage roller 3 times had the highest average soil volumetric water content (VWC) of 16.1\%, whereas the spiral roller 1 time had the lowest (13.6\%). Rolled rye had higher VWC content averaging 14.7\% (12-cm surface layer) compared to the control (12.7\%). Rolling treatments affected cotton emergence only in 2015; cotton population and yield were not affected. Seven days after rolling, the 4-stage and 2-stage roller/crimpers exceeded 90\% rye termination making earlier cotton planting possible if required by climatic conditions.},

This paper uses the proposed DCNN to predict soil moisture and plan irrigation for precision agriculture farmers to reduce water consumption used for cultivation and increase production yield by comparing water content during various stages of plant growth and integrating IoT applications into agriculture. It also optimizes the water level for future irrigation decisions to maintain crop growth and water stability.

It is well known that the surface soil moisture content (SMC) affects soil reflectance at all solar spectrum wavelengths. Therefore, future satellite missions, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission, will be essential for mapping and monitoring global soil moisture changes. Our study compares two widely used moisture retrieval models: the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance (MARMIT) and the soil water parametric (SWAP)-Hapke model. We evaluated the SMC retrieval accuracy of these models using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) hyperspectral imagery and goniometer hyperspectral data. Laboratory analysis employed hyperspectral goniometer data of sediment samples from four locations reflecting diverse environments, while field validation used hyperspectral UAS imaging and coordinated ground truth collected in 2018 and 2019 from a barrier island beach at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research site. The (SWAP)-Hapke model achieves comparable accuracy to MARMIT using laboratory hyperspectral data but is less accurate when applied to UAS hyperspectral imagery than the MARMIT model. We proposed a modified version of the (SWAP)-Hapke model, which achieves better results than MARMIT when applied to laboratory spectral measurements; however, MARMIT's performance is still more accurate when applied to UAS imagery. These results are likely due to differences in the models' descriptions of multiply-scattered light and MARMIT's more detailed description of air-water interactions.},

	abstract = {Today, the most popular approaches in agricultural forecasting leverage process-based crop models, crop monitoring data, and/or remote sensing imagery. Individually, each of these tools has its own unique advantages but is, nonetheless, limited in prediction accuracy, precision, or both. In this study we integrate in situ and remote sensing (RS) soil moisture observations with APSIM model through sequential data assimilation to evaluate the improvement in model predictions of downstream state variables across five experimental sites in the US Midwest. Four RS data products and in situ observations spanning 19 site years were used through two data assimilation approaches, namely ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) and generalized ensemble filter (GEF), to constrain model states at observed time steps and estimate joint background and observation error matrices. Then, the assimilation's impact on estimates of soil moisture, yield, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), tile drainage, and nitrate leaching was assessed across all site years. When assimilating in situ observations, the accuracy of soil moisture forecasts in the assimilation layers was improved by reducing RMSE by an average of 17 \% for 10 cm and similar to 28 \% for 20 cm depth soil layer across all site years. These changes also led to improved simulation of soil moisture in deeper soil layers by an average of 12 \%. Although crop yield was improved by an average of 23 \%, the greatest improvement in yield accuracy was demonstrated in site years with higher water stress, where assimilation served to increase available soil water for crop uptake. Alternatively, estimates of annual tile drainage and nitrate leaching were not well constrained across the study sites. Trends in drainage constraint suggest the importance of including additional data constraint such as evapotranspiration. The assimilation of RS soil moisture showed a weaker constraint of downstream model state variables when compared to the assimilation of in situ soil moisture. The median reduction in soil moisture RMSE for observed soil layers was lower, on average, by a factor of 5. However, crop yield estimates were still improved overall with a median RMSE reduction of 17.2 \%. Crop yield prediction was improved when assimilating both in situ and remote sensing soil moisture observations, and there is strong evidence that yield improvement was higher when under water-stressed conditions. Comparisons of system performance across different combinations of remote sensing data products indicated the importance of high temporal resolution and accurate observation uncertainty estimates when assimilating surface soil moisture observations.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) is a fundamental environmental variable for characterizing climate, land surface and atmosphere. In recent years, several SM products have been developed based on remote sensing (RS), land surface model (LSM) or land data assimilation system (LDAS). However, little knowledge is available in understanding spatial patterns of the uncertainty of different SM products and potential regional drivers over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), a complex environment for accurate SM estimation. This paper investigates the sensitivity of the SM uncertainties based on the three-cornered hat (TCH) method and a generalized additive model (GAM) in terms of underlying surface characteristics (sand fraction, soil organic matter, vegetation, land surface temperature, and topography) and near-ground meteorology (precipitation and air temperature) in the third pole environment over the 2015-2018 period. Eleven SM products are involved in this work, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity INRA-CESBIO (SMOS-IC), Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), Land Surface Parameter Model (LPRM), Climate Change Initiative - Active/Combined (CCI\_A/CCI\_C), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Interim reanalysis (ERA-Interim), Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model product a/b (GLEAM\_a/GLEAM\_b), and Random Forest Soil Moisture (RFSM). Results show that most of the SM products perform well across QTP, while SMOS-IC is strongly affected by radio-frequency interference in this region, JAXA has a relatively higher noise level over QTP, and LPRM has larger relative uncertainties (RUs) in the southeast of QTP. Nonlinear regression analysis demonstrates that variations of RUs in SMOS-IC and JAXA are driven by topography, while LPRM's are mainly controlled by vegetation. In addition, two groups of opposite (positive/negative) effects from topography and vegetation, topography and precipitation, and precipitation and land surface temperature affect the spatial variations of RUs in CCI\_A, RFSM, and ERA-Interim, respectively. Meanwhile, more complex relationships are found between multiple surface factors and RUs of different products. In general, the underlying surface factors explain on average 39.41\% and 28.34\% of the variations in RS and LSM/LDAS SM RUs, respectively. Comparatively, the near-ground meteorology factors have a slightly larger effect on LSM/LDAS products than that on RS products.},

	abstract = {Long-term excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer induces secondary salinization of soil, which results in inhibiting plant growth. In addition, soil moisture deficiency also affects plant growth. To investigate the effects of excessive nitrogen fertilizer and soil moisture deficiency on the antioxidant enzyme system, plant water relations analyzed through pressure-volume (P-V) curve, and photosynthetic light response parameters in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L. Myoko) seedlings, an indoor experiment of about 50 d was conducted using two irrigation water amounts based on field capacity (soil moisture deficiency: 50\%-80\%; adequate water: 70\%-80\%), two nitrogen fertilizer rates (moderate nitrogen; excessive nitrogen fertilizer: 0.585 g/pot) and two types of irrigation water (tap water and microbial diluent). The results showed that excessive nitrogen fertilizer (N) and soil moisture deficiency (W) reduced the biomass of tomato seedlings. In comparison to CK (combination of adequate water and tap water quality), microbial dilution (EM) increased plant biomass by 5.2\%. Also, the nitrogen application increased chlorophyll relative contents (SPAD). The maximum net photosynthetic rate (Pc) decreased with nitrogen application and increased with EM application and irrigation amount. Excessive nitrogen application increased the plant nitrate reductase activity (NR). The plant NR in the N treatment showed a 13.0\% increase compared to CK, and the plant NR in the treatment of nitrogen application with water deficiency (WN) increased 34.0\% compared to water deficiency (W). After applying excessive nitrogen, N, EM-N, WN, EM-WN respectively increased the plant nitrate reductase activity by 13.0\%, 22.9\%, 34.0\%, and 28.6\%, compared with the corresponding treatment with moderate nitrogen (i.e., CK, EM, W and EM-W). In addition, the activities of antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT)] in four treatments of nitrogen application (N, EM-N, WN, EM-WN) also increased significantly. Both soil moisture and nitrogen fertilizer significantly affect the parameters of osmotic adjustment, which is manifested in the reduction of osmotic potential (pi FT), and the increase in the osmotic concentration (Cosm) and concentration difference (Delta Cosm). But the decrease in the relative water content of apoplast (zeta ap) indicated that water deficiency and excessive nitrogen reduced the water absorption and water retention capacity of tomatoes to a certain extent. In conclusion, excessive nitrogen application and soil moisture deficiency inhibit plant growth significantly in this experiment. Meanwhile, microbial dilution can alleviate excessive nitrogen fertilizer and water stress to some extent, but the effect was not significant.},

In this study, a methodology of using the first brightness Stokes parameter (i.e., the sum of vertical and horizontal polarization brightness temperature) observed by the soil moisture and ocean salinity (SMOS) was proposed to improve the soil moisture retrieval under complex topographic conditions. The applicability of the proposed method is validated using in-situ soil moisture measurements collected at four networks (Pali, Naqu, Maqu, and Wudaoliang) on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The results over Pali, which is a typical mountainous area, showed that soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes parameter are in better agreement with the in-situ measurements (the correlation coefficient R {\textgreater} 0.75 and unbiased root mean square error {\textless}0.04 m(3)/m(3)) compared with that using the single-polarization brightness temperature. At the other three networks with relatively flatter terrains, soil moisture retrievals using the first brightness Stokes parameter are found to be comparable to the single-polarization retrievals. On the contrary, the maximum bias of the retrieved soil moisture caused by topographic effects exceeds 0.1 m(3)/m(3) when using vertical or horizontal polarization alone, which is far beyond the expected accuracy (0.04 m(3)/m(3)) of SMOS satellite. In the regions on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau where the vegetation effect can be ignored, soil moisture retrieved using horizontal polarization brightness temperature is generally underestimated, overestimated when using vertical polarization brightness temperature. It is reasonable due to the polarization rotation effect (depolarization) caused by the topographic effects. It is concluded that the proposed method for soil moisture retrieval using the first brightness Stokes parameter has a great potential in reducing the influence of topographic effects.},

Today, most remotely sensed soil moisture products have difficulties in resolving irrigation signals at the plot scale. This study aims to use Sentinel-1 radar backscatter and Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery to estimate SSM at high spatial (10 m) and temporal resolution (at least 5 days) over an agricultural domain. Three supervised machine learning algorithms, multilayer perceptron (MLP), a convolutional neural network (CNN), and linear regression models, were trained to estimate changes in SSM based on the variation in surface reflectance and backscatter over five different crops. Results showed that CNN is the best algorithm as it understands spatial relations and better represents two-dimensional images. Estimated values for SSM were in agreement with in-situ measurements regardless of the crop type, with RMSE=0.0292 (cm3/cm3) and R2=0.92 for the Sentinel-2 derived SSM and RMSE=0.0317 (cm3/cm3) and R2=0.84 for the Sentinel-1 soil moisture data. Moreover, a time series of estimated SSM based on Sentinel-1 (SSM-S1), Sentinel-2 (SSM-S2), and SSM derived from SMAP-Sentinel1 was compared. The developed SSM data showed a significantly higher mean SSM state over irrigated agriculture relative to the rainfed cropland area during the irrigation season. The multiple comparisons (fisher LSD) were tested and found that these two groups are different (pvalue=0.035 in 95\% confidence interval). Therefore, by employing the maximum likelihood classification on the SSM data, we managed to map the irrigated agriculture. The overall accuracy of this unsupervised classification is 77\%, with a kappa coefficient of 65\%.},

Irrigation performance test was designed to investigate water application rate and distribution uniformities. The overall water application uniformity coefficients (Cu), determined through Christiansen (Cud) and Heerman (CuH) methods, were determined at 81.29\% and 80.64\%, respectively. However, the overall water distribution uniformity (Du) was determined at 70\%. A considerable variability in the distribution uniformity of irrigation water was observed across the experimental field (a Du value of 67\% over the medium spans compared to a Du value of 88\% over the inner spans). Results of this study showed a linear correlation between the irrigation water distribution uniformity and the soil N (R-2=0.88). On the other hand, the vegetation cover distribution, indicated by the Cumulative Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (CNDVI), was not found to be much responsive to the irrigation distribution uniformity (R-2=0.11). A time series of successive NDVI maps extracted throughout the potato crop growth stages showed a consistent trend in the distribution of NDVI across the field, with R 2 values that ranged between 0.25-0.73.},

	abstract = {Recently, recurrent deep networks have shown promise to harness newly available satellite-sensed data for long-term soil moisture projections. However, to be useful in forecasting, deep networks must also provide uncertainty estimates. Here we evaluated Monte Carlo dropout with an input-dependent data noise term (MCD+N), an efficient uncertainty estimation framework originally developed in computer vision, for hydrologic time series predictions. MCD+N simultaneously estimates a heteroscedastic input-dependent data noise term (a trained error model attributable to observational noise) and a network weight uncertainty term (attributable to insufficiently constrained model parameters). Although MCD+N has appealing features, many heuristic approximations were employed during its derivation, and rigorous evaluations and evidence of its asserted capability to detect dissimilarity were lacking. To address this, we provided an in-depth evaluation of the scheme's potential and limitations. We showed that for reproducing soil moisture dynamics recorded by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, MCD+N indeed gave a good estimate of predictive error, provided that we tuned a hyperparameter and used a representative training data set. The input-dependent term responded strongly to observational noise, while the model term clearly acted as a detector for physiographic dissimilarity from the training data, behaving as intended. However, when the training and test data were characteristically different, the input-dependent term could be misled, undermining its reliability. Additionally, due to the data-driven nature of the model, data noise also influences network weight uncertainty, and therefore the two uncertainty terms are correlated. Overall, this approach has promise, but care is needed to interpret the results.},

Along with soil moisture measured with a probe on the ground, a study of correlation with satellite imagery was conducted using a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model. Furthermore, the Dubois model was used to predict soil moisture. Results have shown that NBMI on a logarithmic scale provides a good representation of soil moisture change with R-2 similar to 86\%. The MLR model showed a positive correlation of soil moisture with the co-polarized backscatter coefficient, but an opposite correlation with the surface roughness and angle of incidence. The results of the Dubois model showed poor correlation of 44.37\% and higher RMSE error of 17.1, demonstrating the need for detailed and accurate measurement of surface roughness as a prerequisite for simulating the model. Of the three approaches, index-based measurement has been shown to be the most rapid for understanding soil moisture change and has the potential to be used for understanding some mechanisms of natural disasters under similar soil conditions.},

However, the effects of AWD on organic nitrogen (ON) partitioning in rice-microbe ecosystems and soil microbial communities are poorly understood. A root-box microcosm experiment with two rice varieties (Nipponbare, Nip; Yangdao 6, YD6), two irrigation regimes (conventional flood irrigation (CF); AWD) and three N application levels (zero N, N0; medium N, N1; high N, N2) was performed based on the 13C,15N-labelled glycine and 13C-phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) techniques. Compared to CF, AWD increased soil dissolved oxygen, microbial growth and the enzymes related to N transformation, thus enhancing rice growth and the N utilization index (NUI). Approximately 4.9-10.3\% and 7.7-13.6\% of the exogenous glycine was directly utilized by Nip and YD6 seedlings, respectively, and its ratio increased with increasing N levels, whereas 4.4-11.2\% and 4.6-10.3\% were incorporated into soil microbes. It seems that rice has an appreciable capacity to utilize organic N despite fierce competition with soil microbes. The 13C:15N ratio showed that 12.5-37.5\% and 11.0-41.0\% of the added glycine was taken up intact by soil microorganisms in the rhizospheres of Nip and YD6. At the N1 and N2 levels, AWD increased rice 15N-glycine uptake but decreased microbial 15N-glycine uptake. Rice intact glycine uptake and soil inorganic N contents were positively correlated with rice biomass and NUI, indicating that the enhanced inorganic N under AWD is beneficial for soil ON availability and rice growth. Gram-negative and general bacteria were the dominant competitors with rice for soil ON. AWD increased the contents of gram-negative bacteria and fungi and the ratio of fungi:bacteria in rhizosphere soils. Collectively, AWD creates a good rhizosphere oxygen environment for rice and microbial growth. ON partitioning in the rice-microbe system and the adaptive adjustment of the microbial community play important roles in modulating soil nutrients for optimal rice growth.},

We examined the effects of compost tea on soil and plant chemistry and microbial community enzyme activity on an organic blueberry farm in Minnesota, USA. We randomly assigned plants to one of three compost tea treatments: aerated compost tea under ambient temperature, heated and aerated compost tea, and a control treatment. Heated and aerated compost tea increased soil percent nitrogen compared to the other treatments, and decreased activity of beta-1,4-N-acetylglucosaminidase, an enzyme involved in chitin degradation, compared to the aerated-only treatment. We propose that the production method of compost tea has a significant effect on its efficacy as an organic soil amendment.},

	abstract = {Land Surface Temperature (LST) against Vegetation Index (VI) scatterplot is a base concept of Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) which is a widely used drought index taking into account evaporation over heterogenic area. The main advantage of using TVDI is that it reflects rather a soil moisture conditions than volumetric soil moisture itself. This is particularly useful when the aim of conducting research is to assess water availability for plants rather than volumetric soil moisture at some depth. Results that have been obtained so far using indices based on LST-VI scatterplot proved their effectiveness in meadows, pastures or crops but were not satisfactory enough over forest areas. An important limitation of using TVDI is a need to collect LST and VI data from heterogenic areas, to provide different soil moisture conditions which is often difficult to ensure.In this paper, we proposed a new approach to the TVDI calculation method in which we use temporal vari-ability of soil moisture conditions (shown in different satellite images of the same area) instead of their spatial heterogeneity.Calculations were conducted over the forest area in Tuczno Poland. To calculate the temporal TVDI model 4 Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS scenes were used, and calculation was performed in Python 3 using open-source packages. The average moisture conditions of each chosen scene were validated using field data, namely evapotranspira-tion determined from an eddy covariance.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is among the most essential variables in hydrology and earth science. Many satellite missions, such as AMSR-E/2, have been launched to observe it in broader spatial coverage to overcome the shortage of in situ observations. However, the satellite soil moisture products have been reported to comprise errors caused by the so-called “temperature effects” widely observed in dielectrically measured in situ volumetric soil water content (SWC). In this work, we confirmed the existence of these errors in AMSR2 soil moisture products. A new algorithm was developed to remove these errors using satellite data at ascending and descending overpasses. The application of this algorithm to both satellite and in situ data of SWC and soil temperature at the Mongolia site shows that the difference between SWC values at ascending and descending overpasses caused by temperature effects is effectively removed. We assess the impact of this removal method on satellite data by comparing it with in situ data, utilizing metrics such as the correlation coefficient and other widely adopted evaluation methods. It is shown that the difference between the original and corrected in situ SWC is much smaller than that between AMSR2 and in situ SWC, either corrected or not. The results indicate that the metric values between the corrected AMSR2 and in situ SWC, after removing apparent differences caused by temperature effects, slightly improved compared to those between the original AMSR2 and in situ SWC. Though these findings imply that the removed errors may not be the most dominant, considering the current significant difference between AMSR2 and in situ SWC, the removal makes the ascending and descending data have close characteristics. It may allow using data at both ascending and descending overpasses and double the temporal resolution of AMSR2 SWC data.},

This study evaluates the local and nonlocal feedbacks of soil moisture on summer (June-September) precipitation in the NAM region using observational data. We applied a multivariate statistical method known as the Stepwise Generalized Equilibrium Feedback Assessment (SGEFA) to control for internal atmospheric variability and sea surface temperature (SST) forcings so that we could isolate the impact of soil moisture feedbacks on NAM precipitation. Our results identify feedback pathways between soil moisture and precipitation in the NAM region and in the southern Rocky Mountains (SRM) region. Wet soils in the SRM result in lower-than-normal local surface temperature, weaker water vapor transport from the eastern Pacific and the Gulf of California (GOC), and less monsoon precipitation. Precipitation over the U.S. Great Plains also significantly increases when there are wet soils in the SRM. This occurs due to an enhanced water vapor influx into this region. On the other hand, anomalously wet soils in the NAM region increase NAM precipitation by enhancing local moist static energy and increasing the strength of the monsoonal circulation. Our observational results using SGEFA agree well with previous numerical modeling studies. This study highlights the critical role of land-atmosphere interactions for understanding NAM variability.},

The objective of this study was to evaluate different K forms and their balance for 17 years with ICLS. ICLS experimental area used no-till practices with different grazing intensities of cattle in winter pasture (black oat + annual ryegrass) and soybean production in the summer season. The experiment started in May 2001 at a location with a Rhodic Hapludox (Oxisol). The treatments consisted of varied grazing intensities: intensive grazing (IG) at 10 cm of pasture height, moderate grazing (MG) at 20 cm of pasture height, and a no grazing (NG) treatment. The experimental design was a randomized block design with three replicates. Soil samples were collected in 2001, 2007, 2012 and 2017 in 0-5, 5-10, 10-15 and 15-20 cm of soil layers. Desorption of K was measured using the Mehlich-1 method and the results were fitted to first-order kinetic equations to obtain readily and potentially available K content. Total K was determined by X-ray fluorescence, and the unavailable K by the difference between the total K and potentially available K. Long-term no-till ICLS resulted in an increase in more readily available K forms in the soil surface. The increase was especially prominent in the no-grazing treatment due to the greater amount of K left in the plant residues. Regardless of grazing intensity, soybean cultivation was the controlling component of the soil nutrient budget, representing 98.6 \% of the total amount of K exported. Animal outputs represent only 1.4 \% of total K exported and are therefore the recycling component of the system. Although meat production in ICLS represents only a very small fraction of the amount of K exported from the system, K tends to become less available in the grazed treatments in the long-term.},

The present study develops an image processing method using band 3 (Green), band 4(Red), band 5 (NIR), band 6 (SWIR 1), and band 10 (TIR) of Landsat 8 and band 2 (Green), band 3 (Red), band 4 (NIR), band 5 (SWIR) and band 6 (TIR) of Landsat 7 data for determining the different spectral indices. The relationship between Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) are based on experimental parameterization for soil moisture index. Both LST and NDVI are considered indispensable data to obtain SMI calculation. The statistical analysis of NDVI and LST was exposed in the standardized regression coefficient. The study found a weak negative correlation between NDVI and LST in both 2001 (R-2 = 0.37) and 2021 (R-2 = 0.16). As the LST increases, the vegetative cover reduces due to the record of high temperatures in the study area. The SMI result for 2021 shows that the majority of the study area experienced extreme anomalies when compared to the 2001 result. Second, a significant negative correlation existed between SMI and LST (R-2 = 0.664 in 2001 and R-2 = 1 in 2021), which indicates that the surface soil moisture reduces with LST. The normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) value ranges from - 0.71 to 0.75 in 2001 and - 0.33 to 0.40 in 2021. In 2001 and 2021, the normalized difference water index (NDWI) ranges from - 0.47 to 0.64 and - 0.531 to 0.154, respectively. Therefore, the current study gives a clear understanding of considerable variations in soil moisture and vegetation water content in the Palakkad District during the study period.},

However, current studies cannot precisely capture subtle nutrient variations between soil layers and their complex relationships with root growth. They also struggle to assess the impact of different fertilizer application depths on sunflower root development and distribution as well as their response to the spatial and temporal distribution of nutrients.Methods The Agricultural Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) model was employed to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of nitrogen distribution in the soil at three controlled-release fertilizer (CRF) placement depths: 5, 15, and 25 cm. This study investigated the characteristics of the root system regarding nitrogen absorption and utilization and analyzed their correlation with sunflower yield formation. Furthermore, this study introduced the modified Jaccard index (considering the compatibility between soil nitrate and root length density) to analyze soil-root interactions, providing a deeper insight into how changes in CRF placement depth affect crop growth and nitrogen uptake efficiency.Results The results indicated that a fertilization depth of 15 cm improved the modified Jaccard index by 6.60\% and 7.34\% compared to 5 cm and 25 cm depths, respectively, maximizing sunflower yield (an increase of 9.44\%) and nitrogen absorption rate (an increase of 5.40\%). This depth promoted a greater Root Length Density (RLD), with an increases of 11.95\% and 16.42\% compared those at 5 cm and 25 cm, respectively, enhancing deeper root growth and improving nitrogen uptake. In contrast, shallow fertilization led to higher nitrate concentrations in the topsoil, whereas deeper fertilization increased the nitrate concentrations in the deeper soil layers.Discussion These results provide valuable insights for precision agriculture and sustainable soil management, highlighting the importance of optimizing root nitrogen absorption through tailored fertilization strategies to enhance crop production efficiency and minimize environmental impact.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key land surface parameter that reflects conditions of drought in agricultural areas, such that variations in soil moisture significantly impact agricultural production. At a large spatial scale, soil moisture can be indicated using the temperature vegetation drought index (TVDI), which is based on soil moisture monitoring. Such metrics allow us to know whether or not the soil in a region is experiencing drought. The TVDI can be estimated by using either the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) or the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) combined with land surface temperature (LST) data. Our objectives were to study the applicability of the NDVI-based TVDI (TVDINDVI) and EVI-based TVDI (TVDIEVI) in the monitoring of soil moisture at a large time-space scale. The TVDI(NDVI)and TVDI(EVI)were calculated by constructing a feature space based on the NDVI (or EVI) and LST to obtain the corresponding dry/wet-edge equation. By establishing a correlation relationship between the TVDIs and soil moisture at soil depths of 0-10, 0-40, 0-100, and 0-200 cm, the applicability of the TVDI(EVI)and TVDI(NDVI)was investigated for seven different climatic regions in mainland China. The relationships between soil moisture at the 0-10-cm depth and the NDVI (or EVI) in cold and warm seasons were obtained. Linear functions of soil moisture and the TVDINDVI(TVDIEVI) were constructed. From the results, both the TVDI(NDVI)and TVDI(EVI)were more suitable for monitoring soil moisture at the 0-10-cm depth than at the other depths. The regions that had the best correlations between soil moisture and the TVDINDVI(TVDIEVI) were in northwestern China during the cold season and southeastern China during the warm season (from April to September), meaning that the TVDI was more applicable in these region/season combinations. The TVDI(NDVI)showed better performance in reflecting soil moisture conditions than the TVDIEVI, especially in the warm season. The applicability of the TVDI(EVI)for soil moisture at the 0-10-cm depth was better than that of the TVDI(NDVI)in northwestern China. However, in the other regions, the TVDI(NDVI)performed better. The performance of TVDINDVI(TVDIEVI) was better than TVDIEVI(TVDINDVI) under different circumstances, which was related to the goodness of fit for wet/dry-edge equations, natural variability of NDVI/EVI/LST, depths, changes in seasons (vegetation cover), and regions. This research compared the applications of the TVDI in China comprehensively.},

	abstract = {As climate change continues, forests are increasingly suffering from drought stress, which is leading to widespread forest dieback, but also to increased mortality of individual trees. In this regard, the impact of small-scale differences in water availability on individual trees has not yet been sufficiently studied to determine possible responses of different tree species to future droughts. Since conventional soil moisture monitoring and sampling methods only consider single points or small volumes, Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT) is becoming increasingly important to cover a larger survey area and to detect small-scale heterogeneities with regard to soil properties and soil moisture. The current study describes the application of a combined two- and three-dimensional geoelectrical monitoring approach with daily measurements over two years (May 2021 - April 2023) in a forest ecosystem in Lower Franconia (northwestern Bavaria, Germany), which is strongly affected by climate change. Soil water content, soil matric potential, throughfall, and stem flow are also measured at the forest site as well as precipitation at an adjacent forest clearing. The seasonally (long-term) and precipitation-driven (short-term) temporal change of soil resistivity is correlated strongly with the measured soil water content and matric potential. The applied 3D-ERT approach also allowed a first three-dimensional monitoring of the subsurface below a European beech located in the middle of the measuring grid with a daily resolution. The corresponding results also provide first indications that besides soil moisture changes also chemical processes in the subsurface may influence temporal resistivity changes in the soil of forest sites. The results of this study show that daily 3D-ERT is very suitable for investigating small-scale as well as shortand long-term variations in soil moisture, which is becoming increasingly important for understanding the causal relationships considering tree mortality and the subsurface.},

In this study, we examined the effect of weed barrier cloth (WBC) ground cover compared to two living mulches, perennial peanut (PPC) and a crimson clover rotation (CCR), on plant performance, soil microbiome, and nitrogen (N) cycling during the establishment phase of tea grown in central Florida. Three years after installation, plants under WBC had significantly higher yields than those with the living mulches. The effect of groundcover on soil microbiome was evaluated via qPCR gene count estimation of N-cycling associated genes, as well as dilution plating to establish count and diversity of culturable soil fungi, bacteria and N fixing bacteria. Soil under PPC had higher concentrations of genes associated with N cycling and P solubilization and higher plate counts of culturable microbes, including N fixing bacteria, compared to soil under WBC. Of the two living mulches, PPC soil had significantly higher counts of ammonia oxidizing genes and cultured fungi and bacteria than CCR soil. The impacts of ground cover on N cycling were further examined through an in vitro soil incubation study and an in situ field study of fertilizer-amended and unamended soil under PPC and WBC. In the in vitro study, after 7 days of incubation, 47.3 \% of the supplied N was mineralized in PPC soil compared to 20.2 \% in WBC soil. Throughout the 28-day incubation, the PPC treatment showed higher levels of nitrate than WBC. In the in situ microplot column field study, no significant differences were found in the overall amount of N mineralized, but differences in the timing of mineralization were observed: the highest nitrate concentration occurred at day 14 under PPC and day 28 under WBC. During the establishment period of tea, use of WBC may benefit plant growth; however, it may also result in changes in nutrient cycling microbial populations that alter the N mineralization rate of applied fertilizers compared to living mulch cover crops. Results of our study established foundational data on N mineralization from organic fertilizers in field grown tea. The rates of N mineralization from organic N fertilizer and soil microbial diversity under WBC and a legume cover crop estimated in this study will be of value for establishing sustainable tea production systems.},

Enhanced non-enzymatic antioxidant parameters (ABTS, DPPH, Fe-ion reducing power and Fe-ion chelation) was found in microbe inoculated rice reflecting high free radical scavenging activity in polyphenolics-rich leaf extracts. Increased enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxidase (PO), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and catalase (CAT) showed improved ROS scavenging in rice plants having co-inoculation. Over-expression of PAL, cCuZn-SOD and CAT genes in microbial inoculated rice plants was recorded. The study concludes that plant stage-wise concomitant fortification by microbial inoculants could play multi-pronged manifestations at physiological, biochemical and molecular level in rice to positively influence growth, development and defense attributes in plants.},

	abstract = {Crop residue incorporation is an effective agricultural management to enhance soil organic carbon and nitrogen (N) sequestration, which inevitably affects the crop N uptake, and consequently the allocation of N in the soil-plant system. However, to what extent the crop residue type and soil fertility moderate the contribution and recovery of maize (Zea mays. L) residue-derived N (residue-N) in the soil-plant system is poorly understood. Therefore, a 2-year in situ experiment was conducted on an Alfisol with high fertility (HF) and low fertility (LF), along with the application of 15 N-labeled maize root or straw (both stem and leaf) residues. The results showed that the HF treatment had a smaller proportion of residue-N in total N uptake compared with the LF treatment (on average of 2.0\% vs. 3.6\%), but with a larger recovery rate (on average of 23.5\% vs. 12.8\%). The application of straw residues increased the proportion of residue-N in plant total N compared with that from the application of root residues in the HF treatment. The percentage of residue-N in total soil N (TSN) and the residue-N recovery in the LF soil were 60.7-108.5\% and 9.6-25.8\% higher than those in the HF soil, respectively. The proportion of root-derived N (root-N) in TSN was significantly higher than that of straw-derived N (straw-N) in the LF soil. In addition, total residue-N recovery rates were similar among all residue-amended treatments. The results indicated that the soil with high fertility could increase residue-N utilization by plant, especially the straw-N, while the soil with low fertility favored the accumulation of the residue-N in soil, especially the root-N, and its low fertility was more likely to be improved. Overall, soil fertility and residue type could significantly affect the allocation of maize residue-N in the soil-plant system.},

	abstract = {The rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis)-cassava (Manihot esculenta) intercropping system is one of the most popular intercropping patterns for small-holder rubber planters. However, this practice is not recommended in some rubber-producing countries, since it is believed that the rubber tree and cassava share some identical pathogens and that the intercropping system will deplete soil fertility. The effects of cassava allelochemicals on rubber tree pathogens have never been reported. Using controlled plate tests, pot tests, and field experiments, this study aimed to assess the possible adverse effects that cassavas may impart to rubber plantations. The results showed: (1) although the leaf extract, decomposed leaf extract and root exudates of cassava inhibited or had no effect on the mycelial growth of the rubber tree pathogenCorynespora cassiicola,10 mg mL(-1)and 100 mg mL(-1)cassava leaf water extracts and testing concentrations of cassava root extraction significantly promoted the mycelial growth of the rubber tree pathogenRigidoporus lignosus, which increased the risk of rubber tree white root disease; (2) the overall soil fertility was increased significantly in the rubber tree-cassava intercropping system. However, the soil phosphorus content was reduced significantly in the field experiment; (3) the average girth of rubber trees was significantly reduced, and the girth uniformity was decreased in the intercropping system. Based on the experiment results, we suggested that an optimised fertiliser recommendation, particularly on the phosphorus amount, should be developed and implemented for the rubber tree-cassava intercropping system. In addition, since the intercropping of cassava will increase the risk ofR. lignosus-induced rubber tree white root disease, which is very hard to prevent and eradicate once rubber trees are infected, the intercropping of cassava in rubber plantation rows should not be recommended in theR. lignosusprevailing areas.},

While such systems may have a positive effect on soil fertility, the respective roles of the trees and the herbaceous vegetation in shaping this effect remain unclear. We investigated the effect of the distance from herbaceous strips with or without walnut trees on soil fertility and earthworm communities in a 20 year old Mediterranean plot intercropped with tomatoes. Methods We determined the effects of i) the presence of trees, ii) the distance from the herbaceous strip (0 m, 1 m and 2.5 m) and iii) the distance from the tree on microbial biomass and respiration, earthworm density and soil C, N and P contents in the 0-25 cm layer at three sampling seasons. Results Herbaceous strips presented a higher microbial biomass C related to soil organic carbon, a lower microbial metabolic quotient, and a higher density of earthworms than the crop alley regardless of tree presence. Soil organic carbon content increased in the presence of trees. Available P and microbial biomass increased at 1 m from the tree in the HS. Earthworm density and microbial biomass were higher at 1 m than at 2.5 m from the HS. Conclusions Herbaceous strips were an effective shelter for earthworms and fostered a high and efficient microbial biomass throughout the year, with or without trees, probably due to diversified vegetation and no soil disturbance. The mechanisms by which these changes could impact the crop alley remain to be studied.},

Based on the development of the coupled system of National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)-Global Forecast System (GFS) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-Land Information System (LIS) in this paper, we designed an experiment to demonstrate the impacts of assimilating the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) SM data products on the weather forecasts of GFS. With respect to the surface air temperature analysis product of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-Climate Prediction Center (CPC) and CPC's morphing method-based precipitation data, improvement from the ASCAT SM assimilation for probabilities of high quality forecasts can reach up to 1.7\% for GFS precipitation, 3.1\% for 2-meter minimum temperature, and 3.1\% for 2-meter diurnal temperature range predictions, respectively.

The experiment was laid out in factorial randomized block design with three factors (tillage, seed priming and nutrient management) and control as independent treatment for general comparison of results. The findings showed that chemical and microbial properties of soil were enhanced under zero tillage+ mulch as compared to other tillage practices. However, crop productivity was higher in conventional tillage+ mulch (70.28 q/ha (maize), 35.27 q/ha (wheat)).

	abstract = {Overuse of nitrogen (N) fertilizer has led to low N use efficiency (NUE) and high N loss in single rice cropping systems in southeast China. Application of controlled-release urea (CRU) is considered as an effective N fertilizer practice for improving crop yields and NUE. Here, field experiments were conducted during 2015-2017 to assess the effects of two CRUs (resin-coated urea (RCU) and polyurethane-coated urea (PCU)) on rice yields, NUE and soil fertility at two sites (Lincheng town (LC) and Xintang town (XT)). Four treatments were established at each site: (1) control with no N application (CK), (2) split application of conventional urea (U, 270kgN ha(-1)), (3) single basal application of RCU (RCU, 216kgN ha(-1)), and (4) single basal application of PCU (PCU, 216kgN ha(-1)). The N application rate in the CRU treatment compared to the U treatment was reduced by 20\%. However, the results showed that, compared to split application of urea, single basal application of CRU led to similar rice grain yields and aboveground biomass at both sites. No significant difference in the N uptake by rice plant was observed between the U and CRU treatments at either site. There were no significant differences in the N apparent recovery efficiency (NARE) among the U, RCU and PCU treatments, with the exception of that in XT in 2015. Compared to application of U, application of CRU increased the N agronomic efficiency (NAE) and N partial factor productivity (NPFP) by 17.4-52.6\% and 23.4-29.8\% at the LC site, and 15.0-84.1\% and 23.2-33.4\% at the XT site, respectively, during 2015-2017. Yield component analysis revealed that greater rice grain yield in response to N fertilizer was attributed mainly to the number of panicles per m(2), which increased in the fertilized treatments compared to the CK treatment. The application of CRU did not affect the soil fertility after rice harvest in 2016. Overall, these results suggest that single basal application of CRU constitutes a promising alternative N management practice for reducing N application rates, time- and labor-consuming in rice production in southeast China.},

	abstract = {Sand dune systems in the arid region of north-western China are maintained by sand-stabilizing vegetation, which provides critical ecosystem services. Limited knowledge of soil moisture recharge in these systems hinders sand stabilization efforts. To increase the understanding of soil moisture response to rainfall, we analysed soil water transport in the desert vadose zone of sand dunes and dune slacks following four natural rainfall events during the growing season of 2017. Rainfall was dominated by small rain events ({\textless}5.0 mm), accounting for 58\% of total rainfall events. Soil moisture at 5-25 cm depth in dune slacks was significantly higher and more variable to 60 cm depth than in sand dunes. Soil moisture at 5 cm depth was replenished with rainfall amounts of {\textless}5 mm in dune slacks, but not in sand dunes. When rainfall amount reached 20 mm, soil moisture in dune slack and in sand dune increased, but was much higher in dune slack than in sand dune at depth of 5 cm; after the rain, soil moisture remained at a relatively high level in dune slack but not in sand dune. This was possible because dune slacks had higher silt contents and root biomass, which played a key role in improving soil water holding capacity or accelerating rainfall infiltration at 0-25 cm depth. Overall, the rainfall-driven hydrological regime coupled with soil physical factors regulated spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in a sand dune system.},

This piece of work was conducted within the same study to find the long-term influence of biochar on the fertility of the soil, fixation of N-2, as well as the yie1d of chickpea under a mung-chickpea cropping system. A split plot arrangement was carried out by RCBD (Randomized Complete Block Design) to evaluate the study. Twenty-five kilograms of N ha(-1) were given as a starter dosage to every plot. Phosphorous and potassium were applied at two levels (half (45:30 kg ha(-1)) and full (90:60 kg ha(-1)) recommended doses) to each of the four biochar treatments. The chickpea crop parameters measured were the numbers and masses of the nodules, N-2 fixation and grain yield. Soil parameters recorded were Soil Organic Matter (SOM), total N and mineral N. The aforementioned soil parameters were recorded after harvesting. The results showed that nodulation in chickpea, grain yield and nutrient uptake were significantly enhanced by phosphorous and potassium mineral fertilizers. The application of biochar 95 tons ha(-1) significantly enhanced number of nodules i-e (122), however statistically similar response in terms of nodules number was also noted with treatment of 130 tons ha(-1). The results further revealed a significant difference in terms of organic matter (OM) (\%) between the half and full mineral fertilizer treatments. With the application of 130 tons ha(-1) of biochar, the OM enhanced from 1.67\% in the control treatment, to 2.59\%. However, total and mineral nitrogen were not statistically enhanced by the mineral fertilizer treatment. With regard to biochar treatments, total and mineral N enhanced when compared with the control treatment. The highest total N of 0.082\% and mineral nitrogen of 73 mg kg(-1) in the soil were recorded at 130 tons ha(-1) of biochar, while the lowest total N (0.049\%) and mineral nitrogen (54 mg kg(-1)) in the soil were recorded in the control treatment. The collaborative influence of mineral fertilizers and biochars was found to be generally non-significant for most of the soil and plant parameters. It could be concluded that the aforementioned parameters were greater for treatments receiving biochar at 95 tons or more per hectare over the last several years, and that the combination of lower doses of mineral fertilizers further improved the performance of biochar.},

The lack of comprehensive understanding of multi-layer SM hinders the sustainable development of agriculture, hydrology, and food security. In order to overcome the depth of traditional SM assimilation and downscaling methods, we developed a Two-step Multi-layer SM Downscaling (TMSMD) framework by fusing multi-source remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data through both machine learning and state-of-the-art deep learning models to generate multi-layer SM. The produced multi-layer SM characterized by high resolution (1 km), high spatio-temporal continuity (cloud-free and daily), and high curacy (i.e., 3H data). Firstly, the coarse resolution SMAP SM was downscaled to 1 km spatial resolution LightGBM to weaken the effects of scale mismatch issue and provide high-resolution input for the subsequent calibration. Results indicated that the downscaled SMAP SM remained high consistency with the original SM product. With the high-resolution inputs, we calibrated the downscaled SMAP SM using multi-layer SM through state-of-the-art attention-based LSTM. Results demonstrated that the average PCC, RMSE, ubRMSE, and MAE were improved by 22.3 \%, 50.7 \%, 26.2 \%, and 56.7 \% compared to SMAP L4 SM while 38.5 \%, 52.1 29.5 \%, and 58.7 \% compared to downscaled SMAP SM. Further spatio-temporal and comparative analysis confirmed that the multi-layer SM produced by the TMSMD framework had excellent performance in capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics. In conclude, the proposed TMSMD framework successfully generated multi-layer SM data and is promising for accurate assessment and monitoring in agriculture, water resources, environmental domains.},

Understanding their combined impact, especially in subtropical rice-potato cropping system, is crucial. This study delves into the economic feasibility and impact on soil fertility when adopting drip irrigation and straw mulching. Field experiments demonstrated that using rice straw as mulch significantly increased nutrient availability, with available nitrogen (N) increasing by 15\% to 17\%, available phosphorus (P) by 13\% to 14\%, and available potassium (K) by 31\% to 33\% compared to non-mulched conditions. Furthermore, compared to conventional irrigation, drip irrigation treatments resulted in significantly higher soil available N, with increases ranging from 6 to 8\% during the potato tuber initiation stage. Economic analysis showed that despite initial investment costs, adopting drip irrigation with straw mulch resulted in higher net returns. Rice-potato system with drip irrigation and straw mulch had a higher benefit-cost ratio, although it had a slighter shift in payback period than conventional practice. The research highlights sustainable intensification in rice-potato systems, suggesting strategic techniques for productivity and resource conservation to farmers and stakeholders.},

Also, stomatal conductance (Cd), transpiration rates (Tr), and intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) were highest with RFM, followed by RFR and RFC. Averaged across the two years, RFM conserved 10\% more soil water storage (SWS) than CK did at harvest, followed by RFR with an increment by 8\%. However, RFC consumed more soil water than CK did, with its ETc 8\% higher than CK. Consequently, spring maize treated with RFM suffered less drought stress, especially in 2017 when precipitation was insufficient. On average, grain yields and water use efficiency of RFM were increased by 18\% and 27\%, compared to CK. Structural equation modeling analysis showed that there existed significant positive correlation between SWS in top layers and grain yields, while SWS in deep layers had negative effects on grain yields. In conclusion, the incorporation of manure into ridge and furrow planting system can be an efficient agronomic practice to improve plant photosynthesis, optimize soil moisture, and boost grain yields in semi-arid areas of Loess Plateau, northwest China.},

	abstract = {Plant-plant facilitation is widely studied to increase productivity and resource utilization in cereal-legume intercropping system. However, physiological and ecological mechanisms driving interspecific interaction shift along the environmental gradients is largely unknown. To clarify this issue, we first tested plant-plant facilitation along with four phosphorus (P) gradients in maize-grass pea intercropping system. Results illustrated a progressive transition of seed yield-based facilitation from mutually facilitated (+/+) to maize facilitated but grass pea as facilitator (+/-) along with low to high P gradients. Secondly, above trend was evidently enhanced when combining with drought stress gradients, in which severe drought amplified facilitative effects, whereas the magnitude of facilitation was relatively weak under well-watered condition. Interestingly, biomass-based facilitation transition did not synchronize with seed-based one, in which occurred in a broader threshold range of water and P gradients. Specifically, total yield, biomass, N and P uptake increased by 0.5\%, 4.1\%, 1.8\% and 2.9\% under the sufficient P and water availability, whereas these indicators increased by 25.3\%, 18.5\%, 20.5\% and 21.4\% in P and water deficient soils. And the total net effect was positive under all the environmental conditions. Rhizosphere interaction plays a crucial role in facilitation judgment, and the driving mechanism was associated with soil acidification and microbial community promotion under P-deficient condition. Under low soil moisture and available P, soil acidification and lower rhizosphere soil pH of intercropped maize were observed. Rhizosphere phosphatase secretion were significantly activated in P-deficient soils and accelerated the mineralization of soil organophosphorus, and the microbial biomass P was improved for stronger facilitation. Taken together, our findings confirmed the P and water driven facilitation shift along with stress gradients and highlighted the roles of rhizosphere interaction in affecting species diversity advantage. In conclusion, our work provided a relatively full picture for plant facilitation evaluation and more accurate management regarding intercropping productivity.},

However, the key limitation of this method is in obtaining the calibration relationship between \& theta; and soil thermal conductivity (\& lambda;) across a specific field. In a previous study, a new methodology using a Gaussian processes model was presented to account for the spatial variability in the \& lambda;-\& theta; relationship. The model aggregated \& theta; measurements from soil moisture sensors scattered over the SPHP transect with the corresponding DTS \& lambda; measurements at their locations. In this study, a novel methodology is tested to optimize the number and locations of soil moisture sensors required to account for the spatial variability of the \& lambda;-\& theta; relationship to achieve higher accuracy from the SPHP technique. The proposed methodology utilizes hierarchical clustering to analyze the information contained in the spatial structure of the SPHP measurements as the soil dries from a nearly-saturated condition. The proposed methodology was tested using data from a field in Oklahoma. Monte-Carlo simulation was performed to validate the performance of the proposed methodology. The predictions obtained from the proposed methodology resulted in \& theta; measurements accuracy comparable to those obtained from the 10\% best Monte-Carlo iterations of randomly assigned soil moisture locations. This study demonstrates that the proposed methodology is more efficient than the traditional practice of randomly spreading calibration soil moisture sensors along the SPHP transect.},

Using soil moisture and meteorological data from 1984 to 2018, based on Mann-Kendall and Sen slope trend, two possible patterns of land-atmosphere interaction were discovered in the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), low soil moisture model with less precipitation and higher evapotranspiration, and high-temperature mode with less soil moisture and less evapotranspiration. To measure the hysteresis between soil moisture and precipitation, temperature, and evapotranspiration, a novel method named Three-Step Method was put out. The lag times were measured at ground stations spread across various climatic zones and timescales. The findings demonstrated that the lag times are generally controlled by the regional climate, with shorter lag times in drier regions. Both long-term and short-term responses were seen in soil moisture to meteorological variables. On a monthly scale, soil moisture correlated positively with precipitation but negatively with temperature and evapotranspiration. On an annual scale, precipitation (temperature, evapotranspiration) lagged by roughly 0 to 2 months in the upper and middle regions and by -2 to -6 months in the lower region of the YRB. The contribution rates of meteorological elements on soil moisture were enhanced by taking lag time into account. This study provides a unique perspective for better understanding climate process forecasts and related drought management by considering the hysteresis of soil moisture on the feedback and responses of climate variables.},

However, due to the inherent deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and seamless field-scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution, Accurate, Seamless data using Point-Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30 m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation accuracy, a pixel classification-based bias correction method was developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, -0.001, and 0.041 m(3)m(-3) respectively. After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13\%, 7\%, 22\%, and 18\%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field-scale seamless SSM, which is promising for fine-scale studies and applications in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.},

	abstract = {Accurate estimation of soil moisture content is necessary for optimal management of water and soil resources. Soil moisture is an important variable in the hydrologic cycle, which plays an important role in the global water and energy balance due to its impact on hydrological, ecological, and meteorological processes. The purpose of the present study was to explore a newly developed hybrid intelligent model for simulating soil moisture content. A hybrid adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model-grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was designed here and validated against the neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR) and standalone ANFIS models. The models input parameters were di-electric constant, soil bulk density, clay content and organic matter of 1155 soil samples. Various statistical indices were employed to evaluate the performances of the applied models. For a reliable ranking of models, the Global Performance Indicator (GPI) was utilized, which is a 5-agent index. The results evidenced the feasibility of the developed hybrid ANFIS-GWO model with superior simulation results. At the testing stage, the MAE and SI values for the ANFIS-GWO were 1.468\% and 0.098, respectively, which indicated the superiority of the ANFIS-GWO compared to the ANFIS-Fuzzy C mean (MAE = 6.427\%, SI = 0.354), and ANFIS-sub clustering (MAE = 2.137\%, SI = 0.141) models. Based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model was ranked as the best model, followed by the standalone ANFIS and SVR models, while the worst accuracy was attained through ANN model. The ANFIS-GWO model improved the simulation accuracy by 48\% and 50\%, respectively, compared to the standalone ANFIS and SVR models. In addition, based on the GPI, the ANFIS-GWO model presented an enhancement of about 77 percent compared to the ANN model. The high accuracy of the ANFIS-GWO model compared to the standalone ANFIS model represents the performance of the GWO algorithm for escaping local optima, which makes the ANFIS-GWO as a powerful tool for estimating soil moisture. Overall, the explored hybrid intelligent models demonstrated a reliable pedotransfer function of soil moisture where it can contribute to several geo-sciences engineering principles.},

For many of these studies, obtaining a sample of the source bedrock or applied mineral fertiliser for isotope analysis is impossible; meaning there is now a demand for a comprehensive characterisation of global bedrock delta O-18-PO4 to support this work. Here we compile delta O-18-PO4 data from a wide range of global bedrocks, including 56 new values produced as part of this study and a comprehensive overview of those within the previously existing literature. We present delta O-18-PO4 data from the range of major phosphatic lithologies alongside as much metadata for the samples as could be gathered. Much of the data comes from bedrocks of marine sedimentary origin ({\textless} 1 Ma = {\textgreater} +22 parts per thousand, {\textgreater} 540 Ma = approximate to +12 parts per thousand), but we also present data from bedrocks associated with guano (range: +19.5 to +15 parts per thousand) and igneous deposits (range: +12 to -0.8 parts per thousand), both of which have distinct delta O-18-PO4 signatures due to their formation mechanisms. We show that where repeat measurements of the same formation have been undertaken, regardless of method or exact sample location, there is an average within formation error of +/- 1.25 parts per thousand. This is important, as is constitutes a reasonable level of uncertainty for phosphorus cycling studies which need to estimate bedrock delta O-18-PO4 composition based on the literature. In combination, this data set presents 284 delta O-18-PO4 values from 56 countries; a comprehensive starting point for researchers interested in understanding bedrock end member delta O-18-PO4.},

To achieve real-time and nondestructive monitoring of the SWC, an experiment was conducted to measure the hyperspectral reflectance of soil samples with varying levels of water content. The soil samples were divided into two parts, SWC higher than field capacity (super-\& theta;(f)) and SWC lower than field capacity (sub-\& theta;(f)), and the outliers were detected by Monte Carlo cross-validation (MCCV). The raw spectra were processed using Savitzky-Golay (SG) smoothing and then the spectral feature variable of SWC was extracted by using a combination of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling (CARS) and random frog (Rfrog). Based on the extracted feature variables, an extreme learning machine (ELM), a back-propagation artificial neural network (BPANN), and a support vector machine (SVM) were used to establish the prediction model. The results showed that the accuracy of retrieving the SWC using the same model was poor, under two conditions, i.e., SWC above and below \& theta;(f), mainly due to the influence of the lower accuracy of the super-\& theta;(f) part. The number of feature variables extracted by the sub-\& theta;(f) and super-\& theta;(f) datasets were 25 and 18, respectively, accounting for 1.85\% and 1.33\% of the raw spectra, and the variables were widely distributed in the NIR range. Among the models, the best results were achieved by the BPANN model for both the sub-\& theta;(f) and the super-\& theta;(f) datasets; the R(2)p, RMSEp, and RRMSE of the sub-\& theta;(f) samples were 0.941, 1.570\%, and 6.685\%, respectively. The R(2)p, RMSEp, and RRMSE of the super-\& theta;(f) samples were 0.764, 1.479\%, and 4.205\%, respectively.

Here, we focus on the climate forcing, and in particular, the soil moisture change component which crucially determines water availability for crop uptake. We estimate future soil moisture levels at 34 sites of the UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS-UK) network. We do this by combining three platforms: the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model, field-scale soil moisture observations from the COSMOS-UK stations and 2.2 km convection-permitting UK Climate Projections (UKCP18). We use COSMOS-UK data to optimise key soil moisture-related parameters in the JULES model, based on its performance in the contemporary period. We then force the calibrated model with UKCP18 data to produce future soil moisture estimates. We evaluate the modelled soil moisture for an average soil depth between 0 and 35 cm to match the depth of soil moisture observations. Our main conclusions concern future soil moisture droughts which we compare with equivalent events in the historical period, 1982-2000. We find that on average across all sites, there is an increase in the frequency of future extreme soil moisture drought events of duration above 90 days. In 2062-80, such frequency increase of between 0.1 and 0.6 events per year (equivalent to at least 2 and up to 12 additional events in a 20-year period) is expected. We also show that, in 2062-80, there is an increased risk of high or more intense soil moisture drought conditions in months between May and November, with months between June and October being at especially high risk. The UKCP18 data corresponds to a high-emissions future described by the RCP8.5 scenario.},

In this study, the spatial changes of soil moisture, nutrients, and roots under different tillage modes, as well as the efficient utilization mechanism of soil moisture and nutrients from rain-fed maize on three mulching treatments (no surface covering, ridge film and straw mulch and ridge film mulch) and two slope treatments (5 degrees slope and 10 degrees slope) of sloping farmlands were studied at the Nationally Agricultural Environment Fuxin Observation and Experiment Station in China through a micro-zone simulation and a long-term positioning experiment. The results indicated that ridge film mulch and furrow seeding significantly improve the water use efficiency and partial factor productivity of the plants in sloping farmlands, with the highest increases being 51.33\% and 45.05\%. By analyzing the coordinated relationship between water, nutrients, and roots, it was found that ridge film furrow seeding technology can significantly affect the spatial distribution of water, nutrients, and roots in different soil layers, and improves the effective coefficient of soil water and nutrients. The effective coefficient of ridge film and straw treatment was 2.53, while the average value of the effective coefficient of ridge film treatment was 1.39. Further analysis found that the degree of consistency between the root system, water, and nutrient barycenter was highly correlated with the effective coefficients of water and nutrients. Visual radar map analysis revealed that root development limits the improvement availability of the efficient use of water and nutrients in the soil. Promoting root development indicators and root spatial distribution through ridge film coverage was an effective way to improve the efficient use of maize water and nutrients. The ridge film mulching promoted the root development index and root spatial distribution, thus improving the efficient use of water and nutrients in maize. Overall, the ranking of the regulation effect was as follows: ridge film and straw mulch {\textgreater} ridge film mulch {\textgreater} no mulch, and 5 degrees slope {\textgreater} 10 degrees slope.

	abstract = {Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an effective method to measure soil moisture at a horizontal scale of hundreds of metres and a depth of decimetres. Recent studies proposed operating CRNS in a network with overlapping footprints in order to cover root-zone water dynamics at the small catchment scale and, at the same time, to represent spatial heterogeneity. In a joint field campaign from September to November 2020 (JFC-2020), five German research institutions deployed 15 CRNS sensors in the 0.4 km(2) Wustebach catchment (Eifel mountains, Germany). The catchment is dominantly forested (but includes a substantial fraction of open vegetation) and features a topographically distinct catchment boundary. In addition to the dense CRNS coverage, the campaign featured a unique combination of additional instruments and techniques: hydro-gravimetry (to detect water storage dynamics also below the root zone); ground-based and, for the first time, airborne CRNS roving; an extensive wireless soil sensor network, supplemented by manual measurements; and six weighable lysimeters. Together with comprehensive data from the long-term local research infrastructure, the published data set (available at https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.756ca0485800474e9dc7f5949c63b872; Heistermann et al., 2022) will be a valuable asset in various research contexts: to advance the retrieval of landscape water storage from CRNS, wireless soil sensor networks, or hydrogravimetry; to identify scale-specific combinations of sensors and methods to represent soil moisture variability; to improve the understanding and simulation of land-atmosphere exchange as well as hydrological and hydrogeological processes at the hillslope and the catchment scale; and to support the retrieval of soil water content from airborne and spaceborne remote sensing platforms.},

	abstract = {Understanding soil moisture dynamics at the sub-kilometre scale is increasingly important, especially with the continuous development of hyper-resolution land surface and hydrological models. Cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNSs) are able to provide estimates of soil moisture at this elusive scale, and networks of these sensors have been expanding across the world over the previous decade. However, each network currently implements its own protocol when processing raw data into soil moisture estimates. As a consequence, this lack of a harmonised global data set can ultimately lead to limitations in the global assessment of the CRNS technology from multiple networks. Here, we present crspy, an open-source Python tool that is designed to facilitate the processing of raw CRNS data into soil moisture estimates in an easy and harmonised way. We outline the basic structure of this tool, discussing the correction methods used as well as the metadata that crspy can create about each site. Metadata can add value to global-scale studies of field-scale soil moisture estimates by providing additional routes to understanding catchment similarities and differences. We demonstrate that current differences in processing methodologies can lead to misinterpretations when comparing sites from different networks and that having a tool to provide a harmonised data set can help to mitigate these issues. By being open source, crspy can also serve as a development and testing tool for new understanding of the CRNS technology as well as being used as a teaching tool for the community.},

	abstract = {Water resources are scarce, and secondary soil salinization is severe in the Hetao Irrigation District. Farmland shelterbelt systems (FSS) play a critical role in regulating soil water and salt dynamics within the irrigation district. However, the understanding of soil water and salt migration within FSS during the freeze-thaw period remains unclear due to the complex and multifaceted interactions between water and salt. This study focused on a typical FSS and conducted comprehensive monitoring of soil moisture, salinity, temperature, and meteorological parameters during the freeze-thaw period. The results revealed consistent trends in air temperature and soil temperature overall. Soil freezing durations exceeded thawing durations, and both decreased with an increasing soil depth. At the three critical freeze-thaw nodes, the soil moisture content at a 0-20 cm depth was significantly lower than at a 40-100 cm depth (p {\textless} 0.05). The soil water content increased with time and depth at varying distances from the shelterbelt, with an average increase of 7.63\% after freezing and thawing. The surface water content at the forest edge (0.3H, 4H) was lower than inside the farmland (1H, 2H, 3H). Soil salt accumulation occurred during both freezing stable periods and melting-thawing periods in the 0-100 cm soil layer near the forest edge (0.3H, 4H), with the highest soil salinity reaching 0.62 g{\textless}middle dot{\textgreater}kg(-1). After the freeze-thaw period, the soil salt content in each layer increased by 11.41-47.26\% compared to before the freeze-thaw period. Salt accumulation in farmland soil near the shelterbelt was stronger than in the far shelterbelt. The multivariate statistical model demonstrated goodness of fit for soil water and salt as 0.94 and 0.72, respectively, while the BP neural network model showed goodness of fit for soil water and salt as 0.82 and 0.85, respectively. Our results provide an efficient theoretical basis for FSS construction and agricultural water management practices.},

	abstract = {Excessive synthetic N fertilization has resulted in severe soil degradation and high greenhouse gas emissions in agroecosystems. As a promising approach for achieving sustainable agriculture, partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer can affect the stoichiometric balance between organic C and inorganic N, thereby regulating nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes. However, the responses of soil N2O emissions and crop productivity to different ratios of organic fertilizer (OF) to synthetic fertilizer (SF) are still unclear, making the optimal fertilization scheme less accurate. A 2-year field experiment was conducted to measure soil properties, N2O emissions, and crop yields in a wheat-maize rotation system. Six fertilization managements were included: no fertilization (CK); total SF; and 15\%, 30\%, 45\%, and 100\% of organic substitution for synthetic fertilizers (LO, MO, HO, and OF), respectively. Compared to SF, soil annual cumulative N2O emissions in LO, MO, HO, and OF were significantly reduced by 16.2-20.5\%, 28.9-33.9\%, 33.2-42.2\%, and 70.2-74.9\% in two years, respectively. The mitigation of N2O emission with organic substitution was mainly attributed to the decreasing NO3 - and NH4+ contents and increasing soil pH. Meanwhile, soil organic C and total N were considerably higher in HO and OF than other treatments, with the lowest in CK in wheat season and in SF in maize season. Synthetic fertilizer and partial organic substitution increased the annual yield of wheat and maize compared with OF and CK in the first year, and HO increased the annual yield by 9.7\% and 37.6\% compared with SF and OF in the second year, respectively. The beneficial yield effects were mainly due to the enhanced synchronization of nutrient availability and soil fertility with partial organic substitution. Finally, the yield-scaled N2O emissions were reduced with increasing ratios of organic substitution in two years. Our study suggested that partial organic substitution for synthetic fertilizer, especially 45\% organic substitution would be feasible fertilization strategy to improve soil fertility and crop productivity while mitigating N2O emissions in wheat-maize rotation systems.},

Existing studies rarely considered using multi-source data and their sensitiveness to SM retrieval with few in-situ measurements. To solve this issue, we designed a SM retrieval method (Multi-MDA-RF) using random forest (RF) based on 29 features derived from passive microwave remote sensing data, optical remote sensing data, land surface models (LSMs), and other auxiliary data. To evaluate the importance of different features to SM retrieval, we first compared 10 filter or embedded type feature selection methods with sequential forward selection (SFS). Then, RF was employed to establish a nonlinear relationship between the in-situ SM measurements from sparse network stations and the optimal feature subset. The experiments were conducted in the continental U.S. (CONUS) using in-situ measurements during August 2015, with only 5225 training samples covering the selected feature subset. The experimental results show that mean decrease accuracy (MDA) is better than other feature selection methods, and Multi-MDA-RF outperforms the back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN), with the R and unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) values being 0.93 and 0.032 cm(3)/cm(3), respectively. In comparison with other SM products, Multi-MDA-RF is more accurate and can well capture the SM spatial dynamics.},

Soil moisture data retrieved from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) onboard the Meteorological Operational Satellite was assimilated into GDAPS-KIM using the ensemble Kalman filter method, and its impacts were evaluated for the 2019 boreal summer period. Our results indicated that the soil moisture data assimilation improved the agreement of the observations with the initial conditions of GDAPS-KIM. This led to a statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of the initial fields. A comparison of a five-day forecast against an ERA5 reanalysis and in situ observations revealed a reduction in the dry and warm biases of GDAPS-KIM over the surface and in the lower- and mid-level atmospheres. The temperature bias correction through the initialization of the soil moisture estimates from the data assimilation system was shown in the five-day weather forecast (root mean squared errors reduction of the temperature at 850 hPa by approximately 5\% in East Asia).},

	abstract = {The Bayesian Maximum Entropy (BME) algorithm that can model larger-scale spatial heterogeneity and integrate multiple types of data is a better spatial estimation algorithm in avoiding the circular problem and improving the estimation accuracy of parameters than original empirical geostatistic and spatial statistic methods. To obtain higher-resolution and higher-accuracy soil moisture (SM) data, this study used the BME algorithm to integrate the multiple environmental factor variables related to SM as auxiliary data (11 data sets in total) such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Land Surface Temperature (LST), and Albedo products with 1 kilometre (km) grid resolution from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer Global Digital Elevation Model (ASTER GDEM) satellite data, and the Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, Relief amplitude products generated from ASTER GDEM data. First, the FengYun 3-B satellite (FY3-B) SM product with 25 km grid resolution was downscaled to 1 km grid resolution using the visible, infrared (IR), and microwave fusion method. The downscaled FY3-B SM data and auxiliary data were used to generate the weighted probability soft data (SD) under four cases, case 1: 500 sample points of SD, case 2: 450 sample points of SD, case 3: 400 sample points of SD, and case 4: 350 sample points of SD. Particularly, we used two methods, the multivariable correlation analysis method and principal component analysis (PCA) method to get the weight values of environmental factor variables, i.e. NDVI, LST, Albedo, the Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Slope, Aspect, Plan curvature, Profile curvature, Surface roughness, Wetness index, and Relief amplitude with SM. Then, thein-situSM measurements as hard data (HD) were used to calibrate the weighted probability SD in the procedure of BME SM estimation. The SM under four cases were estimated from the weighted probability SD and HD using BME algorithm. Finally, comparisons of the estimated SM using BME algorithm within-situSM measurements at maize study area were carried out in this study. Our results indicated that the accuracy of the estimated SM using BME algorithm, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.049 cm(3) cm(-3), the correlation coefficient (r) = 0.639, the unbiased RMSE (RMSEu) = 0.047 cm(3) cm(-3), and Bias = 0.002 cm(3) cm(-3), under case 1 based on PCA method was obviously better than the downscaled FY3-B SM (RMSE = 0.079 cm(3) cm(-3),r= 0.096, RMSEu = 0.069 cm(3)cm(-3), and Bias = 0.039 cm(3)cm(-3)) that was generated by the visible, IR, and microwave fusion method. We concluded that integrating auxiliary data into SM estimation using BME algorithm could further improve the downscaled FY3-B SM that was generated by visible, IR, and microwave fusion method.},

	abstract = {Intensive cultivation of `uala (sweet potato) in the Leeward Kohala field system on Hawai'i Island supported substantial populations of Native Hawaiians prior to its abandonment in the 19th century. Productivity is influenced by the heterogeneity of the climate and biogeochemical soil characteristics across the substantial ecological gradient. Agricultural infrastructure and associated practices were developed to manage crop production eventuating from the variation in inter- and intra-annual rainfall. Mechanisms of sustaining soil nitrogen (N) are still unclear; however, a pronounced source of N is soil organic matter decomposition. This study investigated in situ the effects of indigenous Hawaiian mulching practices against two control treatments on soil moisture and temperature dynamics to facilitate N mineralization in soil mounds cultivated with `uala. Field experiments were set in two agricultural restoration plots with distinct climatic and soil characteristics. Data included soil moisture and temperature, soil and plant N, growth and development of `uala, and real-time weather data. Concurrently, N mineralization was also investigated under controlled conditions. All indigenous mulching treatments were found to significantly increase soil moisture, regulate temperature variation, and improve N availability compared to control. Differences in soil properties between treatments translated to significant differences in above-ground biomass. The data suggest that these differences would extend to tuber production, but the use of a long-gestation variety limited tuber production in the study. Increased temperatures in the controlled experiments were observed to increase inorganic N significantly, but less substantially than soil moisture. Indigenous practices in the region could have greatly mitigated plant stress due to moisture, temperature, and N availability, increasing productivity and reducing the variability of the Leeward Kohala Field System.},

A mix of indices and spatial algorithm-based remote sensing methodologies were applied on Landsat 8 satellite images to extract information on the mentioned surface components and processes. The empirical study suggests that since 2017 land use has become progressively diverse in pattern. A decrease of 6.16\% in vegetation cover, respectively, with increased grassland and built-up by 5.13\% and 1.79\% for the whole of Cox's Bazar, has been observed during the 5 years. The significant changes are evident in the Kutupalong campsite alone, experiencing an 80.32\% decrease in its total forest lands resulting from more than a four-time increase in Rohingya settlements within 2 years. With an overall accuracy of 87\%, the findings are consistent with global LULC change patterns. Statistical and correlation analyses were used to explore the LST, SM, and ET. The results illustrate that the highly populated areas are associated with the highest LST and lowest ET, and vice versa. The maximum temperature observed is during the peak refugee intrusion period of 2017, ranging between 20.29-35.89 degrees C and 20.87-34.96 degrees C, respectively, for January and December. SM content was estimated for bare lands, and the obtained information indicates that dense human settlement directly and negatively impacts this variable. As a result, land in the entire Rohingya campsite is subject to a shift from moderate to mostly dry soil conditions. Evapotranspiration showed a linear trend with SM change and has decreased over the period.},

Although they have been extensively studied in the North China Plain (NCP), an exploration into their spatial-temporal coupling pattern remains absent. Here, the spatial-temporal coupling pattern underlying the variations of Iwr and SM across the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system within the NCP was elucidated from a geographic perspective, by developing a geo-statistic framework that integrated the global spatial autocorrelation, spatial hot-spot technique, geographically weighted regression, and the optimal parameters-based geographic detector. From 2000-2019, the Iwr and SM exerted a distinct geo-spatial heterogeneity. Winter wheat demonstrated a spatially descending gradient in Iwr from north to south, while the pattern in summer maize Iwr varied greatly across periods. Generally, winter wheat had a higher Iwr, while the geospatial pattern of summer maize Iwr displayed a greater variability. Spatial pattern of SM in 0-100 cm soil horizon exhibited an approximately inverse trajectory to that of Iwr, while SM in 100-200 cm horizon demonstrated a spatial staggered pattern. In most cases, there existed a notable negative coupling between Iwr and SM at 0-100 cm depth, but not universal at 100-200 cm. Nonetheless, a pronounced reciprocal enhancement mechanism between SM of two layers was confirmed. Between 2000 and 2019, a geospatial decoupling trend was detected between Iwr and SM throughout the NCP. Despite remaining universality, the pattern of high irrigation demand induced by soil moisture deficit was being weakened. Given these, climate-adaptive water-saving strategies were updated, which provide a new implication for regional agricultural water-saving practice and sustainable production.},

In this work, NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy was used to correct the fluorescence spectra of PAHs in order to reduce the effect of the soil moisture. To establish the correction method, eight soil samples with different moisture contents and a given phenanthrene concentration (8 mg/g) were prepared. The fluorescence and NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were collected for of all samples. It was found that the fluorescence spectra of the soil samples that vary with the moisture content together with the NIR diffuse reflectance spectra were considered for the correction of the fluorescence intensity of phenanthrene related to the moisture content. The results showed that the ratio of the fluorescence intensity at 384 nm to the NIR diffuse reflectance spectrum absorbance at 5184 cm(-1) can be used as a correction factor to reduce the effect of the soil moisture on the fluorescence intensity of phenanthrene in the soil. The validity of the correction method was verified by the quantitative analysis of PAHs with different concentrations and soil moisture contents. The results showed better linearity between the fluorescence intensity and the concentration of PAHs after the correction (with a correlation coefficient R of 0.99) than before the correction (with R of 0.86). The relative prediction errors for three unknown samples decreased from 19\%, 51\% and 40\% before the correction to 5\%, 13\% and 0.44\% after the correction, respectively, indicating the feasibility of the detection of PAHs in the soil by the combination of fluorescence and NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy.

Satellite-based analyses have grown in fidelity and duration, offering an independent observationally based alternative. However, satellite-retrieved SM time series include random and periodic errors that degrade estimates of land-atmosphere coupling, including correlations with other variables. This study proposes a mathematical approach to adjust daily time series of the European Space Agency (ESA) Climate Change Initiative (CCI) satellite SM product using information from physically based land surface model (LSM) datasets using a Fourier transform time-filtering method to match the temporal power spectra locally to the LSMs, which tend to agree well with in situ observations. When the original and timely adjusted SM products are evaluated against ground-based SM measurements over the conterminous United States, Europe, and Australia, results show the adjusted SM has significantly improved subseasonal variability. The skill of the adjusted SM is increased in temporal correlation by similar to 0.05 over all analysis domains without introducing spurious regional patterns, affirming the stochastic nature of noise in satellite estimates, and skill improvement is found for nearly all land cover classes, especially savannas and grassland. Autocorrelation-based soil moisture memory (SMM) and the derived random component of soil moisture error (SME) are used to investigate the improvement of SM features. The time filtering reduces the random noise from the satellite-based SM product that is not explainable by physically based SM dynamics; SME is usually diminished and the increased SMM is generally statistically significant.},

Changes of all soil P fractions were indicating the occurrence of soil P transformation and movement over the time. The resin-extractable P, H2O-extractable and NaOH-extractable P were significantly increased under long-term P fertilization. The highest P applied soil had the highest total phosphorus (PT) contents. Also the percent distribution of Ca and Mg-bound P CaMgP, humic HaP and fulvic acid, and FaP increased with P fertilizer level increases. The other extraction P level did not increase vary consistently with increasing levels of P fertilization. Also soil P lability except soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), KCl extractable phosphorus (EP), and particulate organic phosphorus (POP) increased consistently by P fertilization. Increasing P fertilization significantly (p {\textless} .001) increased the phosphorus management index (PMI) of extracted P fractions except for EP. The work demonstrated that P under long-term corn-wheat treated soils changed as a result of changes in labile P fractions probably due to the solubilization of residual fertilizer P joined with corn/wheat crop rotation factors.

	abstract = {Evaluating the interactions between above- and below-ground processes is important to understand and quantify how ecosystems respond differently to atmospheric forcings and/or perturbations and how this depends on their intrinsic characteristics and heterogeneity. Improving such understanding is particularly needed in snow-impacted mountainous systems where the complexity in water and carbon storage and release arises from strong heterogeneity in meteorological forcing and terrain, vegetation and soil characteristics. This study investigates spatial and temporal interactions between terrain, soil moisture, and plant seasonal dynamics at the intra- and inter-annual scale along a 160 m long mountainous, non-forested hillslope-to-floodplain system in the upper East River Watershed in the upper Colorado River Basin. To this end, repeated UAV-based multi-spectral aerial imaging, ground-based soil electrical resistivity imaging, and soil moisture sensors were used to quantify the interactions between above and below-ground compartments. Results reveal significant soil-plant co-dynamics. The spatial variation and dynamics of soil water content and electrical conductivity, driven by topographic and soil intrinsic characteristics, correspond to distinct plant types, with highest plant productivity in convergent areas. Plant productivity in heavy snow years benefited from more water infiltration as well as a shallow groundwater table depth. In comparison, low snowpack years with an early first bare-ground date, which are linked to an early increase in plant greenness, imply a short period of saturated conditions that leads to lower average and maximum greenness values during the growing season. Overall, these results emphasize the strong impact of snowpack dynamics, and terrain and subsurface characteristics on the heterogeneity in plant type and seasonal dynamics.},

	abstract = {Straw returning and livestock manure reuse are effective nature-based solutions (NBS) for nutrient cycling and sustainable crop production. However, it remains unclear how these agricultural practices affect phosphorus (P) transformation, movement, and the risk of loss in long-term crop production. The present study assessed the 30-year effects of the following five fertilizer treatments on rice yield, P transformation, movement, and loss in the soil profile: control (no fertilizer), NPK (chemical fertilizer), NPK + S (NPK with straw returning), NPK + M (NPK with manure), and NPK1.5 + S (1.5-folds NPK with straw returning). Compared with the NPK treatment, the NPK + S, NPK + M, and NPK1.5 + S treatments demonstrated no further increase in rice grain yield but significantly increased the seasonal soil P surplus by 3.3, 6.0, and 16.8 kg P ha-1, respectively. Compared with NPK, the soil Olsen-P concentration in the 0-0.2 m soil layer increased by 24.5 and 89.7\% respectively for NPK + S and NPK1.5 + S. The environmental soil P threshold for the rice-wheat rotation system in Purpli-Udic Cambisol is 49.9 mg kg-1. The straw returning treatment (NPK + S and NPK1.5 + S) continually maintained a higher P index (9.5-13.5) in the 0-0.3 m soil layers. These results suggested that an integrative P strategy should be provided to manage soil P surplus and P environmental loss risk in the chemical combined with organic fertilizers of rice-wheat rotation, ensuring sustainable food security and achieving NBS goals.},

Here, microbial functions related to nitrogen fixation, nitrification and denitrification as well as bacterial, archaeal and fungal populations were evaluated in a long-term field experiment in which tropical forage grasses palisade grass (Urochloa brizantha (Hochst. Ex A. Rich.) R.D. Webster) and ruzigrass (U. ruziziensis (R. Germ. and C.M. Evrard) Crins) were cultivated with or without N fertilization. Uncultivated soil was used as a control. Forage grasses, especially palisade grass, increased soil bacterial and fungal abundances, whereas the archaeal population was highest in uncultivated soil. In soils cultivated with forage grasses, N fertilization favored N-cycle-related genes; however, cultivation of palisade grass increased the abundances of amoA bacteria (AOB) and amoA archaea (AOA) genes associated with soil nitrification and decreased the abundances of genes nirS, nirK and nosZ genes related to denitrification, compared to ruzigrass and control, regardless of N input. In addition, abundances of total bacteria and total fungi were associated with the N cycle and plant biomass in soils cultivated with forage grasses. Forage cultivation clearly benefitted the soil nutrient environment (S-SO42-, Mg2+, total-C and -N, N-NO3- and N-NH4+) and microbiome (bacteria and fungi) compared with uncultivated soil. In soil cultivated with palisade grass, the microbial community composition was unresponsive to N addition. The high N uptake by palisade grass supports the competitive advantage of this plant species over microorganisms for N sources. Our results suggest that palisade grass has advantages over ruzigrass for use in agriculture systems, regardless of N input.},

A total of 800 different soil samples and hyperspectral data were collected in the laboratory and from the field. A hyperspectral database was established. After wavelet denoising and principal component analysis (PCA) preprocessing, the convolutional neural network (CNN) module was first used to extract the wavelength features of the data. Then, the long- and short-memory neural network (LSTM) module was used to extract the feature bands and nearby hidden state vectors. At the same time, the genetic algorithm (GA) was used to optimize the hyperparametric weight and bias value of the LSTM training network. At the initial stage, the data were normalized, and all features were analyzed by grey correlation degree to extract important features and to reduce the computational complexity of the data. Then, the GA-optimized CNN-LSTM hybrid neural network (GA-CNN-LSTM) algorithm model proposed in this paper was used to predict soil moisture and organic matter. The prediction performance was compared with CNN, support vector regression (SVR), and CNN-LSTM hybrid neural network model without GA optimization. The GA-CNN-LSTM algorithm was superior to other models in all indicators. The highest accuracy rates of 94.5\% and 92.9\% were obtained for soil moisture and organic matter, respectively. This method can be applied to portable hyperspectrometers and unmanned aerial vehicles to realize large-scale monitoring of moisture and organic matter distribution and to provide a basis for rational irrigation and fertilization in the future.},

Br.]-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system is the most important system under irrigated conditions. However, it is very exhaustive cropping system and productivity of pearl millet-wheat system has become constant or marginally declined for the last three decades. The imbalanced use of fertilizers and high intensity farming activities declined the soil nutrient status and also deteriorate physical and biological properties of soil. Therefore, to maintain soil health and productivity, balanced fertilization based on soil testing is very essential. A study of balanced fertilization based on Soil Test Crop Response (STCR) approach was initiated in 2009 at Research Farm, CCSHAU, Hisar, with seven treatments viz. T-1-control, T-2-farm yard manure (FYM) @ 15 t ha(-1), T-3-recommended dose of nitrogen and phosphorus (RDN and P), T-4-STCR with target yield (TY) 3.0 t ha(-1), T-5-STCR with TY 3.5 t ha(-1), T-6-integrated STCR with TY 3.0 t ha(-1) + FYM and T-7-integrated STCR with TY 3.5 t ha(-1) + FYM. Integrated treatment (T-7) recorded the highest crop grain and straw yield followed by chemical fertilizers alone (T-3-T-5) whereas lowest grain and straw yield was found in control (T-1) after 10 cycles of pearl millet-wheat system. Application of FYM along with chemical fertilizers enhanced total N, P and K uptake by approximately 150, 192 and 150\% respectively, over the control. However, soil organic carbon (SOC) and available nutrients were found maximum at early developmental stages and decreased at maturity. The long-term balanced nutrient management using STCR approach has improved soil nutrient status, SOC, pearl millet yield, nutrient uptake and use efficiency of fertilizers.},

	abstract = {An accurate assessment of soil water balance components (SWBCs) is necessary for improving irrigation strategies in any water-limited environment. However, quantitative information on SWBCs is usually challenging to obtain, because none of the components (i.e., irrigation, drainage, and evapotranspiration) can be easily measured under actual conditions. Soil moisture is a variable that integrates the water balance components of land surface hydrology, and the evolution of soil moisture is assumed to contain the memory of antecedent hydrologic fluxes, and can thus be used to determine SWBCs from a hydrologic balance. A database of soil moisture measurements from six experimental plots with different treatments in the middle Heihe River basin of China was used to test the potential of a such a database for estimating SWBCs. We first compared the hydrophysical properties of the soils in these plots, such as vertical saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) and soil water retention features, for supporting SWBC estimations. We then determined evapotranspiration and other SWBCs using a method that combined the soil water balance method and the inverse Richards equation (a model of unsaturated soil water flow based on the Richards equation). To test the accuracy of our estimation, we used both indirect methods (such as power consumption of the pumping irrigation well and published SWBCs values at nearby sites) and the water balance equation technique to verify the estimated SWBCs values, all of which showed good reliability with respect to our estimation method. Finally, the uncertainties of the proposed methods were analyzed to evaluate the systematic error of the SWBC estimation and any restrictions regarding its application. The results showed significant variances among the film-mulched plots in both the cumulative irrigation volumes (652.1-867.3 mm) and deep drainages (170.7-364.7 mm). Moreover, the un-mulched plot had remarkably higher values in both cumulative irrigation volumes (1186.5 mm) and deep drainages (651.8 mm) compared with the mulched plots. Obvious correlation existed between the volume of irrigation and that of drained water. However, the ET demands for all of the plots behaved pretty much the same, with the cumulative ET values ranging between 489.1 and 561.9 mm for the different treatments in 2016, suggesting that the superfluous irrigation amounts had limited influence on the accumulated ET throughout the growing season due to the poor water-holding capacity of the sandy soil. This work confirmed that relatively reasonable estimations of the SWBCs in coarse-textured sandy soils can be derived by using soil moisture measurements; the proposed methods provided a reliable solution over the entire growing season and showed a great potential for identifying appropriate irrigation amounts and frequencies, and thus a move toward sustainable water resources management, even under traditional surface irrigation conditions.},

	abstract = {Cassava is an important source of food security and livelihoods for millions of consumers daily. Water deficit conditions are one of the major factors that affect the development of root system architecture (RSA) and consequently, crop productivity, and yet, due to its long maturity periods and bulky storage root systems, RSA studies in cassava are uncommon. The objective of this study was to identify traits that are responsible for the variability and plastic responses of cassava in response to drought at the juvenile stage of growth. Eight cassava genotypes were grown in soil-filled pots under well-watered and droughted conditions for up to 45 days and multivariate analyses employed to determine the major contributory traits to variability and the relative distance plasticity index (RDPI) was computed to evaluate plasticity. There were significant genotypic variations for most of the traits measured. Drought generally inhibited root production and development and the degree of inhibition was between 2 and 22\%. Regardless of the soil moisture condition, traits which differentiated the RSA included root biomass, root numbers, root branching density, and total root length, and these were also the important contributory traits to variability under well-watered soil conditions. Important contributory traits to variability traits under drought were shoot-related traits such as leaf area and shoot biomass, and also root system traits such as nodal root number, root biomass, diameter and branching density. Phenotypic plasticity was found in most traits where the number, branching density and diameter of upper nodal roots presented the highest RDPI. These traits corresponded with the traits contributing greatly to variation. Plastic responses of cassava to drought were dependent on trait and genotype. It is concluded that upper nodal roots-related traits could have importance in breeding cassava to better tolerate water deficit conditions. The secondary growth and ability to maintain or increase the upper nodal root count or density under limited soil moisture may be related to good growth and yield performance of cassava under drought conditions. Upper nodal roots could be used to screen and select cassava genotypes adapted to drought at the juvenile stage but as a potential indirect selection strategy, the persistence and pertinence of these traits and their relationship with yield and yield components under drought conditions in the field must be confirmed.},

In this study, we investigated how the soil microbial community affects root zone productivity in winter wheat. We also verified whether productivity can be improved by water adjustment and N management in drip irrigation field experiments (I0, natural condition; I1, jointing to heading stage S1 55\%-80\%theta(f), field capacity, anthesis to mature stage S2 70\%-80\%theta(f); I2, S1 55\%-90\%theta(f), S2 70\%-90\%theta(f); and I3, S1 55\%-100\%theta(f), S2 70\%-100\%theta(f)) and under different N application rates (N0, N1, N2, and N3 represent 0, 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha(-1)). Soil moisture and N application rate significantly influenced water use efficiency (WUE), N use efficiency (NUE), yield, and soil bacterial abundance and diversity in the wheat root zone. N application decreased the richness indices in un-irrigated soils (I0), whereas it initially increased, and then decreased the indices in irrigated soils (I1, I2, and I3). The primary factor influencing the dominant bacterial taxa was soil moisture content (SMC), followed by root length density (RLD). The root system and soil bacterial diversity strong influenced wheat yield. The I1N1 treatment resulted in the highest root weight density (RWD), WUE, and NUE, and thus increased wheat yield; furthermore, it had the least influence on the diversity of soil bacteria. Our work suggests that the response of bacterial communities to soil moisture and nitrogen content largely regulates crop production in agro-ecosystems, and that regulating soil moisture and nitrogen fertilizer use may provide a sustainable solution for maintaining farmland productivity.},

Eleven soil properties, i.e., electrical conductivity (EC), soil organic carbon (SOC), total nitrogen (TN), calcium carbonate equivalent (CCE), available phosphorus (P-av), exchangeable potassium (K-ex), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), and soil pH, were measured in the samples. The Nutrient Index Value (NIV) was calculated based on wheat nutritional requirements. The results indicated that 100\%, 93\%, and 74\% of the study areas for CCE, pH, and EC fell into the low, moderate, and moderate to high NIV classes, respectively. Also, 25\% of the area is classified as low fertility (NIV {\textless} 1.67), 75\% falls under medium fertility (1.67 {\textless} NIV value {\textless} 2.33), and none in high fertility (NIV value {\textgreater} 2.33). Assessment of the mean wheat yield (AWY) and its comparison with NIV showed that the highest yield was in the Ramhormoz region (5200 kg.ha(-1)), while the lowest yield was in the Hendijan region (3000 kg.ha(-1)) with the lowest EC rate in the study area. Elevated levels of salinity and CCE in soils had the most negative impact on irrigated WY, while P-av, TN, and Mn availability showed significant effects on crop production. Therefore, implementing SF management practices is essential for both quantitative and qualitative improvement in irrigated wheat production in Khuzestan province.},

	abstract = {Dry periods in semi-arid regions constitute one of the greatest hazardous features that agriculture faces. This study investigates the effects of using a new device called `Hydroinfiltrator Rainwater Harvesting System (HRHS) on the water balance of soils. It was designed for arid and semi-arid zones affected by long periods of drought punctuated by heavy rainstorms. The new hydroinfiltrator consists of a net-like shell filled mainly with biochar. It is cylindrical in shape, is placed vertically and is half-buried in the soil around the crop tree to facilitate the infiltration of rainwater, irrigation or runoff water deep into the soil. The experimental plot is located in Baena (C \& PRIME;ordoba, southern Spain) in an olive grove where the hydroinfiltrator was installed in 90 olive trees while 10 were left as a control group. In the xeric climate (bordering on arid), typical of the region, soils without a hydroinfiltrator have had a low infiltration rate, which reduces the effectiveness of precipitation and significantly increases the risk of water erosion. The effects of infiltration assisted by the device were analysed by simulating a torrential rain in which 600 L of water were passed through the hydroinfiltrator on an olive tree which had been installed 3 years previously. Geophysical methods (electrical resistivity tomography, ERT), direct analyses of soil samples, both in situ and in the laboratory, and theoretical flow models indicated a very significant increase in soil moisture (which nearly tripled in respect to the control group) because water was absorbed into the soil quickly, preventing runoff and water erosion. The soil moisture at 20 cm depth was 2.97 times higher with the HRHS than in the control plots. In addition, olive production increased by 211\% and was higher in fat yield by 177\%. Moreover, the resistivity profiles, taken by ERT showed that the water that entered the soil accumulated in the root zone of the olive tree, encouraged by the preferential pathways created by the roots and away from the surface, which prevented rapid evaporation during the high temperatures of spring and summer. Here we show for the first time that the use of the hydroinfiltrator rainwater harvesting system represents a significant improvement in the use of scarce water resources caused by climate change, providing agronomic and environmental benefits for rainfed, Mediterranean agricultural systems.},

	abstract = {Lake fluctuations in river-lake-basin (RLB) systems are highly complex because of the significant interactions of various hydrological variables. Clarifying these interactions would be helpful for understanding the physical mechanisms of lake fluctuations and improving responses to extreme hydrological events (i.e., drought or flood). Though numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the flow between rivers and lakes (river-lake interaction), research on the hydrological processes between a lake and its surrounding basin (lake-basin interaction) remains rare. This study investigates lake-basin interactions by examining the changes in the water distribution between the land and a lake with an examination of the Poyang Lake region, China. Specifically, this study first estimates water storage by employing the water balance model. Then, the spatial and temporal correlations between the lake area and soil moisture are examined to capture the lake-land interaction. The results show that the region's annual water storage has decreased in recent decades and varies in different months. Specifically, more water in the region is stored in the lake before July, and increasing amounts of water are held on land after that. Spatially, soil moisture is low in the region near the lake in summer because of the high radiation of water reflectance, which enhances evapotranspiration. By contrast, soil moisture is high in other seasons because of the flow from top to bottom. It can be concluded that soil moisture could mitigate the change in water storage due to the shrinkage of Poyang Lake, which is characterized by significant spatial and temporal variabilities. The results of this study help elucidate the dynamics and distribution of water resources in similar RLB systems, support water management and promote local sustainable development.},

At present there is little information available con-cerning the relationship between the tillage system applied and the soil moisture tension, penetration resistance, soil moisture content, and temperature responses to the temporal variability of precipita-tion under the semi-arid Mediterranean environment. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of standard tillage (plough-ing to 25-35 cm) and conservation tillage shallow (loosening to 10 cm) on temporal changes in the three properties in response to the precipitation pattern in Croatia. The temporal changes in soil moisture tension were determined using Watermark sensors (at 15 and 30 cm), and penetration resistance (at 0-30 cm) was deter-mined with an Eijkelkamp penetrometer in spring under winter wheat. After heavy precipitation, the soil moisture tensions were similar irrespective of the tillage system used and the measure-ment depth, while with the increasing length of the period without precipitation (using the last precipitation incident as the starting timepoint), the soil moisture tensions increased to a greater extent under conservation tillage shallow as compared to standard tillage. The temporal changes in soil moisture tension in response to pre-cipitation were less sensitive at the 30 than at the 15 cm depth. The adoption of conservation tillage shallow increased the amount of topsoil organic matter as compared to standard tillage. This study indicates that conservation tillage shallow is a promising practice in terms of soil quality improvement and crop productivity under highly variable Mediterranean climate conditions.},

This study applies the triple collocation (TC) method to conduct a cross-evaluation of SM data from ERA5 reanalysis estimates, ESA-CCI estimates, and similar to 2000 ground stations across the China domain. The results show that all datasets can capture the spatial pattern of SM in China. TC-based correlation coefficient (CC) and root mean square error (RMSE) show that the station data have worse performance in western and central China. For most stations, TC-based CC is between 0.6 similar to 0.9, and TC-based RMSE is between 0.01 similar to 0.06 m(3)/m(3). In addition, TC-based metrics show good agreement with the CC between precipitation and SM, indicating that these metrics can reflect the quality of station data. We further selected typical stations (e.g., CC {\textless}= 0.2, RMSE {\textgreater}= 0.06 m(3)/m(3)) to check the quality of the QC procedure. The comparison shows that TC-based metrics can better represent the actual quality for these stations compared to raw QC flags. This study indicates that TC has the potential to detect problematic stations and could be a supplement to traditional QC of station observations.},

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the performance of proposed bioretention facilities regarding road runoff pollutant removal and the variation characteristics of the media physicochemical properties and microbial diversity in dry-cold regions. Two types of bioretention facilities were designed and then constructed in Tianjin Eco-city, China, on the basis of combined soil filter media screened by a laboratory-scale test with a modified bioretention facility (MBF) containing soil moisture conservation ropes. Redundancy analysis was performed to evaluate the relationships between the variation in media physicochemical properties and microbial communities. An increase in media moisture could promote an increase in the relative abundance of several dominant microbial communities. In the MBF, the relatively low nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) (0.75 mg/L) and total nitrogen (TN) (4.71 mg/L) effluent concentrations, as well as better removal efficiencies for TN and NO3-N in challenge tests, were mainly attributed to the greater relative abundance of Proteobacteria (25.2\%) that are involved in the microbial nitrogen transformation process. The MBF also had greater media microbial richness (5253 operational taxonomic units) compared to the conventional bioretention facility and in situ saline soils. The results indicate that stormwater runoff treated by both bioretention facilities has potential use for daily greening and road spraying. The proposed design approach for bioretention facilities is applicable to LID practices and sustainable stormwater management in other urban regions.},

	abstract = {Global, long-term, gap-free, high quality soil moisture products are extremely important for hydrological monitoring and climate change research. However, soil moisture products produced from satellite observations have data gaps due to the limited capabilities of satellite orbit/swath and retrieval algorithms, which limit the regional and global applications of soil moisture data in hydrology and agriculture studies. To solve this problem, we proposed a gap-filling method to reconstruct a global gap-free surface soil moisture product by applying the machine learning (Random Forest) algorithm on a pixel-by-pixel basis, taking into account the nonlinear relationship between surface soil moisture and the related surface environmental variables. The gap-filling method was applied to the NN-SM surface soil moisture product, which has a fraction of data gaps of around 50\% globally on a multi-year average. A global daily gap-free surface soil moisture dataset from 2002 to 2020 was then generated. The reconstructed values of several sub-regions after manually eliminating the original values were cross-verified with the original data, and this clearly demonstrated the reliability of the reconstruction method with the correlation coefficient (R) ranging between 0.770 and 0.918, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between 0.057 and 0.082 m(3)/m(3), the unbiased Root Mean Square Error (ubRMSE) between 0.053 and 0.081 m(3)/m(3), and Bias between -0.012 and 0.008 m(3)/m(3). The accuracy of the reconstructed surface soil moisture dataset was evaluated using in situ observations of surface soil moisture at 12 sites from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research (LTAR) network, and the results showed good accuracy in terms of R (0.610), RMSE (0.067 m(3)/m(3)), ubRMSE (0.045 m(3)/m(3)) and Bias (0.031 m(3)/m(3)). Overall, the reconstructed surface soil moisture dataset retained the characteristics of the NN-SM product, such as high accuracy and good spatiotemporal pattern. However, with the advantage of continuous spatiotemporal coverage, it is more suitable for further applications in the analysis of global surface soil moisture trends, land surface hydrological processes, and land-atmosphere energy and water exchanges, etc.},

A wet soil sample was prepared by exposing the water mist generated from the ultrasonic humidifier to dry soil for 0-95 min to reach the soil water content to 0-30 mass\%. Calibration curves of six hazardous metals (Cr, As, Se, Cd, Hg, and Pb) measured from the soil certified reference materials JSAC 0461 to 0466 were compared with the water content changed from 0 to 30 mass\%. The inclinations of calibration curves of six metals decreased with the increase of the water content. In addition, the XRF intensities of six metals decreased about 15\%-20\% by adding the water in 30 mass\%. It was revealed that the soil moisture effect is caused by two factors as a decrease of the amount of analyte in the XRF generating area, and a change in the sample matrix due to increase of water contents. Thus, a new correction method using the combination between Compton scattered X-rays and the water contents was applied to overcome the soil moisture effect. Applying the proposed correction method, calibration curves of six metals with different water content gave identical inclinations of calibration curves. The analytical results of chromium in the geochemical reference sample were in good agreement with the standard value even with increased water content.},

	abstract = {For the purpose of deriving spatiotemporal estimates of soil moisture, the triangle method is one of the most widely used approaches today utilizing remote sensing data. Generally, those techniques are based on the physical relationships that exist when a satellite-derived land surface temperature (Ts) is plotted against a spectral vegetation index (VI). The present study proposes an improvement in the triangle method in retrieving soil moisture over heterogeneous areas. In particular, it proposes a new approach in robustly identifying the extreme points required for the technique's implementation. Those extreme points are then used in calculating fractional vegetation cover (Fr) and scaled Ts. Furthermore, the study proposes a new approach for calculating the coefficients required to develop the relationships between surface soil moisture (SSM) and Fr/Ts, which is implemented using a model and field data. As a case study, an agricultural field in the Varanasi district in India has been used, on which the triangle method is implemented using ECOSTRESS and Sentinel-2 data. The much-improved spatial resolution satellite data of similar to 70 m from ECOSTRESS allowed deriving more vivid results of SSM spatial variability for the study area. Comparisons between field soil moisture calculated using the proposed method returned an RMSE of 0.03 and R-2 value of 0.84, which are considered very satisfactory. The methodology proposed herein and the results obtained are of significant value with regards to the triangle method, contributing to ongoing efforts at present examining its use for operational product development at a global scale.},

This study presents a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) SMC retrieval model based on integrated multi-satellite data on the impact of the vegetation moisture content (VMC). The normalized microwave reflection index (NMRI) calculated with the multipath effect is mapped to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to estimate and eliminate the impact of VMC. A MARS model for retrieving the SMC from multi-satellite data is established based on the phase shift. To examine its reliability, the MARS model was compared with a multiple linear regression (MLR) model, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN) model, and a support vector regression (SVR) model in terms of the retrieval accuracy with time-series observation data collected at a typical station. The MARS model proposed in this study effectively retrieved the SMC, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.916 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.021 cm(3)/cm(3). The elimination of the vegetation impact led to 3.7\%, 13.9\%, 11.7\%, and 16.6\% increases in R-2 and 31.3\%, 79.7\%, 49.0\%, and 90.5\% decreases in the RMSE for the SMC retrieved by the MLR, BPNN, SVR, and MARS model, respectively.

Results showed that, compared with SBR and NPK, SR significantly increased available nitrogen by 7.4\% and 16.5\%, respectively, due to the higher ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitrogen, as well as the total carbon, available phosphorus, and slowly available potassium, suggesting that it could stock a sufficient nitrogen source. During the incubation period, the amount of N mineralization was relatively higher under SR than under SBR and NPK treatments, especially during the later mineralization time, whereas there was no difference in the N mineralization rate. In addition, SR significantly increased soil cumulative N mineralization and N mineralization potential. However, SBR significantly decreased the soil mineralizable N ratio compared with SR and NPK, which may result in a worsening of the N mineralization potential. The results indicated that long-term straw return combined with reducing chemical fertilizer application could significantly improve the N supply capacity of paddy rice field soil to better coordinate the soil N supply and immobilization.},

	abstract = {The slope-gully system, the erosion unit on the Loess Plateau, suffers from severe soil erosion and loss of soil nutrients. Restoring vegetation can effectively reduce soil erosion, thereby reducing the loss of nitrogen and phosphorus. In the Loess Plateau, owing to the shortage of water resources and the adverse effects of over-revegetation, the restoration of vegetation in large areas is limited. To efficiently prevent the loss of soil nu-trients and reduce non-point source pollution, vegetation patterns need to be reasonably restored. However, it is currently not clear as to how this can be achieved. Different slope-gully systems were established in this study, including pattern A (no vegetation), pattern B (up-slope vegetation), pattern C (middle-slope vegetation), and pattern D (down-slope vegetation). Then, the effects of vegetation patterns on soil total nitrogen (TN) and soil total phosphorus (TP) losses associated with runoff and sediment processes was quantitatively evaluated through the simulated rainfall. The results showed that (1) vegetation pattern markedly affected the yields of runoff, sediment, soil nitrogen, and soil phosphorus, resulting in the following order: pattern A {\textgreater} pattern B {\textgreater} pattern C {\textgreater} pattern D. (2) The correlation between TN and runoff was higher than that between TN and sediment; conversely, TP was more strongly correlated with sediment than with runoff. (3) Nitrogen loss with runoff was the main source of TN (58.76-90.74\%), while phosphorus loss with sediment was the main source of TP (48.51-89.30\%). Compared with other vegetation patterns, the down-slope can more effectively reduce the yields of runoff and sediment, thereby reducing the loss of TN and TP. Therefore, it was suggested that the lower part of the slope should be considered when revegetating.},

ST decreased soil inorganic N concentrations 16-40\% compared to FWT, with soil inorganic N higher in the tilled in-row zone compared to the undisturbed between-row zone in 1 of 3 years. The rye-vetch cover crop did not provide a consistent increase in soil inorganic N. ST increased soil leachate N concentrations by similar to 50\% and increased the potential for denitrification by 18\% but depressed sweet corn biomass and N contents in only one of three years, when hairy vetch biomass and soil moisture was lowest. We conclude that utilizing ST in combination with a cover crop is not likely to improve N use efficiency or crop yields, and may increase N losses within an organic cover crop-based cropping system.},

In this study, two pot experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of inoculations with the cyanobacterium Anabaena cylindrica on an arable Mollisol from the U.S. Upper Midwest and growth of spring wheat. Experiment 1 evaluated surface soil nutrient and microbial dynamics at early stages of wheat development. Experiment 2 evaluated the potential of microalgal inoculations (A. cylindrica and/or Chlamydomonas sp.) to replace urea and measured plant growth and soil parameters at three depths at harvest. Experiment 1 revealed inoculation increased surface soil soluble organic carbon (SolC), microbial biomass carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), mineral N, available phosphorus (P), and microbial activity. At day 42 after sowing, wheat plant N was higher in inoculated than non-inoculated soil, and the nitrate/nitrite level in inoculated soil significantly decreased in the presence of plants. In Experiment 2, inoculation had greater effects on surface soil than deeper soil depths for SolC, microbial biomass C and N, mineral N, and available-P. Grain yield was not statistically different in treatments with 100 \% N from urea, 75 \% N from A. cylindrica plus 25 \% N-urea, and 100 \% N from an algal mixture. Equivalent grain protein was achieved only when 25 \% N from urea was replaced with N from A. cylindrica, highlighting the need for optimizing inoculation timing and plant N uptake. These results support the beneficial role of cyanobacteria-based inoculations for soil quality and plant growth, and as renewable resources for agricultural systems.},

A field study was carried out in 2017-18 and 2018-19 at Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology, Bhubaneswar, India to investigate the integrated nutrient management strategies on productivity, nutrient indices and soil nutrient status in short grain aromatic rice-green gram cropping system. The experiment was set up in split plot design with six nutrient management strategies in rice were taken in main plot in randomized block design and three nutrient management strategies in green gram were taken as sub plot in split-plot design in sequence. Results revealed that application of 50\% NPK+ 50\% Recommended Dose of Nitrogen (RDN)-FYM to rice followed by 75\% NPK + Rhizobium + Phosphorus Solubilizing Bacteria to green gram recorded the highest rice equivalent yield and production efficiency in 2017-18 and 2018-19 followed by 50\% NPK+ 50\% RDN-FYM to rice followed by 100\% NPK to green gram. Application of 50\% NPK+ 50\% RDN-FYM to rice and 75\% NPK + Rhizobium + PSB to green gram recorded the highest partial factor productivity of nitrogen, nitrogen utilization efficiency and nitrogen uptake efficiency in the system. Soil nutrient status of the cropping system improved with balanced application of organic and inorganic sources of nutrients compared to mineral fertilizers only. Thus, supplementing FYM and sesbania as organic manures along with reduced dose of inorganic fertilizers improved sustainability of rice-green gram system along with improving soil fertility.},

A three-year (2013-2016) field trial was conducted during the rotation of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - maize (Zea mays L.) to investigate the effects of ridge-furrow mulching patterns on soil moisture, soil fertility, grain yield, and water use efficiency (WUE). Four ridge-furrow planting patterns included: (1) white plastic film mulch over the ridge (RW), (2) straw mulch over the furrow (RS), (3) white plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow (RWS), and (4) black plastic film mulch over the ridge and straw mulch over the furrow (RBS). Flat planting without mulch was CK. The results showed that RW, RS, RWS, and RBS significantly improved soil water storage and aboveground biomass throughout each winter wheat and summer maize growing season compared with CK. Finally, winter wheat grain yield and WUE in the four mulching treatments markedly increased by 13.0-32.9\% and 22.5-41.5\% in a wet and cool season, 15.5-35.2\% and 19.3-41.9\% in a season with normal rainfall and temperatures, and 27.2-58.9\% and 15.3-33.4\% in a dry and warm season, respectively. Maize grain yield and WUE increased by 12.8-35.0\% and 19.5-46.2\% in a season with normal rainfall and temperature, 15.0-38.5\% and 18.0-39.9\% in a dry and cool season, and 17.4-50.5\% and 13.0-42.5\% in a dry and warm season, respectively. Among the four mulching treatments, RWS and RBS significantly improved the yield and WUE of wheat and maize relative to RW and RS over the three years. After three years, soil total nitrogen content in RWS and RBS was significantly greater than in RS. Besides, soil microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen, and soil dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen contents in RWS and RBS were all markedly higher than in RW and RS. Our results indicated that RWS and RBS were a promising agricultural practice that improved crop production and simultaneously maintained soil fertility in a rain-fed semi-arid region of China.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to explore the effect of Chinese milk vetch (CMV) on soil fertility and rice production in double rice cropping systems. A field experiment was conducted including the following six treatments: Ck (no NPK mineral fertilizer and no CMV), CMV0 (NPK mineral fertilizer and no CMV), and CMV1-4 (NPK mineral fertilizer and 7500 kg ha(-1) CMV, 15,000 kg ha(-1) CMV, 22,500 kg ha(-1) CMV, 30,000 kg ha(-1) CMV) from 2008 to 2018. The results showed that the application of CMV enhanced the organic matter, the total nitrogen, the available phosphorus, pH, and enzyme activities (except for the cellulase) in paddy soils. The organic matter and total nitrogen of CMV3 were increased by 15.99\% and 8.07\% compared with CMV0 and the increase rate of the organic matter and total nitrogen was by an average of 0.413 and 0.029 g kg(-1) per year compared with the initial soil, respectively. The CMV return also improved the enzyme activities (except for the cellulase). Meanwhile, the CMV returned to soil increased dramatically the yields of early rice, late rice, and double rice by 13.46\%-26.23\%, 13.63\%-20.84\%, and 13.55\%-25.76\% compared with CMV0, respectively. The yields of early rice, late rice, and double rice of the CMV3 were highest among all the treatments. The application of CMV improved the agronomic efficiency (AE) and the partial factor productivity (PFP), especially for CMV3. The AE and PFP values of double rice for CMV3 increased by 64.54\% and 25.76\%, respectively. The application of CMV also increased the sustainability index and reduced the coefficient of variation of the rice yields. In addition, there was negative linear relationship between the amount of CMV needed to generate higher yields of double rice and the years of CMV application. In conclusion, CMV addition at 15,000-22,500 kg ha(-1) combined with mineral fertilizer had beneficial effects on the productivity, the stability of rice yield as well as the fertilizer efficiency in double rice cropping system.},

Among N sources, NS4 produced the highest maize grain yield (10 Mg.ha?(1)). Residual effects of N sources on mean rice grain yield were evident only in crop residue (NS2)- and vermicompost (NS4)-treated plots. After the harvest of two complete maize-rice crop cycles, higher content of dehydrogenase activity (DHA) and urease activity (UR) were observed in the soil under AT as compared to ZT and CT at 0-10 cm (p {\textless} 0.05). Similarly, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) also recorded positive changes at 0-10 cm soil depth, especially in NS2 and NS4 treatments. AT resulted in the highest total soil carbon (TOC) (8.10 g.kg(-1)), followed by CT (6.73 g.kg(-1)) and ZT (5.98 g.kg(-1)). Fertilizer N treatments, however, influenced the NO3-N accumulation beyond the root zone, where crop residue-based (NS2) fertilizer N treatment resulted in the highest NO3-N (32.52 kg.ha(-1)), and the lowest NO3-N (14.48 kg.ha(-1)) was observed in the FYM-based (NS3) treatment. Therefore, the practice of alternate tillage and integration of vermicompost (40 kg.N.ha(-1)) and chemical fertilizer (total 120 kg.ha(-1)) sources should be mostly recommended to farmers in the Terai region of India.},

Poplar-based AFS adopted in a big way by farmers in the Indo-Gangetic region of India has improved their economic status due to its high industrial value. The present study discusses the effect Populus deltoides as windbreak on yield of wheat as intercrop and soil nutrient status. We considered winter wheat varieties (WH-1105, WH-542, HD-2967, HD-943 and DPW-621-50) during two consecutive years (2013-15) delimited by a row of poplar trees in the east-west and north-south directions. Whereas effects on crop produce were limited for all wheat varieties with increasing distance from the tree line, considerable yield reductions were found near the tree line (treatments T-1 and T-2) for all the wheat varieties. The highest available soil N (365.2 kg ha(-1)), P (19.7 kg ha(-1)) and K (357.3 kg ha(-1)) were recorded near the tree line at a distance of 2 m. To optimize the provisioning service of poplar windbreak AFS, the cultivation of highly shade-tolerant wheat variety HD-2967 may be advisable over other varieties towards the end of the rotation of mature poplar trees.},

The present study investigates the different application techniques of a combined amendment (lime + zeolite + biochar + compost, LZBC) for soil Cd immobilization effect on growth performance, Cd uptake by the second season crops, and soil quality in greenhouse vegetable production (GVP) under a rotation system. Five fruit vegetables were cultivated as the second season crop in the same plots which have been used for pakchoi as the first season crop (with or without LZBC application). The results indicated that LZBC with the consecutive application (T3) promoted crops biomass and fruit yield the most, followed by LZBC with the second crop application (T2) and LZBC with the first crop application (T1). LZBC application showed increasing rhizosphere soil pH and improvement in soil fertility of all crops including available nitrogen, available phosphorus, available potassium, organic matter, and cation exchange capacity. LZBC had positive influences on soluble sugar, soluble protein, and vitamin C in edible parts of 5 vegetables. Cd contents in fruit, shoot, and root of eggplant, pimento, cowpea, and tomato except cucumber were reduced by adding LZBC. As for the economic performance, T3 had the highest output/input ratio in general. Overall, these results demonstrated that T3 was dramatically more effective for minimizing health risk, increasing production, and facilitating sustainable utilization of soil under the Cd-contaminated GVP system.},

We used numerical experiments to highlight the role of the `Brown Ocean' effect (where saturated soils function similar to a warm ocean surface) on intensification and it's modulation by land cover change. A numerical modeling experiment that successfully captured the flood event (control) was modified to alter moisture availability by converting wetlands to open water, wet croplands, and dry croplands. Storm evolution in the control experiment with wet antecedent soils most resembles tropical lows that form and intensify over oceans. Irrespective of soil moisture conditions, conversion of wetlands to croplands reduced storm intensity, and also, nonsaturated soils reduced rain by 20\% and caused shorter durations of high intensity wind conditions. Developing agricultural croplands and more so restoring wetlands and not converting them into open water can impede intensification of tropical systems that affect the area.},

	abstract = {Rapid and accurate measurement of high-resolution soil total nitrogen (TN) information can promote variable rate fertilization, protect the environment, and ensure crop yields. Many scholars focus on exploring the rapid TN detection methods and corresponding soil sensors based on spectral technology. However, soil spectra are easily disturbed by many factors, especially soil moisture and particle size. Real-time elimination of the interferences of these factors is necessary to improve the accuracy and efficiency of measuring TN concentration in farmlands. Although, many methods can be used to eliminate soil moisture and particle size effects on the estimation of soil parameters using continuum spectra. However, the discrete NIR spectral band data can be completely different in the band attribution with continuum spectra, that is, it does not have continuity in the sense of spectra. Thus, relevant elimination methods of soil moisture and particle size effects on continuum spectra do not apply to the discrete NIR spectral band data. To solve this problem, in this study, moisture absorption correction index (MACI) and particle size correction index (PSCI) methods were proposed to eliminate the interferences of soil moisture and particle size, respectively. Soil moisture interference was decreased by normalizing the original spectral band data into standard spectral band data, on the basis of the strong soil moisture absorption band at 1450 nm. For the PSCI method, characteristic bands of soil particle size were identified to be 1361 and 1870 nm firstly. Next, normalized index N-p, which calculated wavelengths of 1631 and 1870 nm, was proposed to eliminate soil particle size interference on discrete NIR spectral band data. Finally, a new coupled elimination method of soil moisture and particle size interferences on predicting TN concentration through discrete NIR spectral band data was proposed and evaluated. The six discrete spectral bands (1070, 1130, 1245, 1375, 1550, and 1680 nm) used in the on-the-go detector of TN concentration were selected to verify the new method. Field tests showed that the new coupled method had good effects on eliminating interferences of soil moisture and soil particle size.},

In the present study, to evaluate the cooling performance of a two-layer EAHE ventilating system, experimental work was conducted from May to August 2017. Because EAHE performance largely depends on the thermal characteristics of soil, an irrigation system was adopted to experimentally verify the effect of soil moisture content. Air temperature showed an average drop of 14.6 degrees C and the average total cooling capacity was 8792W. The system exhibited a maximum coefficient of performance (COP) of 27.2, implying that the system provides fresh-air cooling with little electricity input. Under cooling mode, the surrounding soil temperature increased continuously due to the operation of the system. An irrigation system was adopted to simulate natural precipitation; when the soil moisture changed from 0.37 cm(3)/cm(3) to 0.42 cm(3)/cm(3), air temperature decreased by 1.6 degrees C at the pipe outlet. The results show that using EAHE under wet conditions resulted in a large cooling capacity and COP, which indicates that a short pipe length or shallow depth is required for achieving a similar cooling capacity under wet soil conditions.

	abstract = {Root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an important variable in land-atmosphere interactions, notably affecting the global climate system. Contrary to satellite-based acquisition of surface soil moisture, RZSM is generally obtained from model-based simulations. In this study, in situ observations from the Naqu and Pali networks that represent different climatic conditions over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) and a triple collocation (TC) method are used to evaluate model-based RZSM products, including Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) (versions 3.5a and 3.5b), Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) (versions 2.1 and 2.2), and the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5). The evaluation results based on in situ observations indicate that all products tend to overestimate but could generally capture the temporal variation, and ERA5 exhibits the best performance with the highest R (0.875) and the lowest unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE; 0.015 m(3) m(-3)) against in situ observations in the Naqu network. In the TC analysis, similar results are obtained: ERA5 has the best performance with the highest TC-derived R (0.785) over the entire TP, followed by GLEAM v3.5a (0.746) and GLDAS-2.1 (0.682). Meanwhile, GLEAM v3.5a and GLDAS-2.1 outperform GLEAM v3.5b and GLDAS-2.2 over the entire TP, respectively. Besides, possible error causes in evaluating these RZSM products are summarized, and the effectiveness of TC method is also evaluated with two dense networks, finding that TC method is reliable since TC-derived R is close to ground-derived R, with only 6.85\% mean relative differences. These results using both in situ observations and TC method may provide a new perspective for the soil moisture product developers to further enhance the accuracy of model-based RZSM over the TP. Significance StatementThe purpose of this study is to better understand the quality and applicability of GLEAM, GLDAS, and ERA5 RZSM products over the TP using both in situ observations and the triple collocation (TC) method, making it better applied to climate and hydrological research. This study provides four standard statistical metrics evaluation based on in situ observations, as well as the reliable metric, that is, correlation coefficient (R) derived from TC method, and highlights that TC-based evaluation could supplement the ground-based validation, especially over the data-scarce TP region.},

	abstract = {Recently, the technology of combining vertical rotary sub-soiling (VRT) with ridge-furrow construction with plastic film mulching system (RFMS) has become a promising solution to improve soil water characteristics and crop yields in the semi-arid Loess Plateau, China. However, the effect of this technique on deep soil moisture and rainfall utilization to enhance the crop yield is unclear. To investigate this, two field experiments (2016-2017) were set up with maize and potato as research objects. There were four tillage practices under RFMS for maize: (1) MVT, VRT to a depth of 40 cm; (2) MST, sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm; (3) MTT, rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm; and (4) MZT, zero tillage. There were three tillage practices under RFMS for potato: (1) PVT, VRT to a depth of 40 cm; (2) PST, sub-soiling to a depth of 40 cm; and (3) PTT, rotary tillage to a depth of 15 cm. Our results showed that the VRT under RFMS mainly significantly reduced soil water storage (SWS) in the 0-100 cm profile at the flowering stage, and SWS in the 100-300 cm profile of maize and SWS in the 100-200 cm profile of potato at the harvest stage compared with other tillage practices. This increased evapotranspiration (ET) throughout the whole growth stage and indicated that VRT promoted the utilization of deep soil water (below 100 cm) for maize and potato. The increase of ET and utilization of deep soil water contributed to promote crop growth, directly improved chlorophyll content, accelerated dry matter accumulation and prolonged the duration of the maximum dry matter accumulation rate, resulting in higher water use efficiency (WUE), harvest index (HI) and yield. The results suggested that VRT under RFMS improved WUE by 3.5-14.6\%, HI by 2.8-23.85\% and yield by 12.1-47.4\% of maize compared to the other treatments and correspondingly by 18.9-92.3\%, 1.6-29.6\%, and 24.7-156.8\% for potato. In addition, VRT significantly improved fallow efficiency by 56.3-133.1\% and precipitation use efficiency (PUE) by 12.1-47.4\% for maize, and correspondingly by 101.9-272.7\% and 24.7-156.8\% for potato, compared with other treatments. These data indicated VRT can improve the efficiency of precipitation preservation and utilization in RFMS. Overall, VRT can efficiently utilize deep soil moisture and rainfall to promote crop growth under RFMS,thereby, significantly increased maize and potato yields.},

Therefore, it is of great significance to monitor surface soil moisture content (SMC) accurately for the study of the natural ecological environment. The Hapke model is the most widely used photometric model in soil remote sensing research, but the development of this model is limited by the lack of valid multi-angular data. The main innovations of this paper have two aspects: (1) A novel soil moisture retrieval approach based on the Hapke (SMR-Hapke) model is derived by exploring the relationship between single scattering albedo (SSA) and SMC on the optical bands from 400 to 2400 nm. The performance of the proposed model was verified on a dataset consisting of four different soil samples, and the experimental results indicated that the inverted soil moisture from SMR-Hapke model coincided with the measurement values, with theR(2)being generally more than 0.9 in the solar domain. (2) The SMR-Hapke model has been reduced to a linear form on the SWIR field and a physically-based normalized difference soil moisture indexNDSMIHapke has been proposed. Based on the laboratory-based hyperspectral data, we compared the performance ofNDSMIHapke with other traditional soil moisture indices using linear regression analysis, and the results demonstrate that the proposedNDSMIHapke had a great potential for estimating SMC withR(2)values of 0.88. Finally, high-resolution SMC map was produced by combining the Sentinel-2 MSI data withNDSMIHapke. This study provides a novel extended Hapke model for the estimation of surface soil moisture content.},

This study attempted to investigate the temporal-spatial variations of surface soil moisture, vegetation cover and their influencing factors of mountain-oasis-desert coupling system in Xinjiang from 1986 to 2015. The results showed that: (1) The surface soil moisture increased in most of the ecoregions of Xinjiang from 1986 to 2015 whereas the vegetation cover decreased in the same period. (2) The comparison of the correlations between soil moisture content (SMC) and the variables of precipitation and temperature revealed that precipitation is an important supplement source of SMC. The variation characteristics of surface soil moisture are closely related to the dry and wet soil conditions. (3) The comparison of the correlations between the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the variables of precipitation and temperature revealed that the different responses of vegetation to precipitation were related to the gradually decreased precipitation pattern in the mountain-oasis-desert system. Meanwhile, vegetation was found to be more sensitive to precipitation in deserts and oases and more sensitive to temperature in mountainous regions. In each ecoregion, the variation cycles of SMC and vegetation cover were slightly different, but it was found that SMC is more likely to be affected by temperature and precipitation rather than vegetation cover. Overall, surface soil moisture and vegetation cover products have a great potential to be effectively used in investigating landscape pattern variations, which is very important theoretically and practically for the mountain-desert-oasis system in arid areas.},

	abstract = {Livestock husbandry has raised enormous environmental concerns around the world, including water quality issues. Yet there is a need to document long-term water quality trends in livestock-intensive regions and reveal the drivers for the trends based on detailed catchment monitoring. Here, we assessed the concentration and load trends of dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) in streamwater of a livestock-intensive catchment in southwestern Norway, based on continuous flow measurements and flow-proportional composite water sampling. Precipitation and catchment-level soil P balance were monitored to examine the drivers. At the field level, moreover, the relationship between soil P balance and soil test P (measured using the ammonium lactate extraction method, PAL) was assessed. Results showed that on average of 20 years 95 \% of the P was applied to the catchment during March-August, when 40 \% of annual precipitation and 25 \% of annual discharge occurred. The low runoff helped reduce P loss following P applications. However, flow-weighted annual mean DRP concentration significantly increased with increasingly cumulative soil P surplus (R2 = 0.55, p = 0.0002). With a mean annual P surplus of 8.8 kg ha-1, the annual mean DRP concentration (range: 49-140 \& mu;g L-1; mean: 80 \& mu;g L-1) and annual DRP load (range: 0.35-1.46 kg ha-1; mean: 0.65 kg ha-1) significantly increased over the 20-year monitoring period (p = 0.001 and 0.0003, respectively). At the field level, P-AL concentrations were positively correlated with soil P balances (R2 = 0.48, p {\textless} 0.0001), confirming the long-term impact of P balances on the risks of P loss. The study highlights the predominant role of long-term P balances in affecting DRP loss in livestock-intensive regions through the effect on soil test P.},

We tested the introduction of faba beans in a tomato cropping system-both as preceding crop and in strip cropping (SC)-under different fertilization strategies-faba residues, animal manure, and vegetable compost. We studied: (i) the tomato nutrient uptake and yield and quality; (ii) the soil-N and P, the N-budget, and the mycorrhizal colonization. SC did not provide consistent positive effects on tomato production and quality, namely the N-uptake, N in the tomato yield, the mean fruit weight, and the sugar accumulation in berries, regardless of the type of fertilizers applied. SC improved the tomato dry yield and P-uptake, especially in years when the faba growth and the subsequent yield were problematic. Faba residues could provide sufficient N to sustain tomato production but care should be given in balancing additional N-inputs. Organic fertilization increased the soil-N concentration but did not always translate into an increased yield and a higher quality production, with the risk of escalating N-losses. SC improved the soil-P availability and mycorrhizal colonization in tomato, due to the rhizobia-mycorrhiza-mycorrhiza association, especially when coupled with organic fertilization. Finally, introducing faba as SC holds potential to improve the productive and environmental performance of organic tomato production.},

The aim of this paper is to examine the impact of salinity, texture and measurement frequency on dielectric permittivity - soil moisture calibration curves for ten soils of medium texture in the frequency range from 20 MHz to 3 GHz based on the complex dielectric permittivity spectra measured with the use of a coaxial transmission line cell connected to a vector-network-analyzer. The use of laboratory-measured spectra ensures that at all frequencies dielectric permittivity is measured at the same conditions with no influence of factors such as different sensitivity zone or various installation conditions, as in the case of comparing individual sensors operating at various frequencies. The obtained relations were comparable to the calibration curves of several capacitance/impedance sensors operating at corresponding frequencies. Calibration curves for apparent permittivity, which were obtained with the use of simulations in the time domain based on the measured spectra, were also determined for the tested soils. Even though the tested soils did not include soils with high clay content, the impact of soil texture on the calibration curves was observed. Results confirmed that the influence of soil salinity and texture on dielectric permittivity was the most significant in the lower part of the frequency spectrum, while the smallest impact of these factors was observed at frequencies of several hundred MHz and above.},

	abstract = {Long-term use of organic and inorganic fertilizers can have a negative impact on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient stoichiometry in paddy soil. However, production of sufficient crops to meet food and feed demands globally requires the use of fertilizer in crop production. In the present study, we assessed the environmental impacts of five fertilizer treatments in a rice-rice-fallow cropping system: no fertilizer (CK); inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers (NPK); manure (M); inorganic phosphorus and potassium fertilizers with manure (PKM); and inorganic nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers with manure (NPKM). Soil parameters were analyzed to examine the relationships between GHG emissions, net ecosystem carbon budgets (NECBs), and soil nutrient stoichiometric ratios. Both the PKM and NPKM treatments increased grain yield and the soil carbon-nitrogen (C:N), carbon-phosphorus (C:P), and nitrogen-phosphorus (N:P) ratios compared to the CK treatment; they also decreased the nitrogen-potassium (N:K) ratio. In the combined fertilization treatments, the fallow season accounted for 9-13\% of annual methane (CH4) emissions, whereas early rice accounted for 55-62 \% and late rice contributed 38-45 \%. Compared to the CK, PKM and NPKM fertilization increased the annual nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 52-73 \% and 103-115 \%, respectively, in both the rice and fallow seasons. In early rice, the C:P ratio and GHG intensity (GHGI) were negatively correlated with CH4 and N2O emissions, whereas both yield and CH4 emissions had strong positive associations with global warming potential (GWP). In the late rice season, GHGI was negatively correlated with carbon dioxide (CO2) and CH4 emissions, and N2O had strong positive associations with GWP. CO2 and N2O emission levels were greater from late rice than from early rice, although CH4 emissions from early rice contributed more to the annual GWP, resulting in higher carbon equivalent emissions but a lower carbon efficiency ratio in early rice output. A Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) optimization analysis suggested that PKM was the best fertilization method to improve yield while minimizing negative environmental impacts, followed in descending order by the NPKM, NPK, and M treatments.},

Controlling the amount of P fertilizer applied presents an inevitable choice for improving the PUE. Struvite recycled from agricultural wastewater rich in N and P concentrations are capable of slow nutrient release, improving nutrient uptake and enabling the reuse of nutrients from environmental sources when applied to agricultural land. A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of struvite combined with P reduction under a rice-wheat rotation system in eastern China. A total of five treatments were set up, including conventional fertilization (FP), a struvite substitution of 100\% P fertilizer (SP), a 50\% P reduction with struvite substitution (RSP), no application of N fertilizer (N0) and no application of P fertilizer (P0). Grain yield, crop N and P uptake, N and P use efficiency (NUE and PUE) and soil nutrient status were assessed. Under the same P application rate, the yield and aboveground biomass of the SP treatment were slightly higher than those of FP treatment, but the crop P uptake, PUE and soil available P content were significantly increased. The RSP treatment did not reduce yield with 50\% P reduction, and significantly improved the PUE and soil available P content. Crop N uptake and NUE were also found to be increased in SP and RSP treatments with struvite substitution. The P apparent balance showed that both the SP and FP treatments had a P surplus, but the RSP treatment had a P break-even, and the soil available P content remains stable compared with the initial value. The results indicate that struvite application could improve the soil P availability and crop nutrient uptake then promote the crop yield. To increase the nutrient use efficiency of crops while ensuring crop yield and soil fertility, appropriate P reduction combined with struvite as a P fertilizer could be sustainable in the rice-wheat rotation system in the long run.},

	abstract = {Surface mulching is an effective strategy to increase yields in rainfed agroecosystems. The plastic film residue and overuse of chemical fertilizer cause a serious non-point source pollution and high production input cost. With mulching, farmers typically attempt to maintain the balance of soil nutrients and reduce fertilizer use while ensuring high yields. Straw strip mulching (SM) is a new mulching technique, but the effects on nutrient uptake have not been studied yet. Therefore, 19 field comparative experiments were conducted in four growth seasons of winter wheat with three mulching treatments: (1) straw strip mulch (SM), a partial ground mulching using whole corn stalks that alternate with planting strips without mulch; (2) full-field plastic film mulching (PM); and (3) no mulching with wheat sown in rows, as a control (CK). Compared with CK, on average over all experiments, SM increased grain yield by 11.5\%, biomass by 19.0\%, the total aboveground uptakes of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) by 16.1\%, 18.4\% and 22.9\%. There were no significant differences between SM and CK in N and P requirements, the N, P and K concentrations in grain. The increased total aboveground uptake of each nutrient was closely associated with higher biomass, grain yield and straw yield (r = 0.66-0.84, P {\textless} 0.01). Relative to CK, SM significantly decreased the total accumulation of residual NO3-N in the top 100 cm at maturity stage by 32.3\% (22.7 kg ha(-1)) in typical fertilization (N, 120 kg ha(-1); P2O5, 90 kg ha(-1)) and by 33.8\% (45.8 kg ha(-1)) in high fertilization (N, 150 kg ha(-1); P2O5, 120 kg ha(-1)), and the leaching of NO3-N into the deep soil below 40 cm. When only grain nutrients exported from the field after harvest in typical fertilization, N balance in SM, PM and CK accounted for 43.8\%, 38.5\% and 48.6\% of N input, while P balance for 74.8\%, 74.0\% and 78.4\% of P input, respectively, indicating possible saving potentials in fertilizer costs for all treatment, but the saving potential of P is much greater than that of N. Relative to PM, SM had similar the total aboveground nutrients uptake, similar to or slightly less grain yields, and higher economic benefit. SM is suitable for popularizing in a semiarid rainfed agroecosystem.},

The results revealed that C. longa grown under tree spacing S1 coupled with the application of T3 treatment showed marked enhancement in growth, quality attributes of C. longa and post-harvest soil nutrient status whereas, yield attributes were better in S0. The yield of C. longa was curtailed by 22.5 and 31.6\%, whereas curcumin content was enhanced by 13.4\% and 12.2\% under S1 and S2, respectively over S0. The vegetation carbon density (66.38 Mg ha-1), total ecosystem carbon density (119.04 Mg ha-1), and total carbon sequestered (436.47 Mg ha-1) was found to be higher under S1, whereas soil carbon density (55.68 Mg ha-1) was maximum under S2 being at par with S1. Maximum net returns (14,693 US\$ ha-1 yr-1) were realised under S1 tree spacing and T3 treatment. Overall, the study concluded that in P. deltoids-C. longa system, application of 75\% RDN + 25\% FYM at 6 m x 4 m spacing of poplar have demonstrated efficacy in getting a better quality of turmeric, maintaining soil fertility, and combating climate change.},

	abstract = {The terrestrial carbon cycle is an important component of the global carbon budget due to its large gross exchange fluxes with the atmosphere and their sensitivity to climate change. Terrestrial biosphere models show large uncertainties in simulating carbon fluxes, which impact global carbon budget assessments. The land surface carbon cycle is tightly controlled by soil moisture through plant physiological processes. Accurate soil moisture observations thereby have the potential to improve the modeling of carbon fluxes in a model-data fusion framework. We employ the Carbon Cycle Data Assimilation System (CCDAS) to assimilate six years of surface soil moisture provided by the SMOS satellite in combination with global-scale observations of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. We find that assimilation of SMOS soil moisture exhibits better performance on soil hydrology modeling at both global and site-level than only assimilating atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and it improves the soil moisture simulation particularly in mid- to high-latitude regions where the plants suffer from water stress frequently. The optimized model also shows good agreements with inter-annual variability in simulated Net Primary Productivity (NEP) and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) from an atmospheric inversion (Jena CarboScope) and the up-scaled eddy covariance flux product (FLUXNET-MTE), respectively. Correlation between SIF (Solar Induced Fluorescence) and optimized GPP also shows to be the highest when soil moisture and atmospheric CO2 are simultaneously assimilated. In general, CCDAS obtains smaller annual mean NEP values (1.8 PgC/yr) than the atmospheric inversion and an ensemble of Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), but larger GPP values (167.8 PgC/yr) than the up-scaled eddy covariance dataset (FLUXNET-MTE) and the MODIS based GPP product for the years 2010 to 2015. This study demonstrates the high potential of constraining simulations of the terrestrial biosphere carbon cycle on inter-annual time scales using long-term microwave observations of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Long-range weather forecasts provide predictions of atmospheric, ocean and land surface conditions that can potentially be used in land surface and hydrological models to predict the water and energy status of the land surface or in crop growth models to predict yield for water resources or agricultural planning. However, the coarse spatial and temporal resolutions of available forecast products have hindered their widespread use in such modelling applications, which usually require high-resolution input data. In this study, we applied sub-seasonal (up to 4 months) and seasonal (7 months) weather forecasts from the latest European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in a land surface modelling approach using the Community Land Model version 5.0 (CLM5). Simulations were conducted for 2017-2020 forced with sub-seasonal and seasonal weather forecasts over two different domains with contrasting climate and cropping conditions: the German state of North Rhine-Westphalia (DE-NRW) and the Australian state of Victoria (AUS-VIC). We found that, after pre-processing of the forecast products (i.e. temporal downscaling of precipitation and incoming short-wave radiation), the simulations forced with seasonal and sub-seasonal forecasts were able to provide a model output that was very close to the reference simulation results forced by reanalysis data (the mean annual crop yield showed maximum differences of 0.28 and 0.36 t ha(-1) for AUS-VIC and DE-NRW respectively). Differences between seasonal and sub-seasonal experiments were insignificant. The forecast experiments were able to satisfactorily capture recorded inter-annual variations of crop yield. In addition, they also reproduced the generally higher inter-annual differences in crop yield across the AUS-VIC domain (approximately 50\% inter-annual differences in recorded yields and up to 17\% inter-annual differences in simulated yields) compared to the DE-NRW domain (approximately 15\% inter-annual differences in recorded yields and up to 5\% in simulated yields). The high- and low-yield seasons (2020 and 2018) among the 4 simulated years were clearly reproduced in the forecast simulation results. Furthermore, sub-seasonal and seasonal simulations reflected the early harvest in the drought year of 2018 in the DE-NRW domain. However, simulated inter-annual yield variability was lower in all simulations compared to the official statistics. While general soil moisture trends, such as the European drought in 2018, were captured by the seasonal experiments, we found systematic overestimations and underestimations in both the forecast and reference simulations compared to the Soil Moisture Active Passive Level-3 soil moisture product (SMAP L3) and the Soil Moisture Climate Change Initiative Combined dataset from the European Space Agency (ESA CCI). These observed biases of soil moisture and the low inter-annual differences in simulated crop yield indicate the need to improve the representation of these variables in CLM5 to increase the model sensitivity to drought stress and other crop stressors.},

The present study focused on the estimation of groundwater recharge using Soil Moisture Balance (SMB) and Baseflow Separation (BFS) methods in the Gilgel Gibe catchment where water demand for irrigation, domestic, and industrial purposes is dramatically increasing. The demand for groundwater and the existing ambitious plans to respond to this demand will put a strain on the groundwater resource in the catchment unless prompt intervention is undertaken to ensure its sustainability. Ground-based hydrometeorological 36-years data (1985 to 2020) from 17 stations and satellite products from CHIRPS and NASA/POWER were used for the SMB method. Six BFS methods were applied through the Web-based Hydrograph Analysis Tool (WHAT), SepHydro, BFLOW, and Automated Computer Programming (PART) to sub-catchments and the main catchment to estimate the groundwater recharge. The streamflow data (discharge) obtained from the Ministry of Water and Energy were the main input data for the BFS methods. The average annual recharge of groundwater was estimated to be 313 mm using SMB for the years 1985 to 2020 and 314 mm using BFS for the years 1986 to 2003. The results from the SMB method revealed geographical heterogeneity in annual groundwater recharge, varying from 209 to 442 mm. Significant spatial variation is also observed in the estimated annual groundwater recharge using the BFS methods, which varies from 181 to 411 mm for sub-catchments. Hydrogeological conditions of the catchment were observed, and the yielding capacity of existing wells was assessed to evaluate the validity of the results. The recharge values estimated using SMB and BFS methods are comparable and hydrologically reasonable. The findings remarkably provide insightful information for decision-makers to develop effective groundwater management strategies and to prioritize the sub-catchments for immediate intervention to ensure the sustainability of groundwater.},

A five-season (June 2013-October 2015) field experiment was conducted using N fertilizer rates of 0, 86, 172 and 258 kg ha(-1)during the summer maize growing season, and 0, 105, 210 and 315 kg ha(-1)during the winter wheat growing season. Soil NR increased sharply as N rates rose, but soil moisture storage decreased. Summer maize under the high N treatment suffered from increased NR levels and low soil water at the vegetative stage. The dry matter levels increased as the N supply rose during the wheat season. When the N application rate was below 210 and 172 kg N ha(-1)for wheat and maize, respectively, yield increased as the N application rose, but excessive N applications negatively affected maize and wheat grain yields. NUE decreased significantly as time progressed and N rates increased. The most appropriate N rates were 172 kg N ha(-1)for maize and 210 kg N ha(-1)for wheat, which led to relatively good soil moisture uptake and NR conditions.},

	abstract = {Rain gauges are unevenly spaced around the world with extremely low gauge density over developing countries. For instance, in some regions in Africa the gauge density is often less than one station per 10 000 km(2). The availability of rainfall data provided by gauges is also not always guaranteed in near real time or with a timeliness suited for agricultural and water resource management applications, as gauges are also subject to malfunctions and regulations imposed by national authorities. A potential alternative is satellite-based rainfall estimates, yet comparisons with in situ data suggest they are often not optimal. In this study, we developed a short-latency (i.e. 2-3 d) rainfall product derived from the combination of the Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) Early Run (IMERG-ER) with multiplesatellite soil-moisture-based rainfall products derived from ASCAT (Advanced Scatterometer), SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) and SMAP (Soil Moisture Active and Passive) L3 (Level 3) satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals. We tested the performance of this product over four regions characterized by high-quality ground-based rainfall datasets (India, the conterminous United States, Australia and Europe) and over data-scarce regions in Africa and South America by using triple-collocation (TC) analysis. We found that the integration of satellite SM observations with in situ rainfall observations is very beneficial with improvements of IMERG-ER up to 20\% and 40\% in terms of correlation and error, respectively, and a generalized enhancement in terms of categorical scores with the integrated product often outperforming reanalysis and ground-based long-latency datasets. We also found a relevant overestimation of the rainfall variability of GPM-based products (up to twice the reference value), which was significantly reduced after the integration with satellite soil-moisture-based rainfall estimates. Given the importance of a reliable and readily available rainfall product for water resource management and agricultural applications over data-scarce regions, the developed product can provide a valuable and unique source of rainfall information for these regions.},

The importance of inherent soil fertility is often ignored owing to the complexity of the relationship between crop productivity and soil properties in the field with continuous fertilization. Here, our goal was to improve the understanding of long-term crop responses to soil nutrient availability. This study was one component of long-term nutrient management experiments conducted from 1993 to 2018. Field receiving standard fertilization before 2007 was divided into fertilized and non-fertilized plots. Fertilizer application was suspended in non-fertilized treatment since 2007 for 11 years, but control treatment continuously received standard fertilization (252-164-281 kg ha(-1) year(-1) of N-P-K) from 1993 to 2018. Crop biomass and N uptake decreased by 29-69\% and 28-76\% of standard fertilization in wheat and maize, respectively from 2008 to 2011, and then stabilized at 10-41\% and 31-73\% of standard fertilization in wheat and maize, respectively, from 2012 to 2018. Spatial analysis of crop growth and soil characteristics showed that grain yields of both species after cessation of fertilization were associated with total and available soil N (r = 0.62-0.79). The large within-field yield variation (42-52\%) after 3 years of suspended fertilization resulted from a slight (9\%) variation in soil N availability. Cessation of fertilizer affected vegetative growth of wheat and reproductive growth of maize and both species showed different determinants of the yield formation processes under low soil fertility.},

However, the best cropping systems have not been selected yet though field research. Experiments were conducted for two years with an objective of establishing sustained finger millet based short term cropping sequence in two major finger millet producing areas of Ethiopia. The experiments were laid out in a split-plot arrangement with six precursor crops (haricot bean, maize, sweet lupine, niger seed, wheat, and teff) as a main plot factor, where determined residues were retained in the main plot after harvesting and two nitrogen fertilizer levels (30 and 60 kg ha(-1)) applied for finger millet as sub-plots with three replications. Soil analysis result examined immediately after finger millet harvest showed a significant effect of precursor crops and nitrogen fertilizer rates on soil properties. Planting finger millet following lupine increased the soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity by 17.37\%, 65.50\%, 26.15\%, respectively, over planting finger millet following teff. Use of different amount of nitrogen fertilizer likely contributed to observed differences in residual soil nutrients. Accordingly, finger millet following lupine with the addition of 60 kg ha(-1) nitrogen fertilizer gave significantly higher finger millet grain yield (3.24 tone ha(-1)) and relative production (22.37\%) and economic (40.7\%) efficiency. This system with their high sustainability and multiple benefits can be readily accepted by the farming community.},

Irrigation using nanobubbles (NBs) has been an efficient method to increase crop yield and WUE by ameliorating hypoxic conditions and promoting plant growth. However, the potential effects and mechanisms of different oxygen concentrations in water enriched in nanobubbles (NBW) remain unclear. Herein, this study examined the influence of different total oxygen concentrations (TOCs, ranged between 160 and 280 mg L-1) on tomato agronomic performance, soil fertility, and the bacterial community after a two-season of NBW irrigation. The results indicated that the tomato yield, WUE, soluble sugar, and vitamin C were significantly improved by NBs, showing the trends of rising to decrease with the corresponding oxygen concentration in irrigation water. The total C (TC), organic matter (OM), available N (AN) and K (AK) in soil tended to increase and then decrease with TOC in irrigation water. NB220 obtained the highest soil OM and AN values, and NB250 obtained the highest TC and AK values. The soil bacterial community composition gradually differentiated with increasing oxygen concentration. There were significant differences in relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae across the six oxygen levels. The keystones in the co-occurrence network were dependent on oxygen levels. FAPROTAX results revealed that bacterial functions of methanol oxidation, N fixation, aerobic chemoheterotrophy, and cellulolysis were more abundant in NB220 treated soils, consequently resulting in better crop yield, WUE, and soil fertility. Overall, the increased abundance of taxa participating in soil nutrient turnover contributed to improved soil fertility and crop agronomic performance. Our findings provided a significant opportunity to advance the understanding of oxygen threshold during aerated irrigation, with implications for green and efficient agricultural production.},

	abstract = {Long-term, high-resolution soil moisture (SM) is a vital variable for understanding the water-energy cycle and the impacts of climate change on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). However, most existing satellite SM data are only available at coarse scale (+/- 25 km) and suffer a lot from data gaps due to satellite orbit coverage and snow cover, especially on the QTP. Although substantial efforts have been devoted to downscale SM utilizing multiple soil moisture indices (SMIs) or diverse machine learning (ML) methods, the potentials of different SMIs and ML approaches in SM downscaling on the complex plateau remain unclear, and there is still a necessity to obtain an accurate, long-term, high-resolution and seamless SM data over the QTP. To address this issue, this study generated the long-term, high-accuracy and seamless soil moisture dataset (LHS-SM) over the QTP during 2001-2020 using a two-step downscaling method (first downscaling then merging). Firstly, the daily SM data from the Climate Change Initiative program of the European Space Agency (ESA CCI) was downscaled to 1 km utilizing five ML approaches. Then, a dynamic data merging method that considers spatiotemporal nonstationary error was applied to derive the final LHS-SM data. The performance of fifteen SMIs was also assessed and the optimal indexes for downscaling were identified. Results indicated that the shortwave infrared band-based indices had better performance than the near infrared band-based and energy-based indices. The generated LHS-SM data exhibited satisfying accuracy (mean R = 0.52, ubRMSE = 0.047 m(3)/m(3)) and certain improvement to the ESA CCI SM data both at station and network scales. Compared with existing 1 km SM datasets, the LHS-SM data also showed the best performance (mean R = 0.62, ubRMSE = 0.047 m(3)/m(3)), while existing datasets either failed to fully characterize the spatial details or had some data gaps and unreasonable distributions. Strong spatial heterogeneity was observed in the SM dynamics during 2001-2020 with the southwest and northeast showing a “dry gets wetter” scheme and the southeast presenting a “wet gets drier” trend. Overall, the LHS-SM dataset gained its added values by compensating the drawbacks of existing 1 km SM products over the QTP and was much valuable for many regional applications.},

The experiment involved two irrigation methods: drip (D) and flood (M) irrigation. Three irrigation levels included rain-fed without irrigation (W0), and 50\% (W1) and 80\% (W2) of field capacity (Fc). Three fertilizer treatments included no additional fertilizer application (F0), 375 kg center dot hm-2 (F1), and 750 kg center dot hm-2 (F2), in addition to a control (CK) without irrigation or fertilization. The soil water content (SWC) decreased after the crop replacement. Additionally, nitrate nitrogen (NN), ammonium nitrogen (AN), and organic matter (OM) content levels in all treatments increased, whereas total phosphorus (TP) content decreased. The soil layer with crop roots moved downward after crop replacement, and partial fertilizer productivity (PFP), irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), and water use efficiency (WUE) were decreased under both irrigation treatments. Principal component analysis showed that the W2F2 treatment had the highest benefit from crop combination across both irrigation treatments during the crop replacement period. According to our results, to optimize the benefits of apple-crop intercropping, drip irrigation with complete water supply and flood irrigation with incomplete water supply are recommended during crop replacement. In addition, an upper irrigation limit of 80\% Fc with 750 kg center dot hm-2 fertilization is recommended for optimal water and fertilizer regulation.},

Effective irrigation is possible with regular monitoring of soil and plant water conditions and with the forecasting of future crop water requirement. This study explored the capability of indices for estimating soil moisture as an indicator of detection irrigation time in sugarcane farms located in the southwest of Iran. For this goal, Landsat 8 satellite images were got from May until September 2015. Concurrent with the satellite pass times, field measurements include soil moisture (SM) and canopy temperature was done at the predefined points in sugarcane farms. These farms were selected with different age and irrigation days. Various indices were calculated using the combination of optical and thermal infrared wavelengths, and their relationship to the amount of SM was studied. According to the results of this research, vegetation indices based on optical bands do not show a good coefficient of determination (R-2). Results showed that soil moisture computed by crop water stress index (CWSI) and temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI) have a similar trend, which showed that both indices can be used for irrigation scheduling, although they had some differences for computed soil moisture, TVDI had better correlation than to CWSI. TVDI indicated a good correlation with SM measurement data whichR(2)values range from 0.35 to 0.66, as well as inharmonious with the spatial distribution of (SM). It showed (RMSE) less than 0.2. Comparing recorded irrigation and (SM) in the farms shows that (SM) can be classified into three classes: low soil moisture (0.1 {\textless} SM {\textless}= 0.15), medium soil moisture (0.15 {\textless} SM {\textless}= 0.2) and high soil moisture (0.2 {\textless} SM {\textless}= 0.25). This classification can be utilized for precision irrigation scheduling in soils with heavy and semi-heavy texture (silty clay and silty clay loam). All of the results demonstrated that the TVDI can be utilized for assessment SM and determine irrigation time in agriculture lands, without each other in situ measurement of data.},

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the temporal and spatial variation of soil P in pomelo orchards and future to predict P pool from 1985 to 2100, based on the dynamic P pool simulator (DPPS) model. We found that an average of 282.23 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) accumulated in pomelo orchard soil, resulting in increased concentration of Olsen P (i.e., 5-212 mg kg(-1)) and total P (i.e., 80-1883 mg kg(-1)) in the topsoil. It showed that Olsen P and total P pools increased in topsoil about 42 and 25 folds, respectively from 1985 to 2015. Soil P accumulation occurred not only in topsoil but also found in deeper soil horizon of pomelo orchard. Compared with the natural forest, the concentration of Olsen P and fractions (Al-P and Fe-P) in 20-year-old pomelo orchard increased significantly in soil depth of 0-120 cm, while Sol-P increased significantly in 0-60 cm soil depth. Scenario analyses from 1985 to 2100 indicated that the P application rate at 31 kg P ha(-1) could maintain pomelo yield at its optimum level. These findings could provide the synthesized novel insight for understanding the soil P status and its sustainable management in the pomelo orchard systems.},

Substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer can alleviate the problem, although the long-term effect of organic manure incorporation is unknown. We conceptualized that substituting organic manure for chemical fertilizer may result in higher crop yields and PUE. Therefore, the impact of long-term fertilizer treatments: (i) CK (control), (ii) PK (phosphorus and potassium fertilizer), (iii) NP (nitrogen and P fertilizer), (iv) NK fertilizer, (v) NPK fertilizer, and (vi) NPKM (30\% NPK fertilizer plus 70\% manure) on rice yield, PUE, P uptake, and apparent balance (APB) was investigated. The results showed that rice yield under different fertilizer treatments ranged from 6.2 to 11.8 t ha(-1) (1984-1995), 7.9 to 12.7 t ha(-1) (1996-2007), and 6.6 to 12.8 t ha(-1) (2008-2018). The rice yield under NPKM was greatly improved compared to other treatments, except with that of NPK (1984-1995). Soil organic carbon (SOC), available P and phosphorus activation coefficient (PAC) under NPKM were significantly higher than other treatments during 1984-2018. Soil pH (1984-2018) was greatly higher under CK and NPKM than under other treatments. Soil total P under PK, NP, NPK, and NPKM was significantly higher than under CK and NK (1984-2018). Compared to other treatments, P uptake was significantly higher under NPKM, except with that of NPK (1984-1995 and 2008-2018). The average PUE (1984-2018) was 10.7, 20.2, 36.1, and 44.2 kg kg(-1) under PK, NP, NPK, and NPKM, respectively. The APB under NPKM was significantly lower as compared to PK, NP, and NPK treatments. Therefore, we conclude that in addition to improving soil organic carbon, cations inputs from organic manure can be a factor for the increase in soil pH, making organic manure substitution for chemical fertilizer a more efficient strategy for increasing PUE and crop yield.},

The economic N application rate that simultaneously improved rice yield and N use efficiency in the rotation system was also investigated. Results demonstrated that soil residues and mineralized N accounted for more than 58.0\% and 53.2\% of the total N input in the early and late rice seasons, respectively. Similarly, most of the total N input was absorbed by rice, ranging from 43.7\% to 55.6\% in early rice and from 36.8\% to 54.7\% in late rice. Rice N use efficiency significantly decreased with increasing N application, while rice grain yield and its N uptake increased when the N application rate was below 150 kg ha(-1) in early rice and 200 kg ha(-1) in late rice. Exceeding this point limited rice N uptake and yield formation. The apparent N recovery rate, N residual rate, and N loss rate were 23.5-34.4\%, 17.0-47.1\%, and 26.0-47.8\% for the early rice, and 32.8-37.3\%, 74.2-87.0\%, and 71.5-92.1\% for the late rice. The linear plateau analysis further indicated that the recommended N application rate (118.5-152.8 kg ha(-1) for early rice and 169.9-186.2 kg ha(-1) for late rice) can not only maintain a relatively higher rice yield and N utilization but also significantly reduce soil N residue.

Therefore, the present field experiment was conducted to evaluate the impact of different planting pattern arrangements on the spatial distribution of soil total nitrogen and organic matter content under a maize/soybean strip relay intercropping system. The planting was arranged in a manner such that soil sampling could be done from continuous maize/soybean relay strip intercropping (MS1), maize/soybean relay strip intercropping in rotation (MS2), traditional maize/soybean intercropping (MS3), sole maize (M), sole soybean (S), and fallow land (FL) from 2018 to 2020. The results showed significant variations for soil organic matter and total nitrogen content under different planting pattern arrangements of maize and soybean in the strip relay intercropping system. Across all systems, the highest soil organic matter (29.19 g/kg) and total nitrogen (10.19 g/kg) were recorded in MS2. In contrast, the lowest soil organic matter (1.69 g/kg) and total nitrogen (0.64 g/kg) were observed in FL. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when compared with FL. Soil organic matter and total nitrogen in MS2 increased by 186.45\% and 164.06\%, respectively, when compared with FL. Furthermore, under MS2, the spatial distribution of soil organic matter was higher in both maize and soybean crop rows as compared with other cropping patterns, whereas the soil total nitrogen was higher under soybean rows as compared with maize in all other treatment. However, correlation analysis of the treatments showed variations in organic matter content. It can be concluded that different planting patterns can have varying effects on soil organic matter and total nitrogen distribution under the strip relay intercropping system. Moreover, it is recommended from this study that MS2 is a better planting pattern for the strip relay intercropping system, which can increase the spatial distribution of soil organic matter and total nitrogen, thereby improving soil fertility, C:N ratio, and crop production. This study will serve as a foundation towards the scientific usage of chemical fertilizers in agricultural sector.},

	abstract = {Microbial diversities in the vicinity of root rhizosphere play a crucial role in promoting plant and soil ecosystem health and productivity. They have great potential as key indicators of soil health in agro-ecosystems enhancing the availability of nutrients. Therefore, a study was carried out during 2019-20 and 2020-21 at research farm of Chaudhary Charan Singh Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, Haryana to investigate the rhizospheric microbial diversities under cotton (Gossypium spp.)-wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cropping system as affected by land configuration and nutrient management. Experiment consisted of 5 nutrient treatments replicated thrice and two land configurations, viz. raised bed (RB) and flatbed (FB) planned in factorial randomized block design (RBD). The results of experiment under RB revealed that farmyard manure (FYM) and FYM with biofertilizer and cow urine formulation (FYM + Org) showed the highest bacterial, fungal, phosphate solubilizing bacteria, azotobacter and actinomycetes population (6.92 to 7.51, 24.63 to 26.80, 7.61 to 7.68, 8.74 to 9.15,7.27 to 7.66 cfu/g soil, respectively). The decrease in microbial diversity was observed under inorganic fertilizer application through soil test crop response approach with targeted yield of 5.5 and 2.8 mg/ha (STCR5.5/2.8) and 6.0 and 3.2 mg/ha (STCR6.0/3.2) and control for cotton and wheat, respectively. Higher microbial population and soil organic carbon was found in RB compared to FB. The STCR5.5/2.8 and STCR6.0/3.2 recorded highest cotton and wheat yield followed by FYM and FYM+Org and least in control under cotton-wheat system. Thus, the study suggests that RB planting with an addition of manures along with biofertilizer and cow urine formulation could be a sustainable and feasible practice through enhanced microbial population raising soil fertility leading to increase the crop yields under semi-arid regions.},

Most experiments have been conducted with AMF inoculation under potted conditions, while field inoculation of AMF on citrus, especially a high economic hybrid tangor variety Beni-Madonna (Citrus nanko x C. amakusa), has been rarely recorded. This study aimed to analyze the effects of two AMF inoculations (a single Funneliformis mosseae and a mixture of F. mosseae, Diversispora versiformis, and Rhizophagus intraradices) on the internal and external fruit quality, leaf antioxidant defense system, and soil fertility and structure of top-worked Beni-Madonna tangor citrus trees. Three and a half years after AMF inoculations, soil hyphal length and root mycorrhizal colonization rate increased by 61.2-101.8\% and 15.85-29.6\% in inoculated plants, respectively. Inoculated trees had higher external fruit coloration value, fruit horizontal diameter, and fruit weight, and lower fruit rigidity than uninoculated trees. AMF-inoculated trees had higher glucose levels of fruit peels, fructose and sucrose levels of fruit fleshes, and the ratio of fruit soluble solids/titratable acids, as well as lower titratable acids concentrations than non-AMF-inoculated trees. AMF inoculation significantly increased leaf nitrogen balance index, chlorophyll index, peroxidase, catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione reductase activities, as well as reduced glutathione and oxidized glutathione concentrations, resulting in lower hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde levels when compared to the uninoculated treatment. In addition, inoculated trees presented higher soil nutrient levels, including organic carbon, available K, and Olsen-P as, well as soil aggregate stability (based on mean weight diameter) than uninoculated trees. This study concluded that field AMF inoculation improved fruit quality, enhanced leaf antioxidant defense system, and improved soil fertility of Beni-Madonna trees, with mixed AMF being prominent in improving fruit quality and F. mosseae being prominent in enhancing leaf antioxidant defense system and improving soil fertility.},

Since July 2020, high revisit time, high-resolution acquisitions by the Satelite Argentino de Observacion COn Microondas (SAOCOM) Argentinian-Italian constellation have become accessible over Europe. Therefore, this research presents an investigation of the potential of multi-temporal L-band SAOCOM-1 for monitoring soil moisture variations underneath low and sparse agricultural vegetation. Moreover, it proposes a procedure for the mitigation of roughness contribution, by exploiting the entropy parameter derived from the dual-polarimetric decomposition. L-band sensitivity to soil moisture has been jointly evaluated in respect of Sentinel-1 C-band data by (1) comparing the temporal profiles of the backscattering coefficient, gamma(0), at VV and VH polarization, with the support of decomposition parameters (entropy and alpha), NDVI and precipitation data; (2) regression analysis with in situ soil moisture measurements, obtained by the REMEDHUS network in the Douro River basin (Spain); 3) evaluating the soil moisture retrievals obtained at C- and L- band using a change detection method. Finally, the effectiveness of the roughness normalization procedure for SAOCOM data has been validated using in situ data. L-band co-polarized gamma(0) has proved to be the best configuration for soil moisture inversion, being relatively insensitive to vegetation, as demonstrated by decomposition results and trend interpretation. Overall, regressions detected an R-2 22\% higher at L-band than C-band, with values up to 0.74 for VV ((R) over bar (2)=0.32) and up to 0.47 for the VH band ((R) over bar (2)=0.14). Co-polarized data obtained R-2 on average 62.1\% and 74.7\% higher for SAOCOM and Sentinel-1. The retrieval models show an ubRMSD of 7.1\% for SAOCOM data and 8.3\% for Sentinel-1. The application of the proposed roughness normalization procedure to SAOCOM led to an ubRMSD of 6.7\% improving the retrieved soil moisture trend by 7.9\%. This exploratory analysis demonstrated SAOCOM data potential for soil moisture mapping and would serve as a foundation for more advanced retrieval procedures.},

	abstract = {Most current optical/thermal-based surface soil moisture (SSM) retrieval methods only utilize the instantaneous measurements made by onboard polar-orbit satellites, and they require soil texture as prior knowledge to obtain the volumetric SSM content. A recent study developed a diurnal land surface temperature (LST)-based SSM retrieval method to directly estimate the volumetric SSM content without the knowledge of soil texture. However, most subsequent studies have only examined the use of this method on bare soils. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the feasibility of the method over vegetated regions with both experimental data and satellite observations. First, the impacts of vegetation on SSM retrieval were investigated through physics-based Common Land Model simulations and high accuracy with an overall root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.010 m(3)m(-3) was achieved when the underlying surface was covered by moderate fractional vegetation cover from 0 to 0.6 with a given soil texture. Based on the simulated results, the SSM was then estimated using data from an AmeriFlux site dominated by crops during the growing season in 2018; the results were further verified using in situ measurements, and this showed that the estimated SSM correlated well with in-situ measurements (with an RMSE of 0.078 m(3)m(-3)). A further evaluation of the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)-derived SSM at the pixel scale was made using the proposed method, and the results revealed an overall acceptable accuracy (RMSE of 0.074 m(3)m(-3) and bias of 0.071 m(3)m(-3)) against the SMAP/Sentinel-1 SSM product at the same spatial resolution of 3 km.},

An effective drought monitoring and early warning system is thus critical to support risk mitigation and management by countries in the region. Here we investigate the potential for assimilation of leaf area index (LAI) and soil moisture observations to improve the representation of the overall hydrological and carbon cycles and drought by an advanced land surface model. The results reveal that assimilating soil moisture does not meaningfully improve model representation of the hydrological and biospheric processes for this region, but instead it degrades the simulation of the interannual variation in evapotranspiration (ET) and carbon fluxes, mainly due to model weaknesses in representing prognostic phenology. However, assimilating LAI leads to greater improvement, especially for transpiration and carbon fluxes, by constraining the timing of simulated vegetation growth response to evolving climate conditions. LAI assimilation also helps to correct for the erroneous interaction between the prognostic phenology and irrigation during summertime, effectively reducing a large positive bias in ET and carbon fluxes. Independently assimilating LAI or soil moisture alters the categorization of drought, with the differences being greater for more severe drought categories. We highlight the vegetation representation in response to changing land use and hydroclimate as one of the key processes to be captured for building a successful drought early warning system for the MENA region.},

	abstract = {Soil erosion can affect the nature and distribution of soil carbon and nutrients, directly and indirectly influencing microbially facilitated processes of mineralization, ammoniation, and nitrification, thus affecting soil nutrients cycling. However, little is known about how soil erosion affects soil microorganisms. Since 2012, we conducted a modified soil erosion simulation experiment of topsoil removal method in an agricultural field to simulate erosion depths of 5, 10, 20, 30, and 40 cm versus a control (0 cm). The results showed that Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were the dominant soil microbial (here: Bacteria and Archaea) phyla, and Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter, and Actinospica were the dominant genera in all samples. The relative abundance of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Planctomycetes, Thaumarchaeota, Acidothermus, Candidatus Solibacter, Acidibacter, Bryobacter, Actinospica, and Rhodanobacter decreased with the increase of erosion depths, while Chloroflexi and Firmicutes increased with the increase of erosion depths. Soil microbial community structure was altered significantly at 30- and 40-cm soil erosion depth in comparison to control. Soil nutrient variability caused by soil erosion had a greater impact on soil microbial community composition than that of soil mechanical composition. Soil erosion indirectly affected microbial community composition through negative effects on soil available potassium, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and sand content. We thus highlight the importance of soil nutrients monitoring in different soil erosion levels to make the proper ecological restoration strategies to improve soil environment which soil microorganisms depend on.},

Therefore, the dynamic adjustments in fertilizer-N application with RS incorporation that impacts crop productivity, N availability, N use efficiency (NUE) and soil enzymatic activity are required. We investigated the long-term impacts of four rates of RS incorporation (0, 5.0, 7.5 and 10.0 Mg ha(-1) year(-1); RS0, RS5.0, RS7.5 and RS10.0) and four rates of fertilizer-N (0, 90, 120 and 150 kg N ha(-1); N-0, N-90, N-120 and N-150) application in different combinations on N dynamics in soils, enzyme activity, crop yields and NUE. Results revealed that fertilizer-N application significantly (p{\textless}0.05) increased the grain yield, NUE and soil N pools in response to increasing RS incorporation rates. Fertilizer-N application combined with RS rates (RS5.0-RS7.5) resulted in a significantly higher mineral-N (NH4+-N + NO3–N) concentration compared with no-straw and no-N application (N-0 RS0), which decreased with increased soil depth. The combined application of fertilizer-N and RS incorporation significantly increased soils' enzymatic activity (urease and L-asparaginase) and glomalin related soil protein (TG). The crop (rice and wheat) yields (grain and straw) were significantly higher with fertilizer-N application of 120 kg N ha(-1) along with RS incorporation of 7.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) (N-120 RS7.5). The physiological efficiency of N (PEN) was significantly improved with fertilizer-N application and RS incorporation from 35.6 to 73.2 kg N kg(-1) in rice and 35.7-64.9 kg N kg(-1) in wheat. The reciprocal internal use efficiency of N (RIUEN) ranged from 14.8 to 19.5 kg Mg(-1)in rice and from 17.5 to 21.5 kg Mg-1 in wheat. Average net returns and the benefit-cost ratio for rice and wheat were significantly increased with N-120 RS7.5, compared with N-90 RS7.5 treatment. The higher rate of fertilizer-N application at similar RS incorporation rate (N-150 RS7.5) did not result in significant change in crop yields and economic indices, compared with N-120 RS7.5. Therefore, application of 120 kg N ha(-1) is the optimum rate with RS incorporation at 7.5 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) for increased productivity, NUE and economic returns, while avoiding environmental implications associated to open field straw burning in north-western India.},

We then analyzed soil chemistry, the diversity of soil bacteria and fungi, and the composition of metabolites to clarify the mechanism underlying the effects of this intercropping system on soil properties. Results and discussionSoil chemistry analyses revealed that the content of several soil nutrients such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) was higher in the BAS process than in the CK. In the DIS process, a large amount of soil P was consumed by DI. At the same time, the urease activity was inhibited, thus slowing down the loss of soil in the DI process, while the activity of other enzymes such as beta-glucosidase and laccase was increased. It was also noticed that the content of lanthanum and calcium was higher in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and DI did not significantly alter the concentrations of these soil metal ions. Bacterial diversity was higher in the BAS process than in the other treatments, and fungal diversity was lower in the DIS process than in the other treatments. The soil metabolome analysis revealed that the abundance of carbohydrate metabolites was significantly lower in the BAS process than in the CK and the DIS process. The abundance of D(+)-talose was correlated with the content of soil nutrients. Path analysis revealed that the content of soil nutrients in the DIS process was mainly affected by fungi, bacteria, the soil metabolome, and soil enzyme activity. Our findings indicate that the sugarcane-DIS intercropping system can enhance soil health.},

	abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) availability is one of the limiting factors of crop productivity, and it is strongly influenced by global change and agricultural management practices. However, very few studies have assessed how the winter drought affected soil N availability during the subsequent growing season under chemical fertilization. We conducted a field investigation involving snow removal to simulate winter drought conditions in a Mollisol cropland in Northeast China as part of a 6-year fertilization experiment, and we examined soil physicochemical properties, microbial characteristics, and N availability. Our results demonstrated that chemical fertilization significantly increased soil ammonium and total N availability by 42.9 and 90.3\%, respectively; a combined winter drought and fertilization treatment exhibited the highest soil N availability at the end of the growing season. As the growing season continued, the variation in soil N availability was explained more by fertilization than by winter drought. The Mantel test further indicated that soil Olsen-P content and microbial carbon use efficiency (CUE) were significantly related to soil ammonium availability. A microbial community structure explained the largest fraction of the variation in soil nitrate availability. Microbial CUE showed the strongest correlation with soil N availability, followed by soil available C:P and bacteria:fungi ratios under winter drought and chemical fertilization conditions. Overall, we clarified that, despite the weak effect of the winter drought on soil N availability, it cannot be ignored. Our study also identified the important role of soil microorganisms in soil N transformations, even in seasonally snow-covered northern croplands.},

Peanuts area particularly valuable crop in tropical and subtropical regions. While the demand for peanuts is increasing globally, there is a significant gap in nitrogen supply and demand in peanut production systems. To alleviate this, nitrogen fertilizers are often applied indiscriminately; this practice leads to the deterioration of indigenous soil fertility and to a long-term decline in crop productivity. Considering these aspects of soil health, a field study was conducted over two consecutive winter (November-March) seasons in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017 at the research farm of the agricultural university Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya in West Bengal, India. This study examined supplementing different levels of nitrogen fertilizer with rhizobium and soil mulch in an irrigated peanut crop. The effects of these management interventions were evaluated in terms of crop productivity, nutrient dynamics, soil moisture, and the soil microbial activity. Peanuts grown with the 100\% recommended dose of nitrogen, which was applied with rhizobium and grown under polythene mulching, recorded the highest average pod yield (3.87 and 3.96 t ha(-1) in 2015-2016 and 2016-2017) and average kernel yield (2.88 and 2.99 t ha(-1)) in both growing seasons. This treatment also resulted in the greatest accumulation of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium by the peanut plants. In contrast, the maximum soil moisture distribution and the greatest total root zone moisture content were observed in the treatment with only rhizobium under the polythene mulch (i.e., no nitrogen was applied). The populations of soil bacteria and rhizobia were highest in the treatment where nitrogen fertilizer was applied to the crop at 75\% of the recommended rate combined with rhizobium and under polythene mulch. After two cropping seasons, the peanut crop grown under polythene mulch with rhizobium and with nitrogen fertilizer applied at either the full recommended rate or 75\% of this rate performed best in terms of crop productivity, soil nutrient dynamics, and soil moisture.},

The results showed that the simulated cotton phenology and seed cotton yield produced by the calibrated CROPGRO-Cotton model showed good fits with the observed values, thus, satisfying the accuracy requirement for large-scale, mulched, drip irrigated cotton field simulations. However, large deviations were observed between simulated and observed biomass values. According to the simulations, the maximum seed cotton yield and biomass can be obtained from a pre-planting soil water content of 0.8 theta(FC) - theta(FC), and the maintenance of irrigation levels at 30-36 mm during the cotton growing season. These simulation results may serve as reference data for cotton crop production and irrigation management in the Tarim Basin.},

	abstract = {The risks of climate change and soil degradation for the agricultural environment and crop production are increasingly prominent. Based on the limitations of land resources, it is important to explore a sustainable and effective fertilization strategy to reduce risks and ensure there is a high yield of grain and sustainable development of agriculture. Soil fertility underpins cultivated land, which is the most important resource of agricultural production, and is also the key for maintaining agricultural sustainability. The central elements of soil fertility are soil organic carbon (SOC) and soil nitrogen (SN). This study applied the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer-Cropping System Model (DSSAT-CSM) and the CENTURY-based soil module to simulate the trends of crop yields, SN storages and SOC storages until the end of this century under different climate change circumstances, based on a 36-year long-term experiment established at Shenyang site, China. Four fertilizer practices were applied: control (CK), combined chemical fertilizer of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK), NPK with manure (MNPK), and NPK fertilizers plus a high application rate of manure (hMNPK). The outcomes indicated that the DSSAT model can fully simulate the yields of maize and soybean as well as the dynamic stocks of the SN and SOC. Three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5) for future development were chosen from the fifth assessment report of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Moreover, a baseline was installed. Crop yields, SN, and SOC storages from 2016 to 2100 were estimated under four climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 8.5, and Baseline). The RCP scenarios in some treatments reduced SN and SOC stocks and maize yield, and had no effect on soybean yield. However, the application of NPK with manure could improve crop yields, while it increased SN and SOC storages substantially. To some extent, the negative effects of climate scenarios could be mitigated by applying manure. In the RCP 4.5, maize yields of NPK, MNPK, and hMNPK treatments declined by 14.8\%, 7.7\%, and 6.2\%, respectively, compared with that of NPK under Baseline. The NPK fertilizers plus manure treatments could cut the reduction of maize yield caused by climate change in half. Additionally, the SOC storage and SN of chemical fertilizers plus manure treatments under RCP scenarios increased by 20.2\%-33.5\% and 13.7\%-21.7\% compared with that of NPK under baseline, respectively. It was concluded that a rational combination of organic and inorganic fertilizer applications is a sustainable and effective agricultural measure to maintain food security and relieve environmental stresses.},

The experiment was laid out in a split-plot design with two planting systems (bed and conventional) in main plots and a factorial combination of crop duration (50 and 60 days) and cropping systems (sole sorghum, sorghum + cowpea, sorghum + Sesbania in 2:2 ratio) in sub-plots. In the succeeding Eruca sativa crop, residuals and two gypsum levels (0 and 250 kg ha(-1)) were tested. Bed planting practiced during both seasons did not improve the system productivity to significant levels. Extending the duration of fallow replacement crops from 50 to 60 days significantly increased their forage yield, overall system productivity by 25-34\%, and system net returns by 15.9-21.5\%. Amongst the intercropping systems, the sorghum + Sesbania system added 10-13 tonnes ha-1 Sesbania biomass to the soil, resulting in higher soil organic carbon, available nitrogen, dehydrogenase activity, and residual soil moisture, which increased the yield of the succeeding Eruca sativa crop by 8.8-15\% compared to the residual of sole sorghum. However, it could not compensate for the yield loss due to the utilization of 50\% of the area for growing the green manure crop. The sorghum + cowpea intercropping-Eruca sativa system was found to be the optimum combination with a system productivity of 1.27-1.87 Mg ha(-1)Eruca sativa seed equivalent. The productivity of Eruca sativa further improved by 9.5-23.7\% due to the soil application of gypsum @ 250 kg ha-1. When averaged over treatments, fallow replacement during the rainy season reduced the available soil moisture at the sowing of Eruca sativa by 8.3-22.8\% and subsequently its yield by 16.5-30.4\% compared to the fallow-Eruca sativa system. However, with this production penalty, an additional rainy-season fodder crop was successfully grown, which improved the system productivity by 57.7-82.8\%, net returns by 31.2-57.3\%, and rainfall use efficiency from 0.21 to 36 USD/mm(-1) ha(-1). Hence, it may be concluded that short-duration fodder crops may be taken as fallow replacement crops for higher system productivity and rainfall use efficiency.},

Complex and variable geological conditions complicate the prediction of soil moisture in the study area. To achieve this aim, we carried out research on soil moisture inversion methods for channel slopes in the study area using massive monitoring data from multiple GNSS observatories on channel slopes, incorporating GNSS-R techniques and deep learning algorithms. To address the issue of low accuracy in linear inversion when using a single satellite, this study proposes a multi-satellite and multi-frequency data fusion technique. Furthermore, three soil moisture inversion models, namely, the linear model, BP neural network model, and GA-BP neural network model, are established by incorporating deep learning techniques. In comparison with single-satellite data inversion, with the data fusion technique proposed in this study, the correlation is improved by 12.7\%, the root mean square error is reduced by 0.217, the mean square error is decreased by 0.884, and the mean absolute error is decreased by 0.243 with the linear model. With the BP neural network model, the correlation is increased by 15.4\%, the root mean square error is decreased by 0.395, the mean square error is decreased by 0.465, and the mean absolute error is reduced by 0.353. Moreover, with the GA-BP neural network model, the correlation is improved by 6.3\%, the root mean square error is decreased by 1.207, the mean square error is decreased by 0.196, and the mean absolute error is reduced by 0.155. The results indicate that performing data fusion by using multiple satellites and multi-frequency bands is a feasible approach for improving the accuracy of soil moisture inversion. These research findings provide new technical means for the risk analysis of deformation disasters in the expansive soil channel slopes of the South-to-North Water Diversion Middle Route Project.},

Complex signal exchanges and mutual recognition occur between microbes and plants. Here, the phosphate-solubilizing strain Pseudomonas sp. P34, which is a type of PGPR with affinity to wheat, was isolated from a wheat rhizosphere via wheat germ agglutinin. A pTR102 plasmid harboring the luciferase luxAB gene was transferred into P34. The labeled strain (P34-L) was then used to track the temporal and spatial characteristics of rhizosphere colonization and examine the effects of colonization on wheat development. The transcript levels of the phosphate transporter gene TaPT4, a phosphorus deficiency indicator, in wheat roots were monitored by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). The results indicated that P34-L could survive within the wheat rhizosphere for a long time and colonize new spaces in the wheat rhizosphere following the elongation of wheat roots. Compared with uninoculated wheat plants, plants inoculated with P34-L exhibited significantly increased phosphorus accumulation in the leaves; seedling and root weight; total root length; root projection area; root surface area; and number of root tips, forks, and crossings, thus demonstrating the great value of applying this strain in wheat production by promoting root growth and dry matter accumulation. The downregulation of TaPT4 transcript levels in the wheat roots also suggested that a high-phosphorus environment was established by P34-L. These results lay a foundation for further research on the relationships between PGPR and their host plants. Moreover, a potentially ideal biofertilizer-producing strain for use in sustainable agriculture was developed.},

Here, we hypothesized that the apparent P balance of a crop system could be used as an indicator for identifying the critical P input in order to obtain a high yield with high phosphorus use efficiency (PUE). A 12-year field experiment with P fertilization rates of 0, 45, 90, 135, 180, and 225 kg P2O5 ha-1 was conducted to determine the crop yield, PUE, and soil Olsen-P value response to P balance, and to optimize the P input. Annual yield stagnation occurred when the P fertilizer application exceeded a certain level, and high yield and PUE levels were achieved with annual P fertilizer application rates of 90-135 kg P2O5 ha-1. A critical P balance range of 2.15-4.45 kg P ha-1 was recommended to achieve optimum yield with minimal environmental risk. The critical P input range estimated from the P balance was 95.7-101 kg P2O5 ha-1, which improved relative yield ({\textgreater}90\%) and PUE (90.0-94.9\%). In addition, the P input-output balance helps in assessing future changes in Olsen-P values, which increased by 4.07 mg kg-1 of P for every 100 kg of P surplus. Overall, the P balance can be used as a critical indicator for P management in agriculture, providing a robust reference for limiting P excess and developing a more productive, efficient and environmentally friendly P fertilizer management strategy.},

Understanding of the complex responses of soil microbial communities and enzyme activities to different K fertilizer measures while maintaining soil K balance can provide a scientific basis for rational application of K fertilizer. Two field experiment sites (JY, loam soil with high pH and K fertility; GD, silty loam soil with low pH and K fertility) were selected to study the effects of K fertilizer management on enzyme activities and bacterial communities under soil K balance condition. K fertilizer treatments included no K fertilizer (K0), straw return combined with K fertilizer (SRK), and inorganic K fertilizer only (IK). Soil bacterial communities were examined using MiSeq sequencing. Wheat yield, soil nutrient contents, and enzyme activities were higher in the SRK than in the IK and K0 treatments. Available K was the most important factor affecting wheat yield. The SRK and IK treatments significantly altered bacterial communities and enzyme activities, which in turn affected the cycling of soil nutrients. The positive effect of the SRK treatment on wheat yield, enzyme activities, and potential bacterial functions in silty loam soil was greater than that in loam soil, which was closely related to soil texture, pH, and K fertility. The SRK measure is a promising approach to maintain crop yield and soil fertility and more necessary to be adopted in silty loam soil with low pH and K fertility.},

Application of soil amendments has become one of the important strategies for reducing N losses of farmland. However, there is still no systematic study on the effects of various soil amendments on N losses in the HIR. In this study, three types of soil amendments (biochar, bentonite and polyacrylamide) were applied in a maize-wheat rotation system in the HIR during 2015-2017. Yields of maize and wheat, soil NH3 volatilization, N2O emission and NO3- leaching were determined and soil N balance was estimated. The results showed that applications of biochar, bentonite and polyacrylamide significantly increased yields of maize by 9.2\%, 14.3\% and 13.3\%, respectively, and wheat by 9.2\%, 16.6\% and 12.3\%, respectively, compared with the control (fertilization alone). Applications of biochar, bentonite and polyacrylamide significantly reduced soil N leaching by 23.1\%, 35.5\% and 27.1\%, soil NH3-N volatilization by 34.8\%, 52.7\% and 37.8\%, and soil N surplus by 23.9\%, 37.4\% and 30.6\%, respectively. Applications of bentonite and polyacrylamide significantly reduced N2O-N emissions from soil by 37.3\% and 35.8\%, respectively, compared with the control. Compared with application of biochar, applications of bentonite and polyacrylamide increased yields of maize and wheat by 5.1\% and 3.5\%, respectively.

Thus, a 12-year field experiment involving seven N treatments (0, 120, 240, 360, 480, 600, and 720 kg N ha-1 per year) in a typical winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in North China was conducted to investigate the response of crop yield and NUE to the N balance under different N application rates and to identify the N input-output framework. The annual yield increased in a linear-platform and NUE decreased with increasing N fertilizer application. The N balance and yield are strongly correlated to predict changes in yield, and a critical N balance of 44.4-64.9 kg N ha-1 per year was recommended for optimal yield with minimal risk of N loss. The N balance and NUE can be presented in the framework of N input-output, and the critical N input estimated from the N balance of 217-252 kg N ha-1 could obtain high productivity with high NUE (74.3-79.6 \%). Overall, the apparent N balance could be used as a key indicator for optimizing N input, providing a strong reference for limiting N excess in intensive production areas and evaluating agronomic and environmental performance in N management.

A two-year field experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of different water and fertilizer regimes on the soil nutrients and growth of intercropping systems during the crop replacement period. The experiment involved three irrigation levels (0\% (I0), 50\% (I1), and 80\% (I2) of field capacity), two irrigation methods (drip irrigation (DI) and flood irrigation (FI)), and three fertilizer application rates (0 (F0), 375 (F1), and 750 (F2) kg/hm2). The results showed that in 2020 and 2021, the soil water contents increased with increasing irrigation and fertilization. The soil ammonium nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, and soil organic matter contents in 2021 were 21.0\%-68.4\% higher than those in 2020. Increasing the fertilizer application rate improved the photosynthesis rate and transpiration rate of apples and maize in 2020 but had a reverse U-shape effect on soybeans in 2021. Irrigation and fertilization increased soybean and maize yields by 2.9\%-30.5\% compared with the I0F0 treatment. The maize root indicators generally showed an increasing trend followed by a decreasing trend with increasing fertilizer application in 2020, while soybean exhibited an opposite pattern in 2021. The FI1F1 and DI2F2 treatments yielded the optimal economic benefit in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Therefore, from an economic standpoint, FI and DI would have been recommended in 2020 and 2021, respectively. Factor analysis suggested that the DI2F2 treatments had the highest comprehensive benefits over the two years studied. Therefore, we recommend using DI combined with 80\% field capacity irrigation and 750 kg/hm2 fertilization to maximize the comprehensive benefits of intercropping systems during the crop replacement period.},

Moreover, it plays a vital role in climate change, crop growth, and environmental disaster event monitoring, and it is important to monitor soil moisture continuously. Recently, Global Navigation Satellite System interferometric reflectometry (GNSS-IR) technology has become essential for monitoring soil moisture. However, the sparse distribution of GNSS-IR soil moisture sites has hindered the application of soil moisture products. In this paper, we propose a multi-data fusion soil moisture inversion algorithm based on machine learning. The method uses the Genetic Algorithm Back-Propagation (GA-BP) neural network model, by combining GNSS-IR site data with other surface environmental parameters around the site. In turn, soil moisture is obtained by inversion, and we finally obtain a soil moisture product with a high spatial and temporal resolution of 500 m per day. The multi-surface environmental data include latitude and longitude information, rainfall, air temperature, land cover type, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and four topographic factors (elevation, slope, slope direction, and shading). To maximize the spatial and temporal resolution of the GNSS-IR technique within a machine learning framework, we obtained satisfactory results with a cross-validated R-value of 0.8660 and an ubRMSE of 0.0354. This indicates that the machine learning approach learns the complex nonlinear relationships between soil moisture and the input multi-surface environmental data. The soil moisture products were analyzed compared to the contemporaneous rainfall and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s soil moisture products. The results show that the spatial distribution of the GA-BP inversion soil moisture products is more consistent with rainfall and NASA products, which verifies the feasibility of using this experimental model to generate 500 m per day the GA-BP inversion soil moisture products.},

The above-ground biomass, soil properties and endophytic microbes of above-ground tissue and stump root of different age bamboos were quantified, and their interactive relationships were also examined. There were negligible differences in the heights and above-ground fresh biomass among the bamboo plants of different ages, but net nitrogen (N) mineralization and potential nitrification rates of soils were significantly affected by the bamboo ages. The soil nprA gene abundances decreased with the bamboo ages, and soil AOB amoA gene abundances of the 0.5-yr bamboo were significantly higher than those of the other older plants. Average soil urease activities of the 2.5-yr, 4.5-yr and 6.5-yr bamboos were 81.4\%, 81.1\% and 88.2\% lower than those of the 0.5-yr bamboo, respectively. Bacterial diversity indices and richness estimators in the soils were significantly higher than those in the above-ground tissues. Endophytic microbial community structures were more sensitive to the bamboo ages than the soil counterparts, and endophytic microbial community diversities and structures in the above-ground tissues were significantly changed with the bamboo ages. Bacterial and fungal community structures in the above-ground tissues were significantly different from those in the soils. Bamboo ages significantly affected the N transformations in the soils and endophytic community structures, but niche differentiations among the above-ground tissue, stump root and soil outweighed the plant ages in shaping the whole microbial communities of plant-soil system.},

The system nutrient uptake of 219.76 kg N ha(-1), 38.25 kg P ha(-1) and 197.29 kg K ha(-1) and microbial activities in terms of dehydrogenase activity (DHA) (241.9 mg TPF g(-1) soil 24 hr(-1)), alkaline phosphatase activity (APA) (376.7 mg p-nitrophenol kg(-1) soil 1 h(-1)), microbial biomass Carbon (MBC) (260.3 mu g g(-1) of dry soil), microbial biomass nitrogen (MBN) (93.7 mu g N g(-1) soil) was registered with earlier planting, STBFR + FYM in rice and 30 cm row spacing in arhar. Higher positive N and K balance over initial (actual balance) in rice-arhar cropping system was observed in the treatment fertilized with both organic and inorganic sources of nutrients.},

It is important to develop more sustainable, environmentally friendly and high-efficiency agroecosystems for vegetable production in plastic shed systems. Field experiments were performed to explore the impacts of Bacillus megaterium application on cucumber yields, the bioavailability of soil phosphorus (P) and potassium (K), properties of soil microbial communities in a plastic shed production system with cucumber mono-cropped for more than 15 years. The field trails were set up with four treatments of conventional fertilization as control (CON), conventional fertilization with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM), conventional fertilization reduced by 10 \% P and 10 \% (or 5 \%) K from chemical fertilizer with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM PK1), conventional fertilization reduced by 20 \% P and 20 \% (or 10 \%) K from chemical fertilizer with Bacillus megaterium (CON + BM PK2). Results illustrated that CON + BM treatment significantly increased the cucumber yields by 11.8 \%-15.2 \% and P and K accumulation in cucumber fruits and roots by 27.5 \%-46.1 \% and 17.8 \%-45.1 \%, respectively. The treatments of CON + BM PK1 and CON + BM PK2 did not decrease the yields and quality of cucumber, and the bioavailability of soil P and K compared with CON + BM. Moreover, the strain of Bacillus megaterium can efficiently colonize the soil at the early stage of inoculation and improved the richness of soil bacterial and fungal communities significantly. High-throughput sequencing identified that the application of Bacillus megaterium did not change the compositions of the predominant bacterial phyla Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and predominant fungal phylum Ascomycota in soil, but increased the relative abundances of the beneficial bacterial genera and fungal orders and suppressed the development of pathogenic bacterial genus significantly. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that the structures of soil bacterial and fungal communities in the CON + BM treatment were dramatically separated from CON at the early stage of inoculation. Moreover, soil pH, available K (AK), total P (TP), and total K (TK) were dramatically related to the changes of soil bacterial community structure, while soil AK and TK were dramatically linked to the variations of soil fungal community structure. The findings indicated that the application of Bacillus megaterium might contribute to the development of a more sustainable production system of vegetables in plastic shed via improving the properties of soil microbial community and the bioavailability of soil P and K.},

	abstract = {Partial substitution of chemical fertilizers by organic amendments is adopted widely for promoting the availability of soil phosphorus (P) in agricultural production. However, few studies have comprehensively evaluated the effects of long -term organic substitution on soil P availability and microbial activity in greenhouse vegetable fields. A 10-year (2009-2019) field experiment was carried out to investigate the impacts of organic fertilizer substitution on soil P pools, phosphatase activities and the microbial community, and identify factors that regulate these soil P transformation characteristics. Four treatments included 100\% chemical N fertilizer (4CN), 50\% substitution of chemical N by manure (2CN+2MN), straw (2CN+2SN), and combined manure with straw (2CN+1MN+1SN). Compared with the 4CN treatment, organic substitution treatments increased celery and tomato yields by 6.9-13.8\% and 8.6-18.1\%, respectively, with the highest yields being in the 2CN+1MN+1SN treatment. After 10 years of fertilization, organic substitution treatments reduced total P and inorganic P accumulation, increased the concentrations of available P, organic P, and microbial biomass P, and promoted phosphatase activities (alkaline and acid phosphomonoesterase, phosphodiesterase, and phytase) and microbial growth in comparison with the 4CN treatment. Further, organic substitution treatments significantly increased soil C/P, and the partial least squares path model (PLS-PM) revealed that the soil C/P ratio directly and significantly affected phosphatase activities and the microbial biomass and positively influenced soil P pools and vegetable yield. Partial least squares (PLS) regression demonstrated that arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi positively affected phosphatase activities. Our results suggest that organic fertilizer substitution can promote soil P transformation and availability. Combining manure with straw was more effective than applying these materials separately for developing sustainable P management practices.},

Yet, the accuracy and precision of our forecasts remains limited by current tools and methods. To overcome the limitations of process-based models and observed data, we iteratively designed and tested a generalizable and robust data-assimilation system that systematically constrains state variables in the APSIM model to improve forecast accuracy and precision. Our final novel system utilizes the Ensemble Kalman Filter to constrain model states and update model parameters at observed time steps and incorporates an algorithm that improves system performance through the joint estimation of system error matrices. We tested this system at the Energy Farm, a well-monitored research site in central Illinois, where we assimilated observed in situ soil moisture at daily time steps for two years and evaluated how assimilation impacted model forecasts of soil moisture, yield, leaf area index, tile flow, and nitrate leaching by comparing estimates with in situ observations. The system improved the accuracy and precision of soil moisture estimates for the assimilation layers by an average of 42\% and 48\%, respectively, when compared to the free model. Such improvements led to changes in the model's soil water and nitrogen processes and, on average, increased accuracy in forecasts of annual tile flow by 43\% and annual nitrate loads by 10\%. Forecasts of aboveground measures did not dramatically change with assimilation, a fact which highlights the limited potential of soil moisture as a constraint for a site with no water stress. Extending the scope of previous work, our results demonstrate the power of data assimilation to constrain important model estimates beyond the assimilated state variable, such as nitrate leaching. Replication of this study is necessary to further define the limitations and opportunities of the developed system.},

	abstract = {Soil extracellular enzyme activities play an important role in regulating the soil nitrogen (N) mineralization process in paddy fields. However, there is still a need to further study how N mineralization responds to different fertilizer management techniques and the soil extracellular enzyme activities for N mineralization in paddy fields. Therefore, the influence of different long-term (35 years) fertilizer regimes on soil N mineralization, hydrolysable N fractions-such as hydrolyzed unknown nitrogen (HUN), amino acid nitrogen (AAN), amino sugar nitrogen (ASN), ammonia nitrogen (AN), and total acid-hydrolyzed nitrogen (TAN)-and their extracellular enzyme activities (soil urease, L-glutaminase, \& beta;-glucosidase, arylamidase, and \& beta;-glucosaminidase) in a double-cropping rice field in southern China were investigated in this study. The field experiment included the following fertilizer regimes: rice straw and inorganic fertilizer (RF), 30\% organic manure and 70\% inorganic fertilizer (OM), inorganic fertilizer alone (MF), and no application of inorganic fertilizer as a control (CK). The results show that the soil ammonium N, amino sugar N, hydrolysable unidentified N, and amino acid N contents in the paddy field with RF treatment increased by 30.56\%, 5.51\%, and 62.74\% compared with the CK treatment. The results show that the soil aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization rates in the paddy fields with OM and RF treatments increased by 22.92\% and 18.27\% compared with those with MF treatment. Moreover, soil extracellular enzyme activities under RF and OM treatments significantly increased, which indicated that the main substrate of microbial activity was effective. Correlation analysis indicated that the soil L-glutaminase activity, amino sugar N, amino acid N, and total acid-hydrolysable N contents were positively correlated with soil aerobic and anaerobic N mineralization rates in paddy fields. However, there was a negative correlation between the soil N mineralization rate and soil \& beta;-glucosaminidase activity in paddy fields. This finding shows that the yields of early rice and late rice under the RF and OM treatments were significantly higher than those under the MF and CK treatments. Compared with the MF treatment, the yields of double-cropping rice with RF and OM treatments increased by 9.84\% and 11.37\%, respectively. As a result, the application of straw or organic manure and inorganic fertilizer was effective for improving soil N mineralization, the soil acid-hydrolyzed N content, and extracellular enzyme activities in double-cropping rice fields.},

Treatments included planting method (on raised beds or flat ground), fertilizer source (granular feather meal or fish solubles) and rate (”low” and “high” rates of 29 and 57 kg.ha(-1) N, respectively, during establishment, increased incrementally as the planting matured to 73 and 140 kg.ha(-1) N, respectively), mulch [sawdust, yard-debris compost topped with sawdust (compost + sawdust), or black, woven polyethylene groundcover (weed mat)], and cultivar (Duke or Liberty). Mulches were replenished, as needed, and weeds were controlled throughout the study. The impacts of year, planting method, fertilizer, mulch, and cultivar on leaf and soil nutrient levels over this 10-year study were complex with many interactions among treatments. Soil pH remained within the recommended range for all treatments. Plants fertilized with fish solubles had higher leaf N, P, and K concentrations than those fertilized with feather meal, particularly at the high N rate in both cultivars. By contrast, fertilization with feather meal increased leaf Ca. Compost + sawdust added a cumulative (2007-16) total of 2274, 400, 961, and 2744 kg.ha(-1) of N, P, K, and Ca, respectively, over the use of sawdust alone, and increased the concentration of P, K (as much as 90\%), Ca, and Mg in the soil relative to other mulches. Soil organic matter content averaged 4.1\% under compost + sawdust, 3.3\% under sawdust, and 2.9\% under weed mat, averaged over the last 5 years. Mulching with weed mat or compost + sawdust increased leaf K compared with sawdust in both cultivars, regardless of fertilizer treatment. Leaf Ca, on the other hand, was highest with sawdust and tended to be lowest with weed mat in both cultivars. Soil nutrient levels were not consistently correlated with leaf nutrient concentrations, other than between soil NO3-N and leaf N (5 years) and between soil and leaf K (4 years). On average, raised beds resulted in higher concentrations of N, P, K, Fe, and Al and lower concentrations of Ca, Mg, and B in the leaves than planting on flat ground. Furthermore, concentrations of N and Ca in recent fully-expanded leaves at standard sampling time was higher in young plants than in mature plants in both cultivars, whereas the opposite was found for leaf P. In `Duke', yield was positively correlated with leaf Ca in 8 out of 9 years and negatively correlated with leaf K and P in 5 and 6 years, respectively. Leaf Ca and Mg were also negatively correlated with leaf K in most years for both cultivars, as was leaf N. Although leaf N concentration was higher with added compost, regardless of fertilizer source in `Duke', and when fertilized with feather meal in `Liberty', this was not correlated with yield. High N rates increased leaf N concentration, but did not result in greater yield. While soil and leaf tissue testing are important to help manage fertilizer programs, the lack of a consistent relationship between soil and plant nutrient status and yield was a reflection of the complicated interactions that occurred among nutrients in these organic production systems. Soil nutrient imbalances and changes in leaf nutrient concentrations associated with extended use of compost + sawdust mulch and fish solubles may lead to growth and yield problems in longer-lived plantings. In addition, the loss of organic matter under weed mat would need to be addressed in long-term plantings for sustainable production.},

The RCIP-SA system combined rainwater collection systems, infiltration promoting tube and soil anti-seepage layer to gather limited rainwater resources into the soil layer where the roots of apple tree were concentrated. To evaluate the effect of the RCIP-SA system on soil moisture change and fine root distribution, a field experiment was completed in a hilly apple orchard on the Loess Plateau of China from 2017 to 2019. The results showed that the soil moisture of the RCIP-SA system was 24.0-43.9\% higher than CK in the 0-60 cm soil layer in the rainwater collection ditch, and generated a larger area with higher moisture content near the impermeable layer during the apple tree growth period. The RCIP-SA system also expanded the dense distribution zone of apple tree roots. The dry fine root densities of apple trees in the RCIP-SA system in the 0-200 cm soil layer was 11.7-59.6\% and 18.2-30.3\% higher than CK under the plastic film (60 cm from the trunk) and edge of the rainwater collection ditch (100 cm from the trunk), respectively. Soil moisture and root distribution of apple trees were significantly different under different impermeable layers, and compacted red clay as the impermeable layer was the best anti-seepage strategy in RCIP-SA systems. The RCIP-SA system brought higher economic benefits; the average yield per tree was recorded for red clay compaction treatment (38.1 kg.tree(-1)), equating to a production level of 22 800 kg.ha(-1), and a difference of 9.6 kg.tree(-1) with CK treatment, equating to 5700 kg.ha(-1). This strategy should be recommended as an agricultural measurement for apple production on the Loess Plateau of China.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an ensemble square root filter (EnSRF) in the context of jointly assimilating observations of surface soil moisture (SSM) and the leaf area index (LAI) in the Land Data Assimilation System LDAS-Monde. By ingesting those satellite-derived products, LDAS-Monde constrains the Interaction between Soil, Biosphere and Atmosphere (ISBA) land surface model (LSM), coupled with the CNRM (Centre National de Recherches Meteorologiques) version of the Total Runoff Integrating Pathways (CTRIP) model to improve the reanalysis of land surface variables (LSVs). To evaluate its ability to produce improved LSVs reanalyses, the EnSRF is compared with the simplified extended Kalman filter (SEKF), which has been well studied within the LDAS-Monde framework. The comparison is carried out over the Euro-Mediterranean region at a 0.25 degrees spatial resolution between 2008 and 2017. Both data assimilation approaches provide a positive impact on SSM and LAI estimates with respect to the model alone, putting them closer to assimilated observations. The SEKF and the EnSRF have a similar behaviour for LAI showing performance levels that are influenced by the vegetation type. For SSM, EnSRF estimates tend to be closer to observations than SEKF values. The comparison between the two data assimilation approaches is also carried out on unobserved soil moisture in the other layers of soil. Unobserved control variables are updated in the EnSRF through covariances and correlations sampled from the ensemble linking them to observed control variables. In our context, a strong correlation between SSM and soil moisture in deeper soil layers is found, as expected, showing seasonal patterns that vary geographically. Moderate correlation and anti-correlations are also noticed between LAI and soil moisture, varying in space and time. Their absolute value, reaching their maximum in summer and their minimum in winter, tends to be larger for soil moisture in root-zone areas, showing that assimilating LAI can have an influence on soil moisture. Finally an independent evaluation of both assimilation approaches is conducted using satellite estimates of evapotranspiration (ET) and gross primary production (GPP) as well as measures of river discharges from gauging stations. The EnSRF shows a systematic albeit moderate improvement of root mean square differences (RMSDs) and correlations for ET and GPP products, but its main improvement is observed on river discharges with a high positive impact on Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency scores. Compared to the EnSRF, the SEKF displays a more contrasting performance.},

The accuracy of model predictions relies heavily on model parameterization. The sensitivity and uncertainty of the simulations of soil N cycle of winter wheat-summer maize rotation system in the North China Plain (NCP) to the parameters were analyzed. First, the N module in the Vegetation Interface Processes (VIP) model was expanded to capture the dynamics of soil N cycle calibrated with field measurements in three ecological stations from 2000 to 2015. Second, the Morris and Sobol' algorithms were adopted to identify the sensitive parameters that impact soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate. Finally, the shuffled complex evolution developed at the University of Arizona (SCE-UA) algorithm was used to optimize the selected sensitive parameters to improve prediction accuracy. The results showed that the sensitive parameters related to soil nitrate stock included the potential nitrification rate, Michaelis constant, microbial C/N ratio, and slow humus C/N ratio, the sensitive parameters related to denitrification rate were the potential denitrification rate, Michaelis constant, and N2O production rate, and the sensitive parameters related to ammonia volatilization rate included the coefficient of ammonia volatilization exchange and potential nitrification rate. Based on the optimized parameters, prediction efficiency was notably increased with the highest coefficient of determination being approximately 0.8. Moreover, the average relative interval length at the 95\% confidence level for soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate were 11.92, 0.008, and 4.26, respectively, and the percentages of coverage of the measured values in the 95\% confidence interval were 68\%, 86\%, and 92\%, respectively. By identifying sensitive parameters related to soil N, the expanded VIP model optimized by the SCE-UA algorithm can effectively simulate the dynamics of soil nitrate stock, denitrification rate, and ammonia volatilization rate in the NCP.},
