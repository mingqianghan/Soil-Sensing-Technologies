	abstract = {colon; High-quality soil moisture (SM) datasets are in great demand for climate, hydrology, and other fields, but detailed evaluation of SM products from various sources is scarce. Thus, using 670 SM stations worldwide, we evaluated and compared SM products from microwave remote sensing [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (C- and X-bands) and European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)], land surface model [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)], and reanalysis data [ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)] under different time scales and various climates and land covers. We find that: (a) ESA CCI and GLDAS have the closest values to the in situ SM on the annual scale, whereas others overestimate the SM; ERA-Interim (averaged R = 0.58) and ESA CCI (averaged R = 0.54) correlate best with the in situ data, while GLDAS performs worst. (b) Overall, the deviations of each product vary in seasons. ESA CCI and ERA-Interim products are closer to the in situ SM at seasonal scales, and AMSR-E and NCEP perform worst in December-February and June-August, respectively. (c) Except for NCEP and ERA-Interim, others can well reflect the intermonthly variation of the in situ SM. (d) Under various climates and land covers, AMSR-E products are less effective in cold climates, whereas GLDAS and NCEP products perform poorly in arid or temperate and dry climates. Moreover, the Bias and R of each SM product differ obviously under different forest types, especially the AMSR-E products. In summary, SM from ESA CCI is the best, followed by ERA-Interim product, and precipitation is an important auxiliary data for selecting high-quality SM stations and improving the accuracy of SM from GLDAS. These results can provide a reference for improving the accuracy of the above SM products., : Soil moisture products from various sources are evaluated. European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI), a microwave remote sensing product, is closest to in situ soil moisture, followed by ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim), a reanalysis product, whereas Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), a land model product, is in poor simulation performance, possibly due to failure to capture the single precipitation event well., (C) 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Soil nitrogen (N) is controlled by several environmental factors. However, it is unclear how these factors and their interactions affect soil N fractions (SNFs) because of the lack of systematic N extraction methods. The Harbin-Dali belt, a transect more than 3,300 km long across China covering various climates, topographies, soil parent materials and vegetation types, was taken as the study area, and the interactive effects on SNFs in largely undisturbed woodlands and grasslands were explored using three SNFs: labile N, moderately stable N and stable N. The soil N fractions were obtained through a novel sequential extraction method that used distilled H2O, 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 M HCl, 6 M HCl, mixed acid (1 M HCl and 5 M HF; MA), concentrated HCl (cHCl) and concentrated H2SO4 as extractive agents to successively separate H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl-, 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N fractions. The results showed that increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) directly decreased the concentrations of H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N, suggesting that warming may reduce available N. The interactions between MAT, parent material, aspect and aridity index also contributed to the three SNFs. Vegetation and its interactions with parent material primarily controlled 6 M HCl-, cHCl- and RES-N, and climate and topography had indirect effects during these processes. Particularly, more cHCl- and RES-N were accumulated in areas with warm humid climates and rich vegetation species than in other environments. Moreover, soil labile N (H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N) and cHCl-N exhibited potential as sensitive indicators for reflecting the changes in MAT and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, the various interactions between climate and other environmental factors controlled the changes in most SNFs. This novel sequential extraction method thus offers a reliable analytical approach to measuring SNFs., (C) 2022 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {Preventing soil nitrogen (N) losses driven by microbial nitrification and denitrification contributes to improving global environmental concerns caused by NO3--N leaching and N2O emission. Quorum sensing (QS) signals regulate nitrification and denitrification of N-cycling bacteria in pure culture and water treatment systems, and mediate the composition of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) in activated sludge. However, whether disrupting QS could prevent soil N losses remains unclear. This study explored the feasibility of applying quorum sensing inhibitors (QSIs) as an innovative strategy to reduce N losses from agricultural soils. The two QSIs, penicillic acid and 4-iodo-N-[(3S)-tetrahydro-2-oxo-3-furanyl]-benzeneacetamide (4-iodo PHL), were more effective in reducing N losses than traditional inhibitors, including N-(n-butyl) thiophosphoric triamide and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate. After 36 days of aerobic incubation, penicillic acid and 4-iodo PHL inhibited nitrification by 39\% and 68\%, respectively. The inhibitory effects are attributed to the fact that 4-iodo PHL decreased the abundance of archaeal and bacterial amoA genes, as well as the relative abundance of Candidatus Nitrocosmicus (AOA), Candidatus Nitrososphaera (AOA), and Nitrospira (nitrite-oxidizing bacteria/comammox), while penicillic acid reduced archaeal amoA abundance and the relative abundance of Nitrosospira (AOB) and the microbes listed above. Penicillic acid also strongly inhibited denitrification (33\%) and N2O emissions (61\%) at the peak of N2O production (day 4 of anaerobic incubation) via decreasing nitrate reductase gene (narG) abundance and increasing N2O reductase gene (nosZ) abundance, respectively. Furthermore, the environmental risks of QSIs to microbial community structure and network stability, CO2 emissions, and soil animals were acceptable. Overall, QSIs have application potential in agriculture to reduce soil N losses and the associated effect on climate change. This study established a new method to mitigate N losses from the perspective of QS, and can serve as important basis of decreasing the environmental risks of agricultural non-point source pollution., * Penicillic acid and 4-iodo PHL can inhibit the nitrification of agricultural soils., * Penicillic acid can inhibit the soil denitrification and N2O emissions., * QSIs perform better than NBPT and DMPP in reducing soil N losses., * Applying QSIs is identical to a "pulse" disturbance on soil microbial communities., * The risks of applying penicillic acid to soil ecosystems are acceptable., (C) 2024Elsevier, Inc.},

A clear understanding of the temporal dynamics and the soil moisture spatial variability (SMSV) will help to control soil degradation by hydrological processes. This study represents the first attempt connecting cosmic-ray neutron sensors (CRNS) with soil erosion research, a novel approach to explore the complex relationships between soil water content (SWC) and soil redistribution processes using two of the most powerful nuclear techniques, CRNS and fallout 137Cs., Our preliminary results indicate that CRNS captured soil moisture dynamics along the study toposequence and demonstrated the sensitivity of neutron sensors to investigate the effect of parent material on soil water content. The Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis of the comprehensive data from seven CRNS surveys revealed that one dominant spatial structure (EOF1) explains 89.2\% of SMSV. The soil redistribution rates estimated with 137Cs at the nine locations along the hillslope, together with local factors related to soil properties (SOC, soil depth, hydraulic conductivity) and land use showed significant correlations with EOF. This study provides strong field evidence that soil type significantly affect SMSV, highlighting the key impact on soil erosion and sedimentation rates. Nevertheless, more research is needed to investigate the specific contributions of soil properties to the spatial variability of soil moisture and their subsequent effects on soil redistribution dynamics of interest for soil management., * Combining nuclear techniques for exploring soil moisture and soil redistribution., * Parent material controls soil moisture spatial variability (SMSV)., * Seven CRNS surveys at nine locations captured 85.5\% of SMSV using EOF analysis., * Soil depth, hydraulic conductivity, erosion rates and SOC significantly affect SVSM., * CRNS and 137Cs provide insights into the link between SWC and soil redistribution., (C) 2023Elsevier, Inc.},

	abstract = {: Soil moisture in the root zone is the most important factor in eco-hydrological processes. Even though soil moisture can be obtained by remote sensing, limited to the top few centimeters ({\textless}5 cm). Researchers have attempted to estimate root-zone soil moisture using multiple regression, data assimilation, and data-driven methods. However, correlations between root-zone soil moisture and its related variables, including surface soil moisture, always appear nonlinear, which is difficult to extract and express using typical statistical methods. The artificial intelligence (AI) method, which is advantageous for nonlinear relationship analysis and extraction is applied for root-zone soil moisture estimation, but by only considering its separate temporal or spatial correlations. The convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) model, known to capture spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale sequential datasets with the advantage of dealing with spatiotemporal sequence-forecasting problem, was used in this study to estimate root-zone soil moisture based on remote sensing-based variables. Owing to limitation of regional soil moisture observation data, the physical model Hydrus-1D was used to generate large and spatiotemporal vertical soil moisture dataset for the ConvLSTM model training and verification. Then, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) etc. remote sensing-based factors were selected as predictive variables. Results of the ConvLSTM model showed that the fitting coefficients (R2) of the root-zone soil moisture estimation significantly increased compared to those achieved by Global Land Data Assimilation System products, especially for deep layers. For example, R2 increased from 0.02 to 0.60 at depth of 40 cm. This study suggests that a combination of the physical model and AI is a flexible tool capable of predicting spatiotemporally continuous root-zone soil moisture with good accuracy on a large scale., (C) 2022Elsevier, Inc.},

	abstract = {The accuracy and precision of the cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS) neutron count and soil moisture estimate are affected differently by distinct neutron moderating factors. Moreover, whereas the accuracy can be improved by correcting for different hydrogen pools, the precision can only be improved by increasing the surface area of the CRNS sensors or by increasing the integration time. To date, the effects of different neutron moderating factors on CRNS accuracy and precision are not completely understood. We used data from three agricultural and low biomass sites located within a few kilometres distance from each other in South England. We developed an extended version of the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Interaction Code (COSMIC), which included the effects of relevant neutron moderating factors on the neutron counts. With sensitivity analysis, we found atmospheric pressure and soil moisture content to be most influential on neutron count accuracy and precision. These two factors were, respectively, seven and four times more important than soil bulk density, lattice water and soil organic matter. Above ground biomass was substantially less influential compared to these variables. However, because the three sites had similar soil organic matter and meteorology, calibration results showed that differences between sites could be mostly explained by differences in above ground biomass and to a lesser extent intercepted water. The neutron count differences due to above ground biomass corresponded with substantial soil moisture estimate differences up to Symbol; a significant effect on soil moisture accuracy. The precision of the soil moisture estimate was 10 times more sensitive to soil moisture than other factors and was therefore mostly a function of soil moisture content itself. The neutron count integration times required to obtain a soil moisture precision were typically less than a day.

In this study, the multi-layer root zone soil moisture (0-5, 0-10, 10-40 and 40-100 cm) prediction is conducted over an agriculture dominant basin, namely the Xiang River Basin, in southern China. The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF, respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than 47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%. However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF. (c) The SVM-EnKF can eliminate the influence of remote sensing soil moisture extreme values in soil moisture prediction, therefore, improve its accuracy., : The performance of SVM is better in the surface moisture prediction (0-10 cm) than in the deeper layers (10-100 cm). Compare to SVM, SVM-EnKF can significantly improve the accuracy of multi-layer soil moisture prediction, and its performance remains stable.

	abstract = {Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets, there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices, which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan. The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2\% in volumetric water content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and 297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77\% originates from irrigation., : Approach to quantify ETact, GWR and water inflow that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, acid environments. It combines soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is a key modifier of runoff generation from rainfall excess, including during extreme precipitation events associated with Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This paper presents a new, publicly available dataset from a soil moisture monitoring network in Northern California's Russian River Basin, designed to assess soil moisture controls on runoff generation under AR conditions. The observations consist of 2-min volumetric soil moisture at 19 sites and 6 depths (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 cm), starting in summer 2017. The goals of this monitoring network are to aid the development of research applications and situational awareness tools for Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations at Lake Mendocino. We present short analyses of these data to demonstrate their capability to characterize soil moisture responses to precipitation across sites and depths, including time series analysis, correlation analysis, and identification of soil saturation thresholds that induce runoff. Our results show strong inter-site Pearson's correlations ({\textgreater}0.8) at the seasonal timescale. Correlations are strong ({\textgreater}0.8) during events with high antecedent soil moisture and during drydown periods, and weak ({\textless}0.5) otherwise. High event runoff ratios are observed when antecedent soil moisture thresholds are exceeded, and when antecedent runoff is high. Although local heterogeneity in soil moisture can limit the utility of point source data in some hydrologic model applications, our analyses indicate three ways in which soil moisture data are valuable for model design: (1) sensors installed at 6 depths per location enable us to identify the soil depth below which evapotranspiration and saturation dynamics change, and therefore choose model soil layer depths, (2) time series analysis indicates the role of soil moisture processes in controlling runoff ratio during precipitation, which hydrologic models should replicate, and (3) spatial correlation analysis of the soil moisture fluctuations helps identify when and where distributed hydrologic modelling may be beneficial., : We present a publicly available, high-resolution soil moisture dataset from Russian River Basin in California designed to assess soil moisture controls on runoff generation under atmospheric river conditions. Analyses of the results demonstrate that: (1) Multi-depth sensors are valuable for identifying which depths show differences in evapotranspiration and soil saturation dynamics, (2) Understanding the factors influencing event runoff ratio during a precipitation event enables us to design evaluation techniques and indicates soil moisture processes that distributed hydrologic models should replicate., (C) 2021 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {: We evaluated the effects of different methods of installing a capacitance soil moisture sensor on the sensor's output with six soil types and three methods of sensor installation. For Method 1, the sensor was first placed in a container and then buried. For Method 2, the entire sensor (including prongs and circuitry) was inserted into a prepacked soil sample. For Method 3, the sensor prongs were installed directly into a prepacked soil sample, and then soil was placed around the circuitry. The sensor outputs of Method 1 were significantly smaller for the volumetric soil water content ([theta]) of most of the soil types compared with the sensor outputs of the other two methods. Large differences in sensor outputs were observed in relation to the installation method, which resulted in a large estimation error when using a soil moisture sensor. For example, the difference in [theta] values calculated by the calibration equation obtained by Methods 1 and 2 was 0.076 m3 m-3, a maximum for the Andisol sample. We observed a significant linear relation between the maximum differences in [theta] (which might result from the different sensor installation methods) and the coarse pore volume determined from soil water characteristic curves. Compaction around the sensor induced by sensor installation, which might be considerable for soil with many coarse pores, was considered the main reason for an increase in the soil moisture sensor's output value. For the sensor installed by Methods 2 or 3, a second-order polynomial equation could be used to translate sensor output to [theta] accurately except for soils with {\textgreater} 40\% clay content or very low bulk density., Highlights:, * An appropriate calibration equation is important to monitor soil water content precisely., * Effects of different sensor installation methods on calibration equations have not been determined., * Method of installation considerably affected output values of a capacitance sensor., * Soil compaction by sensor installation increases the sensor output: more so in coarse pore soil., (C) 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {colon; The field deployment of a heated distributed temperature sensor (DTS) for over three years has revealed two obstacles to estimating soil moisture ([THETA]) that may hamper subsurface DTS applications as well as use of other subsurface thermal probes. The first observed obstacle was a hysteretic response of the DTS sensor. The relationship between [THETA] and the temperature response ([DELTA]T) within the cable was not only dependent on [THETA] of the soil, but also on the previous wetting and drying cycles leading to that state. The second observed obstacle was soil structure healing. Soil structure healing causes the relationship between [DELTA]T and [THETA] to evolve through time; this calibration curve becomes flatter, or less sensitive, as the surrounding soil makes better contact with the cable. Effects of the hysteretic response of the instrument and soil structure healing are largely the result of small gaps between the cable and soil. These small gaps can be approximated by a contact resistance between the cable and soil. In this article we characterize the occurrence of hysteretic and soil structure healing effects from field data and parameterize contact resistance by simulating heat transfer using a numerical modelling approach Copyright (C) 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd., (C) 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Results show that fusion of the SMA\_CN method causes decrease in runoff volume and increase in profile soil moisture content, associated with larger groundwater contribution to the streamflow. In addition, the higher amount of moisture in the soil profile slightly elevates the actual evapotranspiration. The SMA-based SWAT configuration consistently produces improved goodness-of-fit scores and less uncertain outputs with respect to streamflow during both calibration and validation. The SMA\_CN method exhibits a better match with the observed data for all flow regimes, thereby addressing issues related to peak and low flow predictions by SWAT in many past studies. Comparison of the calibrated model outputs with field-scale soil moisture observations reveals that the SMA overhauling enables SWAT to represent soil moisture condition more accurately, with better response to the incident rainfall dynamics. While the results from the modification of the CN method in SWAT are promising, more studies including watersheds with various physical and climatic settings are needed to validate the proposed approach.

	abstract = {Plants in the field are exposed to varying light and moisture. Agronomic improvement requires knowledge of whole-plant phenotypes expressed in response to simultaneous variation in these essential resources. Most phenotypes, however, have been described from experiments where resources are varied singularly. To test the importance of varying shoot and root resources for phenotyping studies, sister pre-breeding lines of wheat were phenotyped in response to independent or simultaneous exposure to two light levels and soil moisture profiles. The distribution and architecture of the root systems depended strongly on the moisture of the deeper soil layer. For one genotype, roots, specifically lateral roots, were stimulated to grow into moist soil when the upper zone was well-watered and were inhibited by drier deep zones. In contrast, the other genotype showed much less plasticity and responsiveness to upper moist soil, but maintained deeper penetration of roots into the dry layer. The sum of shoot and root responses was greater when treated simultaneously to low light and low soil water, compared to each treatment alone, suggesting the value of whole plant phenotyping in response to multiple conditions for agronomic improvement. The results suggest that canopy management for increased irradiation of leaves would encourage root growth into deeper drier soil, and that genetic variation within closely related breeding lines may exist to favour surface root growth in response to irrigation or in-season rainfall., (C) Society for Experimental Biology 2015.

	abstract = {colon; Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture, but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and thermal remote-sensing images [e.g. using the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3 years. In situ soil moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability in degree of saturation for this region.

	abstract = {: This paper presents a multi-sensor remote sensing study of physically crusted soil with various moisture contents by using millimetre-wave backscatter radiation. The backscattered radiation was used to generate an empirical model to estimate soil moisture at the thin surface crust scale by using a set of soils with known moisture content as a reference. The model was then used to assess the moisture content of a new set of soils from the same group. Real-time measurement of soil moisture in the top layer beneath the soil crust is impractical at best and impossible using traditional methods. The proposed method, therefore, paves the way to assessing soil moisture content immediately beneath the surface crust as well as in a micro-profile at depths of 0-3 cm. It can be combined with other active and passive remote sensing methods to provide a micro-profile measurement of soil moisture to the depth of the entire upper root zone (0-30 cm) and of the plough layer (0-20 cm) under undisturbed conditions. The method is based on the emerging technology of millimetre waves, which provide improved spatial resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Further development and use of the method described herein will make it simple and practical to analyse and understand the processes governing the soil-water interface. The major processes for which this information is important are soil crusting, water budgets (infiltration, runoff and evaporation) and soil erosion., (C) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd},

	abstract = {: This paper presents the results of a two-year experiment carried out in mountain areas on soil moisture retrieval from remotely sensed images. In particular, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT and single polarization ASAR images were used. During acquisitions of SAR over the test area in Alto Adige, Sudtirol region, northern Italy, extensive field measurements were carried out to characterize the area in terms of soil moisture variability, vegetation cover and soil properties. The area is equipped with 17 meteorological stations that also provide information on soil moisture on an hourly basis. To deal with the process of soil moisture retrieval from SAR images in this challenging environment, an advanced algorithm based on the support vector regression (SVR) technique and the integration of ancillary data were successfully proposed. The selected method was also combined with an innovative multi-objective strategy for model selection. The results indicate that the use of polarimetric features such as horizontal-horizontal polarization (HH) and horizontal-vertical polarization (HV) channels improves the estimation of SMC in the mountain area investigated, in particular because the HV channel contributes to disentangling the effect of vegetation on the radar signal. The root mean square error (RMSE) indicates accuracy of retrieval for soil moisture values of around 5\%, which is well within the requirements for estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed data.

Soil moisture data are also required for reservoir management, early warning of droughts, irrigation scheduling, and crop yield forecasting. Coastal soils in general span the gamut of soil properties necessary for agriculture and maintaining natural environments, including transitional wetlands. Beach characteristics, such as soil moisture, grain size and type, are needed for determining substrate-bearing strength, modeling beach erosion, and planning beach nourishment. Because microwave radiation from soil is strongly dependent on moisture content, soil moisture has traditionally been mapped with airborne microwave radiometers. Innovative antenna technology has enabled microwave radiometers on satellites, such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Aqua, to measure soil moisture on a global scale. Better corrections for surface roughness, vegetation cover, soil temperature, and topography must still be devised, and techniques for sensing soil moisture beyond the top few centimeters developed., (C) 2014 Allen Press},

	abstract = {: While soil moisture patterns can be interesting traits to investigate spatio-temporal heterogeneity of catchments relevant for various physical processes of soil-atmosphere interaction and soil water redistribution, many of the existing methods to capture spatial patterns are time consuming, expensive or need site-specific calibration. In this study we present a quick and inexpensive supplementary field method for classifying soil wetness in wet environments. The seven wetness classes are based on qualitative indicators, which one can touch, hear or see on the soil surface. To counter critics that such qualitative methods are considerably affected by subjectivity, we performed systematic testing of the method by taking qualitative measurements in the field with 20 non-expert raters. We then analyzed these in terms of degree of agreement and assessed the results against gravimetric sampling and time domain reflectometry measurements. In 70\% of all classifications raters agreed on the wetness class assigned to the marked sampling locations and in 95\% they were not off by more than one wetness class. The seven quantitative wetness classes agreed with gravimetric and time domain reflectometry measurements, although intermediate to wet classes showed an overlap of their range whereas the driest classes showed considerable spread. Despite some potential to optimize the method, it has been shown to be a reliable supplement to existing quantitative techniques for assessing soil moisture patterns in wet environments.

	doi = {10.1002/hyp.8363},
	abstract = {: Soil moisture influences many hydrologic applications including agriculture, land management and flood prediction. Most remote-sensing methods that estimate soil moisture produce coarse resolution patterns, so methods are required to downscale such patterns to the resolutions required by these applications (e.g. 10- to 30-m grid cells). At such resolutions, topography is known to affect soil moisture patterns. Although methods have been proposed to downscale soil moisture based on topography, they usually require the availability of past high-resolution soil moisture patterns from the application region. The objective of this article is to determine whether a single topographic-based downscaling method can be used at multiple locations without relying on detailed local observations. The evaluated downscaling method is developed on the basis of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of space-time soil moisture data at a reference catchment. The most important EOFs are then estimated from topographic attributes, and the associated expansion coefficients are estimated on the basis of the spatial-average soil moisture. To test the portability of this EOF-based method, it is developed separately using four data sets (Tarrawarra, Tarrawarra 2, Cache la Poudre and Satellite Station), and the relationships that are derived from these data sets to estimate the EOFs and expansion coefficients are compared. In addition, each of these downscaling methods is applied not only for the catchment where it was developed but also to the other three catchments. The results suggest that the EOF downscaling method performs well for the location where it is developed, but its performance degrades when applied to other catchments., Copyright (C) 2012 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

This study validated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E) soil moisture data with the Common Land Model (CLM), one of the most widely used LSMs, and ground-based measurements at two Korean regional flux monitoring network sites. There was reasonable agreement regarding the different soil moisture products for monitoring temporal trends except National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) AMSR-E soil moisture, albeit there were essential comparison limitations by different spatial scales and soil depths. The AMSR-E soil moisture data published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) showed potential to replicate temporal variability patterns (root-mean-square errors = 0[middle dot]10-0[middle dot]14 m3 m-3 and wet BIAS = 0[middle dot]09 - 0[middle dot]04 m3 m-3) with the CLM and ground-based measurements. However, the NSIDC AMSR-E soil moisture was problematic because of the extremely low temporal variability and the VUA AMSR-E soil moisture was relatively inaccurate in Gwangneung site characterized by complex geophysical conditions.

Soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system/Noah land surface model are validated with ground-truth data from 102 soil moisture monitoring sites. The validated soil moisture is used in combination with in situ groundwater data to quantify total water storage change (TWSC) in the region. The estimated storage change is in turn compared with gravity recovery and climate experiment-derived TWSC for the study area. The soil moisture and TWSC terms show favourable agreements, with discrepancies of {\textless} 10\% on the average. While there is no consistent seasonal trend in soil moisture, TWSC shows a strong seasonality. It is low in spring and high in summer. This trend corresponds with the IRR-PPT season in the study area. Change in groundwater and total water storage indicates storage depletion in the basin. Storage depletion in the region is driven mainly by groundwater IRR and ET loss. Despite the low PPT and high ET, there is narrowing seasonal trend in soil moisture. This is achieved at the expense of groundwater storage. IRR pumping has induced extensive groundwater depletion in the basin. It is therefore vital to develop cultivation strategies that aim at limiting IRR pumping and ET loss. Water management practices that not only reduce waste but also ensure high productivity and ecological sustainability could also mitigate storage depletion in the region. These measures could reduce further not only the seasonal trend in soil moisture but also that in groundwater storage.

	abstract = {Many contract swine producers are located in the southeastern U.S. In this region almost all of the swine effluent from swine production is applied to warm-season perennial species such as bermudagrass [Cynodon dactylon (L.) Pers.] which is widely grown for summer grazing and hay production. A 3-yr study was conducted to investigate the impact of forage double-cropping on nutrient accumulation and leaching in Mantachie fine loam soil fertilized with swine (Sus scrofa domesticus) lagoon effluent as the source of plant nutrients. Plots of previously established Tifton 44 bermudagrass were overseeded in the fall with one of four winter annuals: berseem clover (Trifolium alexandrinum L.); crimson clover (T. incarnatum L.); ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum L.); or wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). Four plots of bermudagrass were not overseeded and considered as control. Plots were harvested in spring for cool-season annual hay and in summer for bermudagrass hay. Swine effluent was applied during spring and summer on a need base. Suction lysimeters were installed in selected plots at two depths to monitor nutrient leaching. Surface soil samples were taken to determine baseline nutrient contents, followed by three other sampling dates during the study. Bermudagrass dry matter production(3-yr average = 9.8 Mg ha-1) was not adversely affected by the overseeding treatments. Greatest dry matter production was achieved with bermudagrass overseeded with ryegrass (3-yr average = 11.3 Mg ha-1). Soil pH decreased by almost one unit by the end of the study. While total P (TP) did not change much, Mehlich-3 P (M3-P), K, Cu, and Zn increased significantly, Mg and Mn concentrations decreased by 2002 compared to the baseline levels. Soil P, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, and Zn accumulation were greater under bermudagrass/wheat combination. In general, the influence of double cropping on soil nutrient accumulation was not conclusive, however, this practice provides the year-round green forage for grazing and haying. Nutrient concentrations in soil and lysimeter leachate were directly related to the quantity of effluent applied. Results also demonstrated that effluent application must be coordinated with the nutrient requirements of the growing forages in order to minimize accumulation and leaching., (C)2008 Kluwer Academic Publishers},

	abstract = {When soil moisture is heterogeneous, sap flow from, and ABA status of, different parts of the root system impact on leaf xylem ABA concentration ([X-ABA]leaf). The robustness of a model for predicting [X-ABA]leaf was assessed. 'Two root-one shoot' grafted sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) plants received either deficit irrigation (DI, each root system received the same irrigation volumes) or partial rootzone drying (PRD, only one root system was watered and the other dried the soil). Irrespective of whether relative sap flow was assessed using sap flow sensors in vivo or by pressurization of de-topped roots, each root system contributed similarly to total sap flow during DI, while sap flow from roots in drying soil declined linearly with soil water potential ([PSI]soil) during PRD. Although [PSI]soil of the irrigated pot determined the threshold [PSI]soil at which sap flow from roots in drying soil decreased, the slope of this decrease was independent of the wet pot [PSI]soil. Irrespective of whether sap was collected from the wet or dry root system of PRD plants, or a DI plant, root xylem ABA concentration increased as [PSI]soil declined. The model, which weighted ABA contributions of each root system according to the sap flow from each, almost perfectly explained [X-ABA] immediately above the graft union. That the model overestimated measured [X-ABA]leaf may result from changes in [X-ABA] along the transport pathway or an artefact of collecting xylem sap from detached leaves. The implications of declining sap flow through partially dry roots during PRD for the control of stomatal behaviour and irrigation scheduling are discussed., (C) Society for Experimental Biology 2008.

	abstract = {A 3-year field trial of sugarcane, comprising 11 treatment combinations of different organic manures with and without Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus (Gd), NPK and an absolute control, on an inceptisol was conducted to assess the effect of these treatments on sugarcane total and economic yield, the benefit:cost ratio, nutrient balance and soil quality in a sugarcane plant-ratoon system. The highest cane yield (78.6tha-1) was recorded in the plant crop given vermicompost+Gd, whereas ratoon yields (first and second) were highest (80.8 and 74.9t/ha-1, respectively) with sulphitation press mud cake (SPMC)+Gd. In both plant and ratoon crops, a number of different organic manures produced the highest cane yield that was also statistically similar to those obtained with using the recommended NPK levels (76.1, 78.2 and 71.7t/ha for plant crop and subsequent two ratoons, respectively). The highest benefit:cost (B:C) ratio in the plant and two ratoon crops (1.28, 2.36, 2.03 respectively) were obtained with the addition of SPMC+Gd. The nutrient balance for NPK in the soil was highest in the SPMC+Gd treatment. The highest increase in organic C (94\%) and total N (87\%), in comparison to the initial level, and soil microbial biomass C (113\%) and soil microbial biomass N (229\%), in comparison to the control treatment, was recorded with the addition of SPMC+Gd. The maximum decrease in soil bulk density (BD) (12\%) with an increase in soil aggregate (17\%) and water infiltration rate (35\%) was obtained with the addition of SPMC. Overall, the sugarcane crop responded well to different organic manures in a multiple ratooning system with a better economic output and improved soil quality. Strategic planning in terms of an integrated application of these manures with inorganic chemicals will not only sustain our soils but will also be beneficial for our farmers in terms of reducing their dependence and expenditure on chemical fertilizers., (C)2007 Kluwer Academic Publishers},

The study was conducted on a mountainous hillslope of the Sulmachun catchment (northeastern South Korea). The positions of soil moisture sensors were determined through a sequential procedure including intensive geomorphologic surveying of the study area, surface and subsurface terrain analysis, and inverse surveying. Using 26 sensors, soil moisture data from 11 locations were measured and recorded at hourly intervals over 380 h from 6 to 22 November 2003. Soil moisture response patterns were captured for a few consecutive rainfall events. The monitoring results are discussed in the context of soil moisture variations with terrain attributes. The immediate recharge and fast recession after a peak are the primary features of soil moisture in the upper zone. Stability and significant storage increase are distinct characteristics of soil moisture in the buffer zone and the flow path zone respectively. Spatial distribution of temporal soil moisture variations can be characterized in terms of recession, stability and recharge depending upon the topographic classification of a hillslope for this approach., Copyright (C) 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

(2005) pointed out several inconsistencies in the soil moisture accounting (SMA) procedure used in the SCS-CN method and developed a procedure that is more consistent from the SMA viewpoint. However, the model proposed by them does not have any expression for initial soil moisture store level (V0) and hence there is a scope for further improvement. Like the original method, there is sudden jump in V0 and therefore a quantum jump in computed runoff is possible. In the present study, an attempt is made to develop an expression for V0 to make the model a continuous watershed model. Then, the performance of the new model is compared with the model proposed by Michel et al. and the original SCS-CN model by applying them in a large number of small watersheds in the United States.

A mobile time-domain reflectometry (TDR) unit for geo-referenced soil measurements has been developed and used for detailed mapping of soil water content and electrical conductivity within two research fields. Measurements made during the early or late season, when soil moisture levels are close to field capacity, are related to the amount of plant available water and soil texture. Combined measurements of water content and electrical conductivity are closely related to the clay and silt fractions of a variable field. The application to early season field mapping of water content, electrical conductivity and clay content is presented. The water and clay content maps are to be used for automated delineation of field management units. Based on a spatial analysis of the soil water measurements, recommendations are made with respect to sampling strategies.

However, this way may not adequately represent soil water conditions of fields and watersheds in the Loess Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effective soil moisture depth to which the CN is most related; (2) to evaluate a discrete and a linear relationship between AMC and soil moisture; and (3) to develop an equation between CN and soil moisture to predict runoff better for the climatic and soil conditions of the Loess Plateau of China. The dataset consisted of 10 years of rainfall, runoff and soil moisture measurements from four experimental plots cropped with millet, pasture and potatoes. Results indicate that the standard CN method underestimated runoff depths for 85 of the 98 observed plot-runoff events, with a model efficiency E of only 0[middle dot]243. For our experimental conditions, the discrete and linear approaches improved runoff estimation, but still underestimated most runoff events, with E values of 0[middle dot]428 and 0[middle dot]445 respectively. Based on the measured CN values and soil moisture values in the top 15 cm of the soil, a non-linear equation was developed that predicted runoff better with an E value of 0[middle dot]779.

	abstract = {Maintenance of soil organic carbon (SOC) is important for the long-term productivity of agroecosystems. An investigation was conducted to study the effects of long-term application of inorganic fertilizers and farmyard manure (FYM) on soil organic carbon (SOC), nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrient content, water-stable aggregate distribution, and aggregate-associated carbon in a field experiment started in 1982 in an arid region of northwest China. Application of inorganic fertilizer alone (N, NP, or NPK treatments) did not increase SOC concentrations compared with no application of fertilizers (CK) and SOC concentration was significantly reduced, by 18\% on average, compared with the initial value at the beginning of the experiment. Application of imbalanced inorganic fertilizer (N and NP), especially, resulted in a significant decrease in available phosphorus and potassium nutrients at a depth of 20 cm. This indicates that long-term application of inorganic fertilizers were inadequate to maintain levels of SOC and nutrients under conventional management with no aboveground crop residues returning to the soil. Long-term application of FYM alone or combined with inorganic fertilizers (M (FYM), MN, MNPK, or MNPK treatments), however, improved SOC and total nitrogen concentrations from initial values of 12.1 and 0.76 g kg-1, respectively, to 15.46 and 1.28 g kg-1, on average, and also enhanced available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium concentrations by 47, 50, and 68\%, respectively, during the 23-year period. Treatment with FYM resulted in a 0.48 mm greater average mean weight diameter (MWD) of aggregates and a higher percentage of macro-aggregates ({\textgreater}2 mm) and small macro-aggregates (2-0.25 mm) than treatment without FYM. The MWD increased with increasing SOC concentration (R2=0.75). The SOC concentration was highest in small macro-aggregates, intermediate in macro-aggregates, and lowest in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm). Approximately 54-60\% of total SOC was stored in micro-aggregates (0.25-0.05 mm) and sand+silt fractions ({\textless}0.05 mm) after treatment without FYM but 57-64\% of total SOC was stored in macro-aggregates ({\textgreater}0.25 mm) after treatment with FYM.

Soil moisture measurement data are essential for quantifying recharge using the water balance method. The spacing and zone of influence of soil moisture sensors used in a study are important factors for the accuracy of recharge calculations. A large lysimeter was used to measure the water balance components to quantify groundwater recharge in South Florida as a function of soil moisture and water table levels. Recharge was calculated using sensor spacings of 10 and 20 cm and zone of influence of 10 and 20 cm for seven major rainfall events. Recharge calculated with a sensor spacing of 20 cm had a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 33.1\% as compared with the 10-cm spacing. Recharge calculated using a zone of influence of 20 cm had an RRMSE of 38.8\% as compared with the 10-cm zone of influence. This error is attributed to soil moisture sensor discretization, which results in averaging the soil moisture in a soil layer containing the saturated and unsaturated zones interface, which leads to an overestimation of soil moisture in the unsaturated zone and an underestimation of soil moisture in the saturated zone. Vertical spacing of sensors larger than the sensors zone of influence also gives erroneous results as portions of the soil profile are not measured. For groundwater recharge calculations, selecting a sensor with suitable zone of influence and appropriate sensor spacing can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the calculations., (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

We compared the ability of near infrared (NIR; 400-2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR; 2,500-25,000 nm) spectroscopy for field-scale acquisition of soil fertility parameters. Samples were obtained in a grid pattern (25 m spacing) from the surface (0-10 cm) and sub-surface (10-30 cm) samples collected at 272 locations. Samples were analyzed for organic C and total N, texture (clay, silt, and sand), soil pH, and Mehlich I extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P. We found that chemometric analyses NIR and MIR provided good calibrations for organic carbon, total N, and soil texture. To varying degrees of precision, these regions also calibrated for pH and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K. Exchangeable P did not form useful calibrations in either spectral region. In all cases, MIR calibrations were better than those formed in the NIR region. Test of calibrations based on one-third of the samples was used to predict the remaining samples. This demonstrated the strategy of developing field-scale calibrations for the spectral regions by chemical analysis of a small sub-set of samples for the prediction of large numbers of samples. This approach can be used to accurately map the spatial distribution of soil properties within agricultural landscapes.

The objectives of this study were to examine the influence of moisture content on the accuracy of NIRS analysis of soil properties and to assess the robustness of a NIRS multivariate calibration technique. Four hundred agricultural soil samples ({\textless}2 mm) from Iowa and Minnesota were studied at two moisture levels: moist and air-dried. The soil properties tested included total C, organic C, inorganic C, total N, CEC, pH, texture, moisture, and potentially mineralizable N. About 70\% of the Iowa samples were selected for the calibration set, and the rest of the Iowa samples and all of the Minnesota samples were assigned to validation set I and validation set II, respectively. Calibrations were based on partial least-squares regression (PLSR), using the first differentials of log (1/R) for the 1100 to 2500-nm spectral range. The results for the calibration set and validation set I indicated that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict many soil properties (total C, organic C, inorganic C, total N, CEC, \% clay, and moisture) with reasonable accuracy for both the air-dried (R2 {\textgreater} 0.76) and moist (R2 {\textgreater} 0.74) soils. The results for validation set II showed that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict some properties of soils (total C, organic C, total N, and moisture content) from a different geographic region, but other soil properties in validation set II were not accurately predicted. Although NIRS-PLSR predictions are slightly more accurate for air-dried soils than for moist soils, the results indicate that the NIRS-PLSR technique can be used for analysis of field moist samples with acceptable accuracy as long as diverse soil samples from the same region are included in the calibration database., (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {Quantification of groundwater recharge is essential for water resources management. The water balance method is one of several methods for measuring event-based groundwater recharge. Soil moisture measurement data are essential for quantifying recharge using the water balance method. The spacing and zone of influence of soil moisture sensors used in a study are important factors for the accuracy of recharge calculations. A large lysimeter was used to measure the water balance components to quantify groundwater recharge in South Florida as a function of soil moisture and water table levels. Recharge was calculated using sensor spacings of 10 and 20 cm and zone of influence of 10 and 20 cm for seven major rainfall events. Recharge calculated with a sensor spacing of 20 cm had a relative root mean square error (RRMSE) of 33.1\% as compared with the 10-cm spacing. Recharge calculated using a zone of influence of 20 cm had an RRMSE of 38.8\% as compared with the 10-cm zone of influence. This error is attributed to soil moisture sensor discretization, which results in averaging the soil moisture in a soil layer containing the saturated and unsaturated zones interface, which leads to an overestimation of soil moisture in the unsaturated zone and an underestimation of soil moisture in the saturated zone. Vertical spacing of sensors larger than the sensors zone of influence also gives erroneous results as portions of the soil profile are not measured. For groundwater recharge calculations, selecting a sensor with suitable zone of influence and appropriate sensor spacing can have a significant effect on the accuracy of the calculations., (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {Data-intensive technologies such as precision agriculture require new approaches for acquisition of soil data on landscapes. We compared the ability of near infrared (NIR; 400-2500 nm) and mid infrared (MIR; 2,500-25,000 nm) spectroscopy for field-scale acquisition of soil fertility parameters. Samples were obtained in a grid pattern (25 m spacing) from the surface (0-10 cm) and sub-surface (10-30 cm) samples collected at 272 locations. Samples were analyzed for organic C and total N, texture (clay, silt, and sand), soil pH, and Mehlich I extractable Ca, K, Mg, and P. We found that chemometric analyses NIR and MIR provided good calibrations for organic carbon, total N, and soil texture. To varying degrees of precision, these regions also calibrated for pH and exchangeable Ca, Mg, and K. Exchangeable P did not form useful calibrations in either spectral region. In all cases, MIR calibrations were better than those formed in the NIR region. Test of calibrations based on one-third of the samples was used to predict the remaining samples. This demonstrated the strategy of developing field-scale calibrations for the spectral regions by chemical analysis of a small sub-set of samples for the prediction of large numbers of samples. This approach can be used to accurately map the spatial distribution of soil properties within agricultural landscapes. These studies demonstrate the utility of infrared spectral approaches for generating the spatial soil properties data needed to implement precision agriculture technology., (C) 2006 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

	abstract = {Near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS), a nondestructive analytical technique, may someday be used to rapidly and simultaneously quantify several soil properties in agricultural fields. The objectives of this study were to examine the influence of moisture content on the accuracy of NIRS analysis of soil properties and to assess the robustness of a NIRS multivariate calibration technique. Four hundred agricultural soil samples ({\textless}2 mm) from Iowa and Minnesota were studied at two moisture levels: moist and air-dried. The soil properties tested included total C, organic C, inorganic C, total N, CEC, pH, texture, moisture, and potentially mineralizable N. About 70\% of the Iowa samples were selected for the calibration set, and the rest of the Iowa samples and all of the Minnesota samples were assigned to validation set I and validation set II, respectively. Calibrations were based on partial least-squares regression (PLSR), using the first differentials of log (1/R) for the 1100 to 2500-nm spectral range. The results for the calibration set and validation set I indicated that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict many soil properties (total C, organic C, inorganic C, total N, CEC, \% clay, and moisture) with reasonable accuracy for both the air-dried (R2 {\textgreater} 0.76) and moist (R2 {\textgreater} 0.74) soils. The results for validation set II showed that NIRS-PLSR was able to predict some properties of soils (total C, organic C, total N, and moisture content) from a different geographic region, but other soil properties in validation set II were not accurately predicted. Although NIRS-PLSR predictions are slightly more accurate for air-dried soils than for moist soils, the results indicate that the NIRS-PLSR technique can be used for analysis of field moist samples with acceptable accuracy as long as diverse soil samples from the same region are included in the calibration database., (C) 2005 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},
