	abstract = {Subsurface drip irrigation (SDI) systems are increasingly being used in agriculture in attempts to use the available water more efficiently. The proper design and management of SDI systems requires knowledge of precise distribution of water around emitters. We conducted both field and numerical experiments to evaluate the soil water content distributions between two neighboring emitters when their wetting patterns started to overlap. The experiments involved SDI systems with emitters installed at different depths and with different spacings along the drip lateral. The HYDRUS software package was used to analyze the field data, assuming modeling approaches in which emitters were represented as (i) a point source in an axisymmetrical two-dimensional domain, (ii) a line source in a planar two-dimensional domain, or (iii) a point source in a fully three-dimensional domain. Results indicated that SDI systems can be accurately described using an axisymmetrical two-dimensional model only before wetting patterns start to overlap, and a planar two-dimensional model only after full merging of the wetting fronts from neighboring emitters. A fully three-dimensional model appears to be required for describing subsurface drip irrigation processes in their entirety.},

	abstract = {The dual-probe heat-pulse (DPHP) method is attractive for measuring soil thermal properties and volumetric water content. The purpose of this study was to develop and test a DPHP sensor having rigid probes made from thick-walled stainless steel tubing (2.38-mm outside diameter). The probes of this sensor are much more resistant to deflection than those of conventional DPHP sensors, decreasing measurement error caused by probe deflection during insertion into the soil. Laboratory experiments were conducted across a wide range of saturation levels with glass beads and three soils of different textures. For inferring soil properties from the proposed sensor, we applied the recently developed identical cylindrical perfect conductors (ICPC) model instead of the infinite line source (ILS) model that is typically used. The ICPC model improves solution for heat transport through the probe–soil system by accounting for the heat capacity and radius of the probes. Our results show a root mean square error of 1.4\% volumetric water content and elimination of the measurement bias typically encountered with DPHP measurements. We conclude that the improved sensor, in combination with the ICPC model, provides a general, soil-independent water content estimate that is especially suitable for field soil water content monitoring because of its robust design with rigid probes. Because of its simplicity and measurements independent of soil type, we propose the presented DPHP method as an excellent alternative to other available measurement techniques for soil water content.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Satellites, particularly at L-band frequency, can globally map near-surface soil moisture. Near-surface moisture is extended to the root zone using models and data assimilation. Validation uses core monitoring sites, monitoring networks, field campaigns, and multi-satellite comparisons. Efforts are underway to associate soil moisture variability dynamics with land surface attributes. This is an update to the special section “Remote Sensing for Vadose Zone Hydrology—A Synthesis from the Vantage Point” [Vadose Zone Journal 12(3)]. Satellites (e.g., Soil Moisture Active Passive [SMAP] and Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [SMOS]) using passive microwave techniques, in particular at L-band frequency, have shown good promise for global mapping of near-surface (0–5-cm) soil moisture at a spatial resolution of 25 to 40 km and temporal resolution of 2 to 3 d. C- and X-band soil moisture records date back to 1978, making available an invaluable data set for long-term climate research. Near-surface soil moisture is further extended to the root zone (top 1 m) using process-based models and data assimilation schemes. Validation of remotely sensed soil moisture products has been ongoing using core monitoring sites, sparse monitoring networks, intensive field campaigns, as well as multi-satellite comparison studies. To transfer empirical observations across space and time scales and to develop improved retrieval algorithms at various resolutions, several efforts are underway to associate soil moisture variability dynamics with land surface attributes in various energy- and water-rich environments. We describe the most recent scientific and technological advances in soil moisture remote sensing. We anticipate that remotely sensed soil moisture will find many applications in vadose zone hydrology in the coming decades.},

The sensing mechanism relates the sensor's resonant frequency to the soil moisture content changes over time. For experimental validation purposes, a compact sensor prototype (75 mm × 35 mm × 1.55 mm and 12 g) with fundamental resonant frequency at 958 MHz was built and submitted to calibration process on typically sandy and clay soils to get fitting models capable to estimate soil moisture content. Simulated and experimental results are presented together and show good agreement with each other. The calibration data for both soil types were processed using the least-squares method and the proposed curve-fitting models are capable to estimate soil moisture content levels from 5\% to 20\% for sandy soil and from 12\% to 23\% for clay soil with satisfactory accuracy, proving the device viability.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study developed a uniplanar multirod time domain reflectometry (TDR) probe and evaluated it in laboratory experiments for soil water measurement over a larger spatial scale. The sampling volume of the probe was determined by simulating the electric potential distribution around the probe rods by using the HYDRUS-2D software package and verified by comparison with the measured dielectric constant in saturated sand. The performance of the probe was evaluated by comparing its dielectric measurements in wet sand over a wide range of water content during evaporative drying with that measured by CS640 probes. Additionally, the dependency of visible light reflection on the water content of the sand was evaluated. The results revealed that the average effective thickness of the probe's sampling volume was 5–6 cm on both sides of the plane of the probe rods. The probe accurately measured the soil water content over a 0.88 m2 spatial area. The visible light reflectance of the variably saturated sand surface and the corresponding water content of the sand follow a soil water retention function-type relationship. The usage of the multirod TDR measurement system at a larger spatial scale carries practical implications, especially in increasing the accuracy of remote sensing data.},

	abstract = {Abstract Triple collocation (TC) is routinely used to resolve approximated linear relationships between different measurements (or representations) of a geophysical variable that are subject to errors. It has been utilized in the context of calibration, validation, bias correction, and error characterization to allow comparisons of diverse data records from various direct and indirect measurement techniques including in situ remote sensing and model-based approaches. However, successful applications of TC require sufficiently large numbers of coincident data points from three independent time series and, within the analysis period, homogeneity of their linear relationships and error structures. These conditions are difficult to realize in practice due to infrequent spatiotemporal sampling of satellite and ground-based sensors. TC can, however, be generalized within the framework of instrumental variable (IV) regression theory to address some of the conceptual constraints of TC. We review the theoretics of IV and consider one possible strategy to circumvent the three-data constraint by use of lagged variables (LV) as instruments. This particular implementation of IV is suitable for circumstances where multiple data records are limited and the geophysical variable of interest is sampled at time intervals shorter than its temporal correlation length. As a demonstration of utility, the LV method is applied to microwave satellite soil moisture data sets to recover their errors over Australia and to estimate temporal properties of their relationships with in situ and model data. These results are compared against standard two-data linear estimators and the TC estimator as benchmark.},

	abstract = {Abstract Abrupt onset and swift intensification characterize flash droughts. Global surface soil moisture (θRS) from NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite can facilitate a near-real-time assessment of emerging flash droughts at a 36-km footprint. However, a robust flash drought monitoring using θRS must account for the (a) short observation record of SMAP, (b) nonlinear geophysical controls over θRS dynamics, and (c) emergent meteorological drivers of flash droughts. We propose a new method for near-real-time characterization of droughts using Soil Moisture Stress (SMS, drought stress) and Relative Rate of Drydown (RRD, drought stress intensification rate)—developed using SMAP θRS (March 2015–May 2021), footprint-scale seasonal soil water retention parameters and land-atmospheric coupling strength. SMS and RRD are nonlinearly combined to develop Flash Drought Stress Index (FDSI) to characterize emerging flash droughts (FDSI ≥ 0.71 for moderate to high RRD and SMS). Globally, FDSI shows a high correlation with concurrent meteorological anomalies. A mechanistic evaluation of flash droughts is presented for the Northern Great Plains, Central South Africa, and Eastern Australia using FDSI, SMS, and RRD. About 5.6\% of the earth's landmass experienced flash droughts of varying intensity and duration during 2015–2021 (FDSI ≥ 0.71 for {\textgreater}30 consecutive days), majorly in global drylands. FDSI shows high skill in forecasting vegetation health with a lead of 0–2 weeks, with exceptions in irrigated croplands and mixed forests. With readily available parameters, low data latency, and no dependence on model simulations, we provide a robust tool for global near-real-time flash drought monitoring using SMAP.},

	abstract = {Abstract In order to improve the yield of crops, the method of soil water content detection and analysis based on experimental reflectance spectrum data is adopted. From the four aspects of the farmland soil water detection based on reflection spectrum information, soil water content detection in farmland based on spectral absorption characteristics, remote sensing inversion of soil water content of farmland by reflectance spectra data, and soil water content detection in farmland based on near-infrared spectroscopy, the soil water content of farmland can be analyzed. The absorption valley near 1,920 nm is the characteristic absorption valley of soil water in the black soil, which can be used to predict the water content of the black soil by the spectral characteristic parameters of the absorption valley; soil water will increase the absorption of radiation energy and reduce the overall reflectance spectra of soil. The quantitative monitoring of soil water content can be achieved by using the remote sensing model of soil water content in this paper. In the range of low soil water content, the reflectance decreases with the increase of soil water content in farmland, whereas in the range of high soil water content, it increases with the increase of soil water content in farmland. The correlation between soil water content and normalized spectral reflectance is positive and negative correlation and mainly negative correlation. The method can detect soil water content in farmland under extreme conditions of different texture, soil water, salinity, and organic matter. It is an effective method for soil water content detection.},

	abstract = {Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a standard method to estimate soil water content and bulk soil electrical conductivity. In many applications, several TDR probes are installed in soil columns or field setups, and TDR measurements are acquired using a multiplexing system. Commercially available multiplexers share a common ground, which might lead to inaccurate TDR measurements when probes are installed close together or at sites with high electromagnetic noise. Therefore, a new eight-channel differential multiplexer (50C81-SDM) was developed that allows communication with standard TDR equipment. In a first step, the new multiplexer was tested to analyze channel noise and channel to channel variability for open reflection coefficients and travel times. The results indicate that there is no significant difference between the channels for both the open reflection coefficient and travel times. Second, the 50C81-SDM multiplexer was tested using TDR probes installed in electrolyte solutions and a sand tank. In contrast to multiplexers with a common ground, they showed no interference of closely spaced TDR probes (spacing ranging from 5 to 95 cm). On the other hand, the SDMX50 multiplexer showed absolute differences in bulk electrical conductivities of {\textgreater}0.001 Sm−1 for high volumetric water contents and high bulk electrical conductivities. Measurements at a test site with high electromagnetic noise showed the applicability of the 50C81-SDM multiplexer in such environments, but only if the entire TDR setup was disconnected from the permanent power supply.},

Tillage treatments were no-tillage and conventional tillage. Preceding crops, in 2-yr rotations, were sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), faba bean (Vicia faba L.), fallow, and continuous wheat. Nitrogen fertilizer rates were 0, 50, 100, and 150 kg N ha−1 applied to wheat only. No-tillage did not provide more water at wheat planting for any of the rotations. Preceding crop effect on soil water content (SWC) at planting was as follows: fallow ≥ faba bean {\textgreater} wheat ≥ chickpea {\textgreater} sunflower. At harvest, SWC was higher in continuous wheat. Only at harvest were there differences among N fertilizer rates for SWC. Besides, measurement of SWC at harvest for sunflower, chickpea, faba bean, and fallow were performed to determine soil water storage and precipitation storage efficiency (PSE) for 2 yr. Soil water storage was higher for rotations with sunflower or fallow. Nevertheless, fallow PSE was the lowest (10\%). The mean PSE was 29\%. Under the conditions of this study, no-tillage is not more efficient than conventional tillage in soil water accumulation. Fallow is not a useful tool for increasing water availability.},

	abstract = {It has been recently demonstrated that the early-time portion of the ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signal, consisting of the direct air and ground wave events, is dependent on the shallow subsurface bulk electromagnetic properties of the material; these properties are strongly controlled by the water content in this material. While several controlled experiments have been conducted to study the effects of water content variations on the antenna–material coupling, they considered a limited range of moisture variations and soil textures. Furthermore, those previous experiments did not consider highly dynamic shallow moisture responses that would be encountered under natural field conditions. For these reasons, general acceptance of this method requires that it be tested in real-life applications. Our paper evaluates the early-time GPR technique under natural field conditions where surface roughness, lithology, lateral heterogeneities, vegetation and water content dynamics are not controlled. We assess the capacity of the early-time amplitude technique over the complete annual cycle of soil moisture conditions at three textural sites. To evaluate the sensitivity of the early-time amplitudes to subsurface water content variations, we compare the early-time results acquired using the enveloped amplitude of the first part of GPR signals with the bulk dielectric permittivity obtained from concurrently collected common-midpoint direct ground wave velocity and gravimetric water content measurements. Our results demonstrate that the early-time method can yield near-surface permittivity information that is consistent with that obtained from direct ground wave velocity measurements, and accurate predictions of shallow soil moisture conditions.},

	abstract = {Summary To reduce the possibility of probe deflections, conventional thermo-time domain reflectometry (T-TDR) sensors have relatively short probe lengths (≤4 cm). However, short probes lead to large errors in TDR-estimated soil water content (θv). In this study, two new 6-cm-long probe-spacing-correction T-TDR (CT-TDR) sensors were investigated. Compared with conventional 4-cm-long T-TDR sensors, the 6-cm-long CT-TDR sensors reduced errors in TDR-estimated θv. Errors in heat pulse (HP)-estimated θv because of probe deflections were reduced when linear or nonlinear probe-spacing-correction algorithms were implemented. The 6-cm-long CT-TDR sensors provided more accurate θv estimations than do the conventional 4-cm-long T-TDR sensors. Highlights Short thermo-TDR sensor has shortcomings in determining soil water content. Changes in thermo-TDR probe spacing caused by deflections can be determined in situ. Correcting changed thermo-TDR probe spacing determined soil water content accurately. The 6-cm-long thermo-TDR sensors determined soil water content more accurately than 4-cm-long sensors.},

	abstract = {Ring-capacitor sensors are used widely for real-time estimation of volumetric soil water content θ from measured resonant frequency fr, which is directly affected by the bulk soil permittivity ε. However, the relationship fr(ε) requires improved quantification. We conducted laboratory experiments to characterize the response of the Sentek EnviroSMART sensor system for a full range of ε values from air to water and a range of temperatures. Water–dioxane mixtures were placed into a solvent-resistant container equipped with custom tools for heating and mixing the fluid, removing air bubbles from sensitive surfaces, measuring permittivity in situ, and creating an axisymmetric metal disturbance to the electric field. Total capacitance C was measured using a vector network analyzer (VNA) connected to one sensor, while four other sensors provided replicated fr readings. The measured temperature response of free water permittivity was linear with a negative slope, which is qualitatively consistent with theory. A precise nonlinear relationship between ε and normalized fr was derived. The instrumental error in ε was RMSEε = 0.226 (for 3 {\textless} ε {\textless} 43), which corresponds to a measurement precision in θ(ε) derived from Topp's equation of RMSEθ= 0.0034 m3m−3 Axisymmetric numerical simulations of the electric field supplemented the experimental results. The characteristic length scale for the distance measured radially from the access tube is 12.5 mm, meaning that 80 and 95\% of the signal are sensed within approximately 20 and 37 mm of the access tube, respectively. The results are crucial for scientific applications of the investigated sensor type to environmental media.},

	abstract = {Wireless sensor networks are becoming more popular to monitor spatial and temporal variability of soil water content. The aim of this paper is to calibrate and test the newly developed SPADE sensor for wireless sensor network applications. During calibration, the measured sensor output is related to dielectric permittivity using an empirical calibration in liquids with well-defined permittivities. Using these calibration measurements, we have evaluated sensor-to-sensor variability and compared the accuracy of a universal calibration between sensor output and permittivity with a sensor-specific calibration. Our results showed that the sensor-to-sensor variability of the SPADE sensor is larger than sensor noise and that a sensor-specific calibration can improve the accuracy of soil water content estimation as compared to a single universal calibration. To quantify the effect of temperature on the sensor output, we have derived a temperature correction function in a temperature range from 5 to 40°C. The results showed an underestimation for low temperatures (5 to 25°C) and an overestimation for high temperatures (25 to 40°C). A second-order polynomial function was fitted to the measurements with good agreement (R2 = 0.9831, RMSE = 0.1489). The transferability of the temperature correction function from reference liquids to soils was verified using saturated coarse sand and a silty loam soil sample. The temperature-corrected SPADE sensor measurements in soil showed good agreement with TDR measurements and corresponded well with theoretical predictions from a dielectric mixing model.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the feedback mechanisms between soil water content (SWC) and biomass production is important for sustainable resources management. Here we present a new method enabling simultaneous noninvasive measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics based on cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS). Recently, it was suggested that the neutron ratio (Nr) between thermal neutron (TN) and fast neutron (FN) intensity contains information on other hydrogen pools like vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. The aim of this study is to evaluate the accuracy of simultaneous measurements of SWC and biomass dynamics during agricultural drought conditions using CRNS probes. To this end, we instrumented an arable field cropped with sugar beet with CRNS probes and a wireless in situ SWC sensor network. Belowground and aboveground biomass were sampled in monthly intervals. We found a linear relationship between Nr and the aboveground biomass that allowed to continuously quantify the dry aboveground biomass development throughout the growing season with a root-mean-square error from 0.14 to 0.22 kg/m2. This information was used together with measured belowground biomass to correct for the effect of biomass on SWC determination with CRNS probes, which increased the accuracy of the SWC estimates considerably as indicated by the decrease of the root-mean-square error from 0.046 to 0.013 cm3/cm3. We anticipate that future research on the Nr can further improve the accuracy of SWC and biomass estimates and extend the application of CRNS to include canopy interception, ponding water, and snow water equivalent estimation for both stationary and roving CRNS systems.},

In this study we examine θ − t and θ − εbulk relations and temperature dependency for natural sand and glass beads in a laboratory using commercially available TDR sensors. As a result, this study clarifies that TDR sensors are applicable even in a hyper-arid environment when calibration was properly made.

After calibration of the effective heater–thermistor spacing from temperature response measurements in agar, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to demonstrate the potential advantages of the BHPP. Measurement accuracy and robustness of the BHPP were significantly improved compared with the conventional HPP. Errors associated with needle deflection were eliminated by the design, whereas the water content measurement sensitivity was increased by the central placement of the thermistor. We used inverse modeling with a finite-element heat transport model to illustrate the increased sensitivity of the BHPP to soil water content measurements.},

	abstract = {The TRIME-FM3 (Imko GmbH, Ettlingen, Germany) time domain reflectometry (TDR) handheld instrument combined with the T3 access tube probe is a commercial soil water content (SWC) profiling system. The main purpose of this study was to evaluate its performance under real field conditions. The evaluation was performed on four sites in Tunisia and France where several measuring campaigns were organized between 2000 and 2002. Reference SWC measurements were also taken systematically. Direct comparisons of the corresponding data showed that a linear correction was generally sufficient to locally calibrate the TRIME (time domain reflectometry with intelligent microelements) measurements. Nevertheless, because of the influence of other interfering factors, a significant error (0.01 {\textless} RMSE {\textless} 0.07) still remained after this correction. As a possible alternative, the internal standard TRIME-FM3 calibration was also examined. On the basis of our large set of data, new calibration coefficients were derived to convert the TRIME-FM3 internal measurement (a so-called pseudo transit time) into the displayed SWC. However, its general validity should be tested with other independent data. Several laboratory experiments were also performed: TRIME-tube measurements were taken on reference media and on a 10-L sample of soil that was monitored twice during drying from total water saturation to an equilibrium dry state. It was thus possible to quantify the sensitivity of the TRIME-tube measurement to the surrounding medium permittivity. An empirical formula was also established for inferring the soil permittivity from the TRIME-tube measured pseudo transit time.},

As a nationwide climate network, the network stations are distributed across vast complex terrains. Due to the expansive distribution of the network and the related variability in soil properties, obtaining site-specific calibrations for sensors is a significant and costly endeavor. Presented here are three commercial-grade electromagnetic sensors, with built-in thermistors to measure both soil water and soil temperature, including the SoilVUE10 Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) probe (hereafter called SP) (Campbell Scientific, Inc.), 50 MHz coaxial impedance dielectric sensor (model HydraProbe, Stevens Water Monitoring Systems, Inc.) (hereafter called HP), and the TDR-315L Probe (model TDR-315L, Acclima, Inc.) (hereafter called AP), which were evaluated in a relatively nonconductive loam soil in Oak Ridge, TN, from 2021 to 2022. The HP manufacturer-supplied calibration equation for loam soils was used in this study. While volumetric water content data from HP and AP were 82–99\% of respective gravimetric observations at 10 cm, data from SP were only 65–81\% of respective gravimetric observations in the top 20-cm soil horizon, where soil water showed relatively large spatial variability. The poor performance of the SP is likely due to poor contact between SP sensor electrodes and soil and the presence of soil voids caused by the installation method used, which itself may have caused soil disturbance.},

The existing ground level neutron monitoring network provides continuous and well-characterized measurements of the radiation environment. However, there are only a few dozen active stations worldwide, and there has not been a UK-based station for several decades. Much smaller neutron detectors are increasingly deployed throughout the world with the purpose of using secondary neutrons from cosmic rays to monitor local soil moisture conditions (COSMOS). Space weather signals from GLEs and Forbush decreases have been identified in COSMOS data. Monte Carlo simulations of atmospheric radiation propagation show that a single COSMOS detector is sufficient to detect the signal of a medium-strength (10\%–100\% increase above background) GLE at high statistical significance, including at fine temporal resolution. Use of fine temporal resolution would also provide a capability to detect Terrestrial Gamma Ray Flashes (via secondary neutrons) which are produced by certain lightning discharges and which can provide a hazard to aircraft, particularly in tropical regions. We also show how the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System-UK detector network could be used to provide warnings at the International Civil Aviation Organization “Moderate” and “Severe” dose rate thresholds at aviation altitudes, and how multiple-detector hubs situated at strategic UK locations could detect a small GLE at high statistical significance and infer crucial information on the nature of the primary spectrum.},

Potential applications include, but are not limited to, forecasting of weather and climate variability; prediction and monitoring of drought conditions; management and allocation of water resources; agricultural plant production and alleviation of famine; prevention of natural disasters such as wild fires, landslides, floods, and dust storms; or monitoring of ecosystem response to climate change.

Since the resolution of the images taken by the UAV is different according to the altitude, the water content estimation formula is developed by using the images taken at each altitude. In order to calibrate the color difference according to lighting conditions, the calibration method using field data were proposed. The results of the study showed an altitude-specific estimation equation using RGB values of the UAV image through linear regression. The appropriate number of field data needed for calibration for site application of the estimation equation was found between 4 and 10.

Experiment 1 compared nutrient solutions with electrical conductivities (ECns) of 6.5 dS m−1 (+SAL) and 2.4 dS m−1 (control), applied in equal volumes, following fertigation with ECns of 2.4 dS m−1 Once +SAL commenced, SWC (0–20-cm depth) increased rapidly and then remained approximately 30\% higher than in the control.

In Exp. 2, increasing ECns from 2.1 to 5.5 dS m−1 in irrigation treatments receiving 100\% of crop evaporation (ETc) and 25\% of ETc caused SWC (0–20 cm) to respectively increase appreciably and maintain relatively constant values. Experiment 3 examined the effect of increased salinity and whether normalizing sensors with higher ECns alleviated this effect. Treatments were equal volumes of: (i) ECns of 5 dS m−1 with sensor normalization at EC of 5.2 dS m−1 (SAL-N5.2); (ii) ECns of 5 dS m−1 with normalization at EC of 1.9 dS m−1 (SAL-N1.9); and (iii) ECns of 1.9 dS m−1 with normalization at 1.9 dS m−1 (control). Previously, the three treatments were fertigated with ECns of 1.9 dS m−1 The SWC (5–15 cm) increased by approximately 10\% in both SAL-N5.2 and SAL-N1.9, and maintained relatively constant values in the control. The SMP (10 cm) was consistently very similar in the three treatments. Normalizing the CS at 5.2 or 1.9 dS m−1 had no effect on the response to salinity. In the three experiments, changes in SWC generally paralleled changes in EC of soil water (ECsw); relative increases were 4 to 7.5\% in SWC for each 1 dS m−1 increase in ECsw},

We acquired more than 150 time-lapse GPR datasets along 6-m-long horizontal crossholes at six depths. The GPR SWC distributions are distinct both horizontally and vertically for both soil types. A clear change in SWC can be observed at both sites between the surface layer ({\textgreater}0.3 m) and subsoil. Alternating patches of higher and lower SWC, probably caused by the soil heterogeneity, were observed along the horizontal SWC profiles. To investigate the changes in SWC with time, GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data were averaged for each depth and compared with changes in precipitation, treatment, and soil type. The high-temporal-resolution TDR and the large-sampling-volume GPR show similar trends in SWC for both sites, but because of the different sensing volumes, different responses were obtained due to the spatial heterogeneity. A difference in spatial variation of the crosshole GPR SWC data was detected between maize and wheat. The results for this 4-yr period indicate the potential of this novel experimental setup to monitor spatial and temporal SWC changes that can be used to study soil–plant–atmosphere interactions.},

	abstract = {Through its role in the energy and water balances at the land surface, soil moisture is a key state variable in surface hydrology and land-atmosphere interactions. Point observations of soil moisture are easy to make using established methods such as time domain reflectometry and gravimetric sampling. However, monitoring large-scale variability with these techniques is logistically and economically infeasible. Here passive soil distributed temperature sensing (DTS) will be introduced as an experimental method of measuring soil moisture on the basis of DTS. Several fiber-optic cables in a vertical profile are used as thermal sensors, measuring propagation of temperature changes due to the diurnal cycle. Current technology allows these cables to be in excess of 10 km in length, and DTS equipment allows measurement of temperatures every 1 m. The passive soil DTS concept is based on the fact that soil moisture influences soil thermal properties. Therefore, observing temperature dynamics can yield information on changes in soil moisture content. Results from this preliminary study demonstrate that passive soil DTS can detect changes in thermal properties. Deriving soil moisture is complicated by the uncertainty and nonuniqueness in the relationship between thermal conductivity and soil moisture. A numerical simulation indicates that the accuracy could be improved if the depth of the cables was known with greater certainty.},

However, most of them are performed with the constraint of the dry edge of the Ts − VI space to define the maximum water stressed conditions. In view of the subjectivity and uncertainty involved in the determination of the dry edge, a new index termed as the Modified Temperature-Vegetation Dryness Index (MTVDI) was developed in this paper to reduce the reliance of the parameterization scheme on the dry edge. In the parameterization scheme of MTVDI, isopleth lines of soil moisture involved in the feature space were retrieved by the temperature-vegetation index method, and only the maximum surface temperature of bare soil (Tsmax) was indispensable in the definition of maximum water stressed conditions. For evaluation purpose, the MTVDI was demonstrated in the Southern Great Plains region of the U.S. and was compared with two other traditional soil moisture indexes developed under the constraint of dry edge. The comparison confirmed the effectivity of the MTVDI in monitoring the spatial pattern and seasonal variation of soil moisture. Our analyses also suggest that Tsmax, the only parameter needed in the definition of maximum water stressed conditions, can be retrieved directly from the parameterization scheme itself. Therefore, the retrieval of MTVDI can be performed independent of the dry edge, which is a significant improvement to the traditional parameterization schemes of soil moisture from the Ts − VI feature space.},

TDR measures the soil composite dielectric constant (Ka); thus any factor that has an influence on Ka measurement can affect soil moisture determination. On the basis of known dielectric constants of air, soil, water, and ice, as well as the volumetric fraction of each phase in a bulk soil, functional relationships between volumetric water content (θυ, cm3/cm−3) and Ka are derived in the form of θv=aKa0.5+b. In general, the TDR functions derived from this study are in good agreement with the “universal equation” developed through experiments by Topp et al. [1980] and other available TDR calibration data. This paper demonstrates that (1) soil solid and porosity have little effect on dielectric constant measurement; (2) temperature has a minor influence except for very wet soils; and (3) surface area is an important factor affecting the water content measurement.},

Soil moisture is a major ecological driver of desert locust populations but is still missing in the current imagery toolkit for preventive management. By means of statistical analyses, combining field observations of locust presence/absence and soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution from a disaggregation algorithm, we assess the potential of soil moisture to help preventive management of desert locust. We observe that a soil moisture dynamics increase of above 0.09 cm3/cm3 for 20 days followed by a decrease of soil moisture may increase the chance to observe locusts 70 days later. We estimate the gains in early warning timing compared to using imagery from vegetation to be 3 weeks. We demonstrate that forecasting errors may be reduced by the combination of several types of indicators such as soil moisture and vegetation index in a common statistical model forecasting locust presence. Policy implications. Soil moisture estimates at 1 km resolution should be used to plan desert locust surveys in preventive management. When soil moisture increases in a dry area of potential habitat for the desert locust, field surveys should be conducted two months later to evaluate the need of further preventive actions. Remote sensing estimates of soil moisture could also be used for other applications of integrated pest management.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an essential climate variable influencing land–atmosphere interactions, an essential hydrologic variable impacting rainfall–runoff processes, an essential ecological variable regulating net ecosystem exchange, and an essential agricultural variable constraining food security. Large-scale soil moisture monitoring has advanced in recent years, creating opportunities to transform scientific understanding of soil moisture and related processes. These advances are being driven by researchers from a broad range of disciplines, but this complicates collaboration and communication; and, for some applications, the science required to utilize large-scale soil moisture data is poorly developed. In this review, we describe the state of the art in large-scale soil moisture monitoring and identify some critical needs for research to optimize the use of increasingly available soil moisture data. We review representative examples of (i) emerging in situ and proximal sensing techniques, (ii) dedicated soil moisture remote sensing missions, (iii) soil moisture monitoring networks, and (iv) applications of large-scale soil moisture measurements. Significant near-term progress seems possible in the use of large-scale soil moisture data for drought monitoring. Assimilation of soil moisture data for meteorological or hydrologic forecasting also shows promise, but significant challenges related to spatial variability and model structures remain. Little progress has been made in the use of large-scale soil moisture observations within the context of ecological or agricultural modeling. Opportunities abound to advance the science and practice of large-scale soil moisture monitoring for the sake of improved Earth system monitoring, modeling, and forecasting.},

The selective and sensitive assay is based on recording change in current signal of a positively charged redox probe, hexammineruthenium(III)chloride in the absence and presence of K+ ion in solution. The sensing interface is highly stable and reproducible for detection of K+ ion a under a wide range of concentration 1 to 500 ppm. The detection sensitivity over a wide concentration range was achieved by altering the concentration of redox species. Mechanistically, the recognition properties of 4-aminobenzo-18-Crown-6 covalently bound to the Nafion on carbon surface was found to be selective for potassium ion over sodium, ammonium and calcium ion. Potassium recognition through host-guest binding of crown ether derivative and proposed simplicity of fabrication protocol makes the systems highly promising for real-time applications in soil analysis.},

In this study, by inverting the soil-water balance equation, a simple analytical relationship for estimating rainfall accumulations from the knowledge of SM time series is obtained. In situ and satellite SM observations from three different sites in Italy, Spain, and France are used to test the reliability of the proposed approach in contrasting climatic conditions. The results show that the model is able to satisfactorily reproduce daily rainfall data when in situ SM observations are employed (correlation coefficient, R, nearly equal to 0.9). Furthermore, also by using satellite data reasonable results are obtained in reproducing 4 day rainfall accumulations with R-values close to 0.8. Based on these preliminary results, the proposed approach can be adopted conveniently to improve rainfall estimation at a catchment scale and as a supplementary source of data to estimate rainfall at a global scale.},

The Biogeosystem Technique (BGT*) priming action system was developed for soil management to provide a higher-level priming effect. The BGT* is focused on a soil biogeochemical cycle activation similar to the biodegradation in a colon of a live organism as an efficient benchmark bioreactor. Fluorescence in situ hybridization showed a cooperation of bacteria within polymicrobial biofilms and a probability of the polymicrobial biofilms biodegradation process acceleration and soil organic matter (SOM) regime improvement. The soil priming actions the BGT* technological management is capable of providing are based on the BGT* constituents, whose essence, applications and corresponding detailed data are presented in available studies. The main BGT* components are as follows. The illuvial horizon intra-soil milling artificial soil aggregation (a form of crumbling and mixing) priming action provides the soil structuring, a SOM content increase and an annual yield increment direct priming effects. A long-term secondary priming effect is a technology life cycle with higher profitability compared to the standard moldboard, chiseling and three-tier plowing. The intra-soil pulse sequential-discrete watering priming action is performed through water injection into the soil in sequence. A next water spreading provides the soil aggregate stability, the seedling length and weight increment direct priming effect and a water-saving secondary priming effect. The intra-soil dispersed liquid, paste-like and loose granular nutrition and structuring matter intra-soil milling application priming action ensures soil structuring direct priming effects, heavy metals passivation and long-term yield increment secondary priming effects.

	abstract = {Abstract The field deployment of a heated distributed temperature sensor (DTS) for over three years has revealed two obstacles to estimating soil moisture (θ) that may hamper subsurface DTS applications as well as use of other subsurface thermal probes. The first observed obstacle was a hysteretic response of the DTS sensor. The relationship between θ and the temperature response (∆T) within the cable was not only dependent on θ of the soil, but also on the previous wetting and drying cycles leading to that state. The second observed obstacle was soil structure healing. Soil structure healing causes the relationship between ∆T and θ to evolve through time; this calibration curve becomes flatter, or less sensitive, as the surrounding soil makes better contact with the cable. Effects of the hysteretic response of the instrument and soil structure healing are largely the result of small gaps between the cable and soil. These small gaps can be approximated by a contact resistance between the cable and soil. In this article we characterize the occurrence of hysteretic and soil structure healing effects from field data and parameterize contact resistance by simulating heat transfer using a numerical modelling approach Copyright © 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas We propose VSHC for calculating soil water percolation in continuous models. VSHC relates permeability to daily hydraulic properties to estimate hydraulic conductivity. VSHC performed well at field scale and improved estimates of peak streamflows. Soil water percolation is a key process in the life cycle of water in fields, watersheds, and river basins. The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) and the Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender (APEX) are continuous models developed for evaluating the environmental effects of agricultural management. Traditionally, these models have simulated soil water percolation processes using a tipping-bucket approach, with the rate of flow limited by the saturated hydraulic conductivity. This simple approach often leads to inaccuracy in simulating elevated soil water conditions where soil water content (SWC) levels may remain above field capacity under prolonged wet weather periods or limited drainage. To overcome this deficiency, a new submodel, the variable saturation hydraulic conductivity (VSHC) method, was developed for simulating soil water percolation processes using a nonlinear equation to estimate the effective hydraulic conductivity as a function of the SWC and soil properties. The VSHC method was evaluated at three sites in the United States and two sites in Europe. In addition, a numerical solution of the Richards equation was used as a benchmark for SWC comparison. Results show that the VSHC method substantially improves the accuracy of the SWC simulation in long-term simulations, particularly during wet periods. At the watershed scale, results on the Riesel Y2 watershed indicate that the VSHC method enhances model performance in the high-flow regime of channel peak flows because of the improved estimation of SWC, which implies that the improved SWC simulation at the field scale is beneficial to hydrologic modeling at the watershed scale.},

Terrain attributes identified topographic functional units as management zones. Level of soil nutrients in topographic functional units were different. Topography plays a crucial role in spatial distribution of nutrients in soils; however, studies to quantify topographic influence on soil nutrient distribution from a silvopasture system are mostly lacking. To address this question, a 4.3-ha silvopasture site in northwest Arkansas was selected and a total of 51 topsoil (0–15 cm thickness) samples were collected and analyzed for primary (total N [TN], P, K), secondary (Ca, Mg, S), and micronutrients (Fe, Zn, Cu, Mn, B, Na). Topographic information was acquired from 12 terrain attributes derived from a 1-m digital elevation model. The prediction model was based on random forest. Results showed TN, S, and P were best predicted, whereas Cu, Ca, and Mn had the lowest prediction performance. Levels of S, Ca, Zn, Fe, and TN increased with SAGA wetness index, valley depth, flow accumulation, and multi-resolution valley bottom flatness index. Normalized height and slope height were positively related to Na but negatively to B and Cu distribution. Aspect had a positive influence on P and Mg concentrations. Based on terrain attributes, the study site could be divided into four topographic functional units (TFU), namely A, B, C, and D; TFU A had the highest nutrients present, whereas TFU B had the lowest P, K, Zn, Cu, Fe, and Ca but highest Na content. However, Mn, Mg, and B did not vary among TFUs. This study affirmed topographic influences on soil nutrient distribution, and the resulting continuous soil nutrient maps are useful for fine-tuning production systems through optimum nutrient and pasture management.},

The workshop includes basic concepts related to hardware (Time domain reflectometry [TDR] probe, Arduino UNO, and Water flow measurement) and software (LabVIEW and Android studio programming platforms) followed by project implementation in a group of 5–6 students. Satisfaction and comprehension were found to increase significantly for subjects (electronics and optics) to students of civil engineering background. The adopted tools represent economical means for application in conventional classrooms as well as laboratories for undergraduate students with a civil engineering background. This integration of the digital and physical world is an attempt at approaching soil mechanics mathematics from technology and arts from a scientific perspective. The examples presented in this study can be useful for developing open-source laboratories within the framework of the undergraduate curriculum in civil engineering.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Evaporative drying of soil columns was monitored in high resolution using NMR. Soil moisture data were used for validating a water, vapor, and heat flow model. The Richards approach was insufficient under Stage II conditions. NMR is a feasible technique for soil moisture measurements under Stage II conditions. Evaporation from bare soil surfaces can be restrained to a great extent with the development of a dry layer at the soil surface where capillary hydraulic conductance ceases and water flow proceeds only by gas phase transport. Model calculations and preliminary experiments with model porous media have shown that this surface layer can be very thin. An accurate characterization of these processes is required, which is provided by noninvasive magnetic resonance (MR) methods. The evaporative drying of a silt loam and a sandy loam was monitored at high spatial resolution in laboratory experiments. The MR data were used to assess the performance of two numerical models: (i) the Richards equation, which considers isothermal liquid water flow, and (ii) a coupled soil water, heat, and vapor flow numerical model. The experimental results reveal two distinct drying regimes for both soil types where, at the onset of the second evaporation stage, a dry surface zone developed with increasing thickness over time. This layer revealed that water loss inside the soil coincided with a relatively low evaporation rate as the liquid continuity to the soil surface vanished. The modeling results clearly demonstrated the need to consider heat and vapor flow. It was shown, as a proof of principle, that MR relaxation time spectra may serve as a proxy to follow desaturation processes where spatially resolved transverse relaxation can reveal a secondary evaporation front.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas A TDR array has been developed for soil moisture profiling. The sensor provides eight incremental measurements at centimeter-depth resolution. Permittivity, evaporation rate, and soil moisture profile were determined. Near-surface soil conditions (i.e., moisture and temperature) moderate mass and energy exchange at the soil–atmosphere interface. While remote sensing offers an effective means for mapping near-surface moisture content across large areas, in situ measurements, targeting those specific remotely sensed soil depths, are poorly understood and high-resolution near-surface measurement capabilities are lacking. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established, accurate measurement method for soil dielectric permittivity and moisture content. A TDR array was designed to provide centimeter-resolution measurements of near-surface soil moisture. The array consists of nine stainless steel TDR rods spaced 1 cm apart, acting as waveguide pairs to form eight two-rod TDR probes in series. A critical aspect of the design was matching the spacing of the coaxial cable–TDR rod transition to avoid unwanted reflections in the waveforms. The accuracy of the TDR array permittivity measurement (±1 permittivity unit) was similar to that of conventional TDR as verified in dielectric liquids. Electric field numerical simulations showed minimal influence of adjacent rods during a given rod-pair measurement. The evaporation rate determined by the TDR array compared well with mass balance data in a laboratory test. Near-surface soil moisture profile dynamics were monitored at centimeter-depth resolution using the TDR array in a field experiment where volumetric moisture content estimates (0–8 cm) were within 2\% of conventional three-rod TDR probes averaging across 0 to 8 cm and from 1- to 3-cm depths.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently, soil dielectric constant detection has been used in the irrigation of vastly differing farming conditions. Soil monitoring has seen a push toward fifth generation (5G) telecommunications technology, due to the higher speed and bandwidth required to connect a huge number of sensor nodes simultaneously. A novel architecture for a fully integrated, unequal arms dipole antenna is presented in this article. The proposed on-chip antenna is implemented using UMC180 nm CMOS technology. A dipole radiator is added on the upper metal layer, a ground sheet set at the lower metal layer and a patch layer is added on the intermediate metal layer. This configuration has improved the antenna impedance bandwidth by 38\%. In addition, it increased the electrical length of the dipole antenna to reduce the antenna resonant frequency by 10 GHz. The proposed antenna has a total area 1300 × 250 μm, and its wide bandwidth extends from 21 to 40 GHz at reflection coefficient {\textbar}S11{\textbar} {\textless} –7 dB, which makes it suitable for on-chip wireless sensor network applications in 5G technology. All Simulations are completed by using the Ansys HFSS (high-frequency structure simulator) ver.15 and the simulated results show a good comparison with measurements. To investigate the proposed antenna's performance in different environmental conditions, practical measurements for soil dielectric constant in different compositions with variable moisture ratios are applied. The resulting values are used in antenna simulation and have ultimately proved the antenna's improved capability to sense soil moisture in different conditions.},

(2005) pointed out several inconsistencies in the soil moisture accounting (SMA) procedure used in the SCS-CN method and developed a procedure that is more consistent from the SMA viewpoint. However, the model proposed by them does not have any expression for initial soil moisture store level (V0) and hence there is a scope for further improvement. Like the original method, there is sudden jump in V0 and therefore a quantum jump in computed runoff is possible. In the present study, an attempt is made to develop an expression for V0 to make the model a continuous watershed model. Then, the performance of the new model is compared with the model proposed by Michel et al. and the original SCS-CN model by applying them in a large number of small watersheds in the United States. The present model was found to perform significantly better than both the original SCS-CN model and the model proposed by Michel et al. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become a promising method for soil water content (SWC) monitoring. Stationary CRNS offers hectare-scale average SWC measurements at fixed locations maintenance-free and continuous in time, while car-borne CRNS roving can reveal spatial SWC patterns at medium scales, but only on certain survey days. The novel concept of a permanent mobile CRNS system on rails promises to combine the advantages of both methods, while its technical implementation, data processing and interpretation raised a new level of complexity. This study introduced a fully automatic CRNS rail-borne system as the first of its kind, installed within the locomotive of a cargo train. Data recorded from September 2021 to July 2022 along an ∼9 km railway segment were analyzed, as repeatedly used by the train, supported by local SWC measurements (soil samples and dielectric methods), car-borne and stationary CRNS. The results revealed consistent spatial SWC patterns and temporary variation along the track at a daily resolution. The observed variability was mostly related to surface features, seasonal dynamics and different responses of the railway segments to wetting and drying periods, while some variations were related to measurement uncertainties. The achieved medium scale of SWC mapping could support large scale hydrological modeling and detection of environmental risks, such as droughts and wildfires. Hence, rail-borne CRNS has the chance to become a central tool of continuous SWC monitoring for larger scales (≤10-km), with the additional benefit of providing root-zone soil moisture, potentially even in sub-daily resolution.},

	abstract = {Summary This paper presents a multi-sensor remote sensing study of physically crusted soil with various moisture contents by using millimetre-wave backscatter radiation. The backscattered radiation was used to generate an empirical model to estimate soil moisture at the thin surface crust scale by using a set of soils with known moisture content as a reference. The model was then used to assess the moisture content of a new set of soils from the same group. Real-time measurement of soil moisture in the top layer beneath the soil crust is impractical at best and impossible using traditional methods. The proposed method, therefore, paves the way to assessing soil moisture content immediately beneath the surface crust as well as in a micro-profile at depths of 0–3 cm. It can be combined with other active and passive remote sensing methods to provide a micro-profile measurement of soil moisture to the depth of the entire upper root zone (0–30 cm) and of the plough layer (0–20 cm) under undisturbed conditions. The method is based on the emerging technology of millimetre waves, which provide improved spatial resolution of the subsurface concurrent with surface mapping. Further development and use of the method described herein will make it simple and practical to analyse and understand the processes governing the soil–water interface. The major processes for which this information is important are soil crusting, water budgets (infiltration, runoff and evaporation) and soil erosion.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Early-time analysis extends the use of GPR to attenuating, clay-rich soils. Early-time GPR can upscale point measurements of water content when calibrated. Ongoing work studies alternative statistics to represent the early-time signal. We used a recent ground-penetrating radar (GPR) methodology, early-time amplitude analysis, with the goal of monitoring changes in soil water content (SWC) in response to irrigation in clayey soils. We hypothesized that early-time analysis could be used to monitor changes in SWC in clay-rich soil where ground wave and reflection-based GPR methods traditionally fail. An overnight irrigation experiment was performed in a 20- by 14-m section of natural grassland at the Samford Ecological Research Facility in southeastern Queensland, Australia. Both GPR reflection surveys and ground wave velocity analysis were ineffective at the site due to the signal attenuation associated with the clay-rich soil. We collected daily GPR and time-domain reflectometry (TDR) data sets during a 5-d period in August 2014, with soil samples collected for gravimetric analysis at the conclusion of data collection. The GPR data display a clear response of the early-time signal amplitude to changes in SWC. The GPR data sets exhibit a strong correlation with SWC, as measured by TDR and gravimetric analysis of soil cores, which is consistent with the dependence of GPR early-time amplitude on relative permittivity. The results suggest that the early-time method can be used to obtain spatially distributed information on subsurface moisture content in clay-rich soils.},

The multispectral remote sensing-based empirical models were employed on Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus and Operational Land Imager imageries to estimate the rate of soil moisture stress and salinity from 2001–2015.

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important hydrologic state variable critical to successful hydroclimatic and environmental predictions. Soil moisture varies both in space and time because of spatio-temporal variations in precipitation, soil properties, topographic features, and vegetation characteristics. In recent years, air- and space-borne remote sensing campaigns have successfully demonstrated the use of passive microwave remote sensing to map soil moisture status near the soil surface (≈0–0.05 m below the ground) at various spatial scales. In this study root zone (e.g., ≈0–0.6 m below the ground) soil moisture distributions were estimated across the Little Washita watershed (Oklahoma) by assimilating near-surface soil moisture data from remote sensing measurements using the Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) with an ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique coupled with a numerical one-dimensional vadose zone flow model (HYDRUS-ET). The resulting distributed root zone soil moisture assessment tool (SMAT) is based on the concept of having parallel noninteracting streamtubes (hydrologic units) within a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The simulated soil moisture distribution at various depths and locations within the watershed were compared with measured profile soil moisture data using time domain reflectometry (TDR). A reasonable agreement was found under favorable conditions between footprint-scale model estimations and point-scale field soil moisture measurements in the root zone. However, uncertainties introduced by precipitation and soil hydraulic properties caused suboptimal performance of the integrated model. The SMAT holds great promise and offers flexibility to incorporate various data assimilation techniques, scaling, and other hydrological complexities across large landscapes. The integrated model can be useful for simulating profile soil moisture estimation and for predicting transient soil moisture behavior for a range of hydrological and environmental applications.},

	abstract = {Abstract Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a promising method for the continuous monitoring of soil water content (θv) at the hectometre scale. However, few studies have validated its applicability within the complex terrains of various ecosystems in semiarid loess regions. In this study, CRNS-based θv was measured on China's Loess Plateau under two managed ecosystems (Caragana korshinskii K. shrubland [KOS] and Medicago sativa L. grassland [SAG]). The accuracy of CRNS measurement was assessed with the traditional oven-drying method, while its sensitivity to θv variation during the study period was compared with typical point-scale monitoring sensors (EC-5, Decagon Devices, Inc.). CRNS was found to be strongly correlated with the oven-drying based θv under both ecosystems, with coefficients of determination (R2) of 0.99 and 0.93, and root mean square errors of 0.006 and 0.007 cm3/cm3, for KOS and SAG, respectively. The mean monitoring radius of the CRNS was approximately 204 and 231 m for KOS and SAG, with a mean measurement depth of approximately 39 and 45 cm, respectively. Moreover, the θv determined by the CRNS and EC-5 sensors exhibited similar trends during the observation period, excluding that for April. However, the CRNS-based θv had a higher spatial representation for both managed ecosystems compared with that for EC-5. No significant difference was detected in the response range of θv to precipitation between the CRNS and EC-5 sensors at a depth of 0–10 cm, whereas the response time of CRNS for KOS was much shorter than that of EC-5 sensors (p {\textless} 0.01). Overall, the CRNS measured hectometre-scale θv had acceptable accuracy and sensitively traced the precipitation response under different ecosystems with high θv heterogeneity in the semiarid loess regions. Highlights CRNS accurately estimates hectometre-scale θv in ecosystems with complex terrains. The CRNS monitoring radius is 218 m with 42 cm measurement depth in the loess region. The θv in the managed shrubland is higher than that of the managed grassland. CRNS has a higher sensitivity in response to precipitation than EC-5 sensors.},

	abstract = {Abstract Large-scale measurements of the spatial distribution of water content in soils and snow are challenging for state-of-the-art hydrogeophysical methods. Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) is a noninvasive technology that has the potential to bridge the scale gap between conventional in situ sensors and remote sensing products in both, horizontal and vertical domains. In this study, we explore the feasibility and potential of estimating water content in soils and snow with neutron detectors in moving trains. Theoretical considerations quantify the stochastic measurement uncertainty as a function of water content, altitude, resolution, and detector efficiency. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the sensitivity of measured water content is almost unperturbed by train materials. Finally, three distinct real-world experiments provide a proof of concept on short and long-range tracks. With our results a transregional observational soil moisture product becomes a realistic vision within the next years.},

	abstract = {Between 2009 and 2011, the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) was augmented with soil moisture/soil temperature probes and atmospheric relative humidity instruments as part of a programmatic expansion in support of the National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS). The 114 sites in this sparse network are well distributed across the conterminous United States in open, rural locations expected to remain unchanged in land use for many decades into the future. Soil probes are installed in triplicate redundancy, similar to the air temperature and precipitation measurements, at either five standard World Meteorological Organization (WMO) depths (5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 cm) or only two depths (5 and 10 cm) depending on the nature of the underlying materials. Stations also measure air temperature, surface skin temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, and 1.5-m wind speed. In addition to sensor failure, the triplicate design of USCRN soil probes have allowed for an initial characterization of variability of soil moisture measurements. Nationwide analysis of soil moisture during early-to-mid growing season in 2011 and 2012 was performed to examine the differences in response to the widespread drought of 2012. The redundancy of the network helps retain the continuity of the record over time, and also provides key insights into the variations of measurements at a single location that are related to a combination of installation effects and the impacts of soil differences at the local level. This article highlights the usefulness of deploying triplicate configurations of soil probes for detecting faulty sensors and for better understanding the nature of soil moisture measurement variability.},

	abstract = {From Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo to increasing corn yields in Kansas to greenhouse gas flux in the Arctic, the importance of soil moisture is endemic to world affairs and merits the considerable attention it receives from the scientific community. This importance can hardly be overstated, though it often goes unstated. Soil moisture is one of the key variables in a variety of broad areas critical to the conduct of societies' economic and political affairs and their well-being; these include the health of agricultural crops, global climate dynamics, military trafficability planning, and hazards such as flooding and forest fires. Unfortunately the in situ measurement of the spatial distribution of soil moisture on a watershed-scale is practically impossible. And despite decades of international effort, a satellite remote sensing technique that can reliably measure soil moisture with a spatial resolution of meters has not yet been identified or implemented. Due to the lack of suitable measurement techniques and, until recently digital elevation models (DEMs), our ability to understand and predict soil moisture dynamics through modeling has largely remained crippled from birth [Grayson and Bloschl, 200l].},

	abstract = {At the watershed scale, soil moisture is the major control for rainfall–runoff response, especially where saturation excess runoff processes dominate. From the ecological point of view, the pools of soil moisture are fundamental ecosystem resources providing the transpirable water for plants. In drylands particularly, soil moisture is one of the major controls on the structure, function, and diversity in ecosystems. In terms of the global hydrological cycle, the overall quantity of soil moisture is small, ∼0.05\%; however, its importance to the global energy balance and the distribution of precipitation far outweighs its physical amount. In soils it governs microbial activity that affects important biogeochemical processes such as nitrification and CO2 production via respiration. During the past 20 years, technology has advanced considerably, with the development of different electrical sensors for determining soil moisture at a point. However, modeling of watersheds requires areal averages. As a result, point measurements and modeling grid cell data requirements are generally incommensurate. We review advances in sensor technology, particularly emerging geophysical methods and distributed sensors, aimed at bridging this gap. We consider some of the data analysis methods for upscaling from a point to give an areal average. Finally, we conclude by offering a vision for future research, listing many of the current scientific and technical challenges.},

Traditionally, the analysis of this relationship is restricted by the spatial coverage of both soil moisture and precipitation data that are collected through in-situ observations at limited locations. In this study, we utilized the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)’s remote sensing products of soil moisture (SMAP: Soil Moisture Active Passive) and precipitation (TRMM: Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission), which provide near-global coverage, to investigate the co-variation of precipitation and soil moisture regionally, as a function of ecosystem types and climate regimes. We apply information on land cover and climate regimes to provide insight about correlation strength of soil moisture and precipitation. The results indicate that most of the globe has a moderate to strong positive correlation of SMAP soil moisture and TRMM precipitation data during the study period. In relation to land cover, soil moisture and precipitation have the strongest correlations in regions of limited vegetation, whereas forests and densely vegetated regions have weaker correlations. As for climate regimes, they have the strongest correlations in arid or cold regions, and weaker correlations in humid, temperate locations. While remotely sensed soil moisture data are less reliable in dense vegetation, these results confirm that drier, less vegetated climates show a highly linear relationship between soil moisture and rainfall.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas In situ soil moisture data were used to develop agricultural-drought indices. Promising indices were directly linked to drought impacts (i.e., lower crop yield). Preferred indices, formulated as anomalies, were comparable across time and space. These can be derived from in situ soil moisture data common to networks worldwide. Our methodology is transferrable to other regions with in situ soil moisture data. ABSTRACT Agricultural drought is characterized by low soil moisture levels that negatively affect agricultural production, but in situ soil moisture measurements are largely absent from indices commonly used to describe agricultural drought. Instead, many indices incorporate weather-derived soil moisture estimates, which is necessary, in part, because the relationships between in situ soil moisture and agricultural-drought impacts are not well quantified. Our objective was to use in situ soil moisture data from monitoring networks in Oklahoma and West Texas to identify a soil moisture-based agricultural drought index that is (i) strongly related to crop-yield anomaly across networks, (ii) comparable across time and space, and (iii) readily understandable. Candidate indices included soil matric potential (MP), soil water storage (SWS), and fraction of available water capacity (FAW), with indices assessed in their raw form and after climatological (i.e., anomalies) or statistical standardization. At the county level, indices related similarly to crop-yield anomaly, with soil moisture-yield anomaly correlation coefficients averaging 0.63, 0.76, and 0.76 for winter wheat, hay, and cotton, respectively. However, standardization was essential to maximize temporal and spatial comparability, and at the regional level, standardized indices were more highly correlated with crop-yield anomaly than non-standardized indices. Our findings show that existing in situ soil moisture datasets can underpin regional drought-monitoring systems. The SWS-anomaly may be the preferred index because it is comparable across space and time, has units that are readily understandable (e.g., mm or inches), and can be broadly applied using data from the many in situ soil-moisture monitoring networks across the world.},

	abstract = {Abstract A multi-scale soil moisture monitoring strategy for California was designed to inform water resource management. The proposed workflow classifies soil moisture response units (SMRUs) using publicly available datasets that represent soil, vegetation, climate, and hydrology variables, which control soil water storage. The SMRUs were classified, using principal component analysis and unsupervised K-means clustering within a geographic information system, and validated, using summary statistics derived from measured soil moisture time series. Validation stations, located in the Sierra Nevada, include transect of sites that cross the rain-to-snow transition and a cluster of sites located at similar elevations in a snow-dominated watershed. The SMRUs capture unique responses to varying climate conditions characterized by statistical measures of central tendency, dispersion, and extremes. A topographic position index and landform classification is the final step in the workflow to guide the optimal placement of soil moisture sensors at the local-scale. The proposed workflow is highly flexible and can be implemented over a range of spatial scales and input datasets can be customized. Our approach captures a range of soil moisture responses to climate across California and can be used to design and optimize soil moisture monitoring strategies to support runoff forecasts for water supply management or to assess landscape conditions for forest and rangeland management.},

Our objectives were to calibrate and validate a COSMOS rover for mapping 0- to 5-cm soil moisture at spatial scales suitable for evaluating satellite-based soil moisture estimates. Region-specific calibrations for the COSMOS rover were developed using field-average soil moisture measured using impedance probes and the oven-drying method on volumetric samples. The resulting calibrations were applied to map soil moisture on two dates in a 16- by 10-km region around the Marena, Oklahoma, In Situ Sensor Testbed (MOISST) in north central Oklahoma and one date in a 34- by 14-km region in the Little Washita River watershed in southwestern Oklahoma. The mapped soil moisture patterns were consistent with the regional spatial variability in surface soil texture and with soil wetting by an intervening rainfall. The rover measured field-average soil moisture with a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 0.03 cm3 cm−3 relative to impedance probes. Likewise, the regional-average 0- to 5-cm soil moisture determined by the rover was within ±0.03 cm3 cm−3 of the best available independent estimates for each region. These results demonstrate that a COSMOS rover can be used effectively for 0- to 5-cm soil moisture mapping and for determining the average soil moisture at spatial scales suitable for satellite calibration and validation.},

To improve soil moisture estimates under a wide range of climate regimes, this study developed a nonlinear enhanced soil moisture downscaling model and evaluated it at a typical microwave resolution over the contiguous China. The enhanced model clearly outperforms the conventional approach in estimating surface soil moisture by reducing the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) from 0.175 vol/vol to 0.075 vol/vol under wet climate. Finally, soil moisture downscaling is conducted by applying such models (built at the 25-km scale) at a finer (1-km) resolution.

Five sets of experiments using different soil moisture initializations were conducted from May 1 to October 1 in 2015–2017. The model forecast for each set of experiments consists of five ensemble members. The simulation using North American Regional Reanalysis is the control run (WRF-Ctrl). Four sets of sensitivity experiments were conducted with extremely wet (WRF-Wet) and dry (WRF-dry) initial conditions and using different soil moisture products from the Global Land Data Assimilation System (WRF-GLDAS) and NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive L4 (WRF-SMAP). Results show that the WRF model can capture the key features of the NAMS, but it exhibits a wet bias in the higher elevation regions and a dry bias in the lower elevation regions. Our analysis of extremely wet and dry cases reveals that initial soil moisture conditions can affect precipitation through both modulating surface energy partitioning and influencing large-scale pressure and wind patterns. When different soil moisture products are used to initialize the model, it can lead to substantial changes in spatial pattern of the NAM precipitation. Initializing the model with SMAP and GLDAS can reduce the overestimation of precipitation over high terrain areas. The results indicate that high-quality soil moisture products have the potential to improve model representation of the NAMS, especially with future improvements in model convective parameterization.},

This study combined the multitemporal remote sensing data of Sentinel-1 and Landsat 8 to conduct an inversion study on surface soil water content under low vegetation cover in Nagqu, central Tibetan Plateau. Four vegetation indices (NDVI, ARVI, EVI, and RVI) were extracted from optical remote sensing data. A water cloud model was used to eliminate the influence of the vegetation layer on the backscattering coefficient associated with vegetation cover, and a predictive model suitable for the Nagqu area was constructed. The water cloud model effectively incorporated a vegetation index instead of vegetation water content. We found that VV polarization was more suitable for soil water content inversion than VH polarization. Among the four vegetation indices, the soil water content inversion model constructed with RVI under VV polarization had the best fit (R2 = 0.8212; RMSE = 6.30). The second-best fit was observed for vegetation water content-NDVI (R2 = 0.8201). The soil water content inversion models all had an R2 {\textgreater} 0.6, regardless of the vegetation index used, though the RVI had the best fitting effect, indicating that this vegetation index is highly applicable in the water cloud model, as a substitute for vegetation water content, and is expected to perform well in similar study sites.},

In this study, we evaluated the effects of organic amendment history and crop rotation on potentially mineralizable N (N0), mineralizable N pools, and field estimates of soil N supply in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) production, and evaluated a suite of N availability measures to detect changes in these parameters. Preplant soil samples (top 15-cm) were collected from the potato year of a rotation trial in Maine during 2004 and 2005. Treatments included three crop rotations, with and without a history of organic amendment [solid beef (Bos taurus) manure] application: PB, potato-barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); PSPB, potato-soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]-potato-barley; and PSBA/T, potato-soybean-barley-alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.)/timothy (Phleum pratense L.). The N0 and mineralizable N pools were determined by aerobic incubation at 25°C and periodic leaching for 24 wk with a fixed-k approach. On average, historically amended soil had 35\% higher values of N0, and an 8\% higher proportion of mineralizable N partitioned to the stable mineralizable N pool, compared with nonamended soil. Lower values of N0, mineralizable N pools and some measures of N availability were measured in PSBA/T compared with PB and PSPB rotations. All tested measures of N availability detected management-induced changes in N0 and mineralizable N pools. The preplant nitrate, UV absorbance of 0.01 M NaHCO3 extract at 205 nm and particulate organic matter (POM)-N were the best predictors of field-based indices of soil N supply (r2 = 0.50 to 0.73). Management-induced changes in the size and quality of mineralizable N should be considered in developing best N management programs through organic amendment application and crop rotations.},

	abstract = {The productivity of the smallholder farming system in Ghana is under threat due to soil fertility decline. Mineral fertilizer is sparingly being used by smallholder farmers because of prohibitive cost. Grain legumes such as pigeonpea can play a complementary or alternative role as a source of organic fertilizer due to its ability to enhance soil fertility. Despite its importance, the potential of pigeonpea as a soil fertility improvement crop has not been exploited to any appreciable extent and the amount of land cultivated to pigeonpea in Ghana is vey negligible. This paper synthesizes recent studies that have been carried out on pigeonpea in Ghana and discusses the role of pigeonpea cultivation in soil fertility management and its implication for farming system sustainability. The paper shows that recent field studies conducted in both the semi-deciduous forest and the forest/savanna transitional agro-ecological zones of Ghana indicate that pigeonpea/maize rotations can increase maize yield by 75–200\%. Barrier to widespread adoption of pigeonpea include land tenure, market, and accessibility to early maturing and high yielding varieties. The paper concludes among other things that in order to promote the cultivation of pigeonpea in Ghana, there is the need to introduce varieties that combine early maturity with high yields and other desirable traits based on farmers preferences.},

	abstract = {Abstract This research investigated the spatial and temporal distribution of volumetric soil water content (VWC) and total soil water across 64 sampling locations (8 × 8 grid) in a production-scale field, reported as a unitextural soil unit by SSURGO. Consequently, the required number and placement of soil moisture monitoring locations were calculated to represent soil water status with varying degrees of variability. Each soil layer in the root zone was subject to 5–9\% of mean spatial VWC variability and maximum variability as high as 21\% during the 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. Total soil water showed spatial behavior, which was as high as 13\%, with mean spatial variability of 5\%. In 2014, the field minimum and maximum temporal CVs in VWC were 9 and 27\%, respectively, which increased to 14 and 33\% in 2015, respectively. Representative soil moisture and its variability were accounted for using 1–45 monitoring locations, depending on observed variability, acceptable measurement error, and confidence interval (CI). When the commonly used marginal error of 2\% was considered, the numbers of sensor deployment locations were 8 (90\% CI) and 11 (95\% CI), which reduced to 5 (90\% CI) and 4 (95\% CI) sensors with 3\% marginal error. We demonstrate that although SSURGO data can be valuable to make preliminary assessments, relying on it to spatially characterize soil units and their properties for effective within-soil unit management, especially for variable rate water and nutrient applications, can create significant challenges.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Depth to claypan, landscape position, and cropping system influence soil fertility and nutrient buffering. Accounting for landscape-variable depth to claypan could improve P and K management. Cover crops can help increase soil organic matter content. Cover crops may help reduce P requirements on claypan soils. Precise nutrient management across claypan soil landscapes requires an understanding of how diversity in management practices impacts soil properties and nutrient buffering. Therefore, a study was performed at the Central Mississippi River Basin site of the USDA Long-Term Agroecosystem Network from 2010 to 2016 to determine how depth to claypan (DTC), cropping system (CS), and landscape position (LP) affect soil properties, and whether accounting for these factors could improve fertility management. Treatments consisted of five CS MTCS, mulch till corn (Zea mays L.)–soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]; NTCS, no-till corn–soybean; NTCSW, no-till corn–soybean–wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–cover crop; CCRP, cool season conservation reserve program; and HAY, cool and warm-season hay and three LP (summit, backslope, and footslope), each with a distinct DTC. Soil test P (STP) was 9 kg P ha–1 greater on footslopes than summits. Soil test K (STK) and soil organic matter content (SOM) were greatest on backslopes and averaged 384 kg K ha–1 and 20 g kg–1, respectively, Soil test P was ≥49\% and STK was ≥10\% lower in NTCSW than in MTCS or NTCS. However, crop diversity in NTCSW maintained STP and increased SOM 2 g kg–1 over MTCS. Soil test P, pHs, and SOM were similar between CCRP and HAY, while STK in CCRP was greater at all LP. Lastly, deeper DTC caused greater P buffering and less K buffering than shallower DTC. These results indicate that eroded sideslopes with shallow DTC likely need more or more frequent P and less K than other LP.},

	abstract = {Abstract Machine learning combined with multisource remote sensing data to assess soil moisture content (SMC) has attracted considerable attention in SMC studies, but the retrieval results still remain uncertain. The purpose of this study is to combine multiple single machine learning models with integrated learning algorithms and propose an SMC retrieval method based on multiple differentiated models under a stacking integrated learning architecture. First, 19 factors, including: radar backscattering coefficient, vegetation index, and drought index, that affect SMC were extracted from SENTINEL-1, LANDSAT, and terrain factors. Those with the highest importance scores were selected as retrieval factors using the Boruta algorithm combined with four single machine learning methods—classified regression tree, random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme random tree. In addition, the two stacking ensemble models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and the generalized boosted regression model (GBM) were tested and applied to build the most reliable and accurate estimation model. The results showed that radar backscattering coefficient, temperature, vegetation drought index, land surface temperature, enhanced vegetation index, and solar local incident angle were the most important environmental variables for soil moisture retrieval. A comparison of the four machine learning methods in April and August showed that the GBDT model revealed the highest SMC retrieval accuracy, with root mean square error values of 1.87\% and 1.64\%, respectively. The stacking models were more accurate than the optimal single machine learning model, especially when using GBM. The multifactor integrated model constructed using spectral indices, radar backscatter coefficients, and topographic data exhibited high accuracy in soil surface moisture retrieval in an arid zone, providing a reference for land desertification studies and ecological environment management in the study region.},

Here we employed the Hydrus 2-D/3-D code to define a soil-specific calibration curve. We define a 2-D geometry of the fiber optic cable and the surrounding soil media, and simulate heat pulses to capture the soil thermal response at different soil water contents. The model was validated in an irrigated field using DTS data from two locations along the FO deployment in which reference moisture sensors were installed. Results indicate that θ was measured with the model-based calibration with accuracy better than 0.022 m3 m−3.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this new era of remote-sensing based hydrology, a major unanswered question is how to incorporate the impact of land-surface based heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics at remote sensing scales. The answer to this question is complicated since (1) soil moisture dynamics that vary with support, extent, and spacing scales are dependent on land-surface based heterogeneity and (2) land-surface based heterogeneity itself is scale-specific and varies with hydroclimates. Land-surface factors such as soil, vegetation, and topography affect soil moisture dynamics by redistributing the available soil moisture on the ground. In this study, we determined the contribution of these biophysical factors to redistribution of near-surface soil moisture across a range of remote sensing scales varying from an (airborne) remote sensor footprint (1.6 km) to a (satellite) footprint scale (25.6 km). Two-dimensional nondecimated wavelet transform was used to extract the support scale information from the spatial signals of the land-surface and soil moisture variables. The study was conducted in three hydroclimates: humid (Iowa), subhumid (Oklahoma), and semiarid (Arizona). The dominance of soil on soil moisture dynamics typically decreased from airborne to satellite footprint scales whereas the influence of topography and vegetation increased with increasing support scale for all three hydroclimates. The distinct effect of hydroclimate was identifiable in the soil attributes dominating the soil moisture dynamics. The near-surface soil moisture dynamics in Arizona (semiarid) can be attributed more to the clay content which is an effective limiting parameter for evaporation whereas in Oklahoma (humid), sand content (limiting parameter for drainage) was the dominant soil attribute. The findings from this study can provide a deeper understanding of the impact of heterogeneity on soil moisture dynamics and the potential improvement of hydrological models operating at footprints' scales.},

	abstract = {Abstract While soil moisture patterns can be interesting traits to investigate spatio-temporal heterogeneity of catchments relevant for various physical processes of soil–atmosphere interaction and soil water redistribution, many of the existing methods to capture spatial patterns are time consuming, expensive or need site-specific calibration. In this study we present a quick and inexpensive supplementary field method for classifying soil wetness in wet environments. The seven wetness classes are based on qualitative indicators, which one can touch, hear or see on the soil surface. To counter critics that such qualitative methods are considerably affected by subjectivity, we performed systematic testing of the method by taking qualitative measurements in the field with 20 non-expert raters. We then analyzed these in terms of degree of agreement and assessed the results against gravimetric sampling and time domain reflectometry measurements. In 70\% of all classifications raters agreed on the wetness class assigned to the marked sampling locations and in 95\% they were not off by more than one wetness class. The seven quantitative wetness classes agreed with gravimetric and time domain reflectometry measurements, although intermediate to wet classes showed an overlap of their range whereas the driest classes showed considerable spread. Despite some potential to optimize the method, it has been shown to be a reliable supplement to existing quantitative techniques for assessing soil moisture patterns in wet environments.

In this study, the multi-layer root zone soil moisture (0-5, 0-10, 10-40 and 40-100 cm) prediction is conducted over an agriculture dominant basin, namely the Xiang River Basin, in southern China. The support vector machines (SVM) coupled with dual ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) technique (SVM-EnKF) is compared with SVM for its potential capability to improve the efficiency of soil moisture prediction. Three remote sensing soil moisture products, namely SMAP, ASCAT and AMSR2, are evaluated for their performance in multi-layer soil moisture prediction with SVM and SVM-EnKF, respectively. Multiple cases are designed to investigate the performance of SVM, the effectiveness of coupling dual EnKF technique and the applicability of the remote sensing products in soil moisture prediction. The main results are as follows: (a) The efficiency of soil moisture prediction with SVM using meteorological variables as inputs is satisfactory for the surface layers (0-5 and 0-10 cm), while poor for the root zone layers (10-40 and 40-100 cm). Adding SMAP as input to SVM can improve its performance in soil moisture prediction, with more than 47\% increase in the R-value and at least 11\% reduction in RMSE for all layers. However, adding ASCAT or AMSR2 has no improvement for its performance. (b) Coupling dual EnKF can significantly improve the performance of SVM in the soil moisture prediction of both surface and the root zone layers. The increase in R-value is above 80\%, while the reduction in BIAS and RMSE is respectively more than 90\% and 63\%. However, adding remote sensing soil moisture products as inputs can no further improve the performance of SVM-EnKF. (c) The SVM-EnKF can eliminate the influence of remote sensing soil moisture extreme values in soil moisture prediction, therefore, improve its accuracy.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas An algorithm for predicting soil-water storage was evaluated for 6 yr. Algorithm accuracy was high during wet-up, snow cover, and early recession. Accuracy declined during late recession and during dry periods. Accuracy declined and relative independent-variable rank changed in dry years. Transient snow cover in dry periods altered soil-water storage patterns. Using 6 yr (Water Year [WY] 2009–WY 2014) of hourly in situ measurements from a spatially distributed water-balance cluster, we quantified the long-term accuracy of an algorithm used to predict spatial patterns of depth-integrated soil-water storage within the rain–snow transition zone of the southern Sierra Nevada. The algorithm—the multivariate, non-parametric regression-tree estimator Random Forest—was used to predict soil-water storage based on a combination of attributes at each instrument cluster (soil texture, topographic wetness index, elevation, northness, and canopy cover). Out-of-bag R2 (similar to cross-validation for Random Forest) was used to quantify the accuracy of the estimator for unobserved data. Accuracy was consistently high during the wet-up, snow-cover, and early recession periods of average and wet years. The accuracy declined at the end of a 3-yr dry period, and the relative rank of the independent variables in the model shifted. Soil texture was the highest-ranked independent variable across all years, followed by elevation and northness. Topographic wetness increased in importance during dry periods. Northness exhibited high importance during the wet-up and early recession periods of most water years. During dry years, the importance of elevation declined. In dry years, notable differences in soil-water storage at each depth include lower-than-average storage in the deeper regolith at the beginning of the water year and lower storage in near-surface layers during the winter resulting from transient snow cover.},

This 3-yr study evaluated stocking method effects on animal behavior and soil nutrient concentration in ‘Pensacola’ bahiagrass (Paspalum notatum Flügge) pastures. Stocking methods were continuous stocking and rotational stocking with 1-, 3-, 7-, and 21-d grazing periods and a 21-d resting period. Responses were measured in three zones based on distance from shade and water (Zone 1, 0–8 m; Zone 2, 8–16 m; Zone 3, {\textgreater}16 m). Indices were calculated to weight number of dung and urine events and time spent by cattle in a zone by the proportion of the total pasture and paddock area represented by that zone. Indices were most uniform (∼1) across zones for rotational stocking with short grazing periods and generally increased linearly in Zones 1 and 2 with increasing grazing period. Except for N, soil nutrient concentration was not affected by stocking method. In zones closest to shade and water, soil nutrients accumulated for all methods in the surface 8 cm but not in the 8- to 23-cm layer. Air temperature, wind speed, and temperature–humidity index explained 49\% of the variation in time cattle spent under shade, confirming the importance of the environment in animal behavior. In warm environments, structural features of stocking method (e.g., the position of shade and water) have a greater effect on animal behavior and distribution in the landscape than do stocking density-mediated effects on competition for forage.},

AHFO is based on distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observation of the heating and cooling of a buried fiber-optic cable resulting from an electrical impulse of energy delivered from the steel cable jacket. The results presented were collected from 750 m of cable buried in three 240 m colocated transects at 30, 60, and 90 cm depths in an agricultural field under center pivot irrigation. The calibration curve relating soil water content to the thermal response of the soil to a heat pulse of 10 W m−1 for 1 min duration was developed in the lab. This calibration was found applicable to the 30 and 60 cm depth cables, while the 90 cm depth cable illustrated the challenges presented by soil heterogeneity for this technique. This method was used to map with high resolution the variability of soil water content and fluxes induced by the nonuniformity of water application at the surface.},

	abstract = {With the goal of an effective method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors that can be implemented rapidly, the applicability of a two-point α-mixing model was examined for a variety of sensor types. A large number of sensor outputs (X) were taken for four different types of ECH2O soil moisture sensors under varying volumetric water contents (θ) using four test sands with various grain sizes. The two-point α-mixing model was fitted to the X–θ data and a fitting parameter, α, was determined for each sensor type. Two other widely used sensors, the CS616 and the ThetaProbe ML2x, were also tested using the calibration functions and data provided by the manufacturers, including data for a soil with high electrical conductivity. For the sensors tested in this study, the effects of sensor characteristics were lumped into α. The value of α was 1.0 to 4.6, generally with high r2 values. Some of these were as accurate as polynomial models that require a large number of X–θ data. After the α value is fitted for a specific sensor type, the two-point α-mixing model requires only the measurement of porosity and two extreme X values, i.e., sensor outputs in dry and saturated soils, and does not require soil samples with intermediate water content. Therefore, the two-point α-mixing model can be considered as an alternative method for calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors, especially when porosity is known with small uncertainty such as relatively homogeneous field or laboratory experiments.},

	abstract = {Soil spatial heterogeneity poses a challenge to accurate soil moisture determination. Remote sensing, in particular, using sensors that acquire data at microwave frequencies, is being used to overcome this challenge. In situ soil moisture monitoring can be used to validate remotely sensed surface soil moisture estimates and as inputs for agronomic and hydrologic models. Nine in situ soil moisture stations were established in Manitoba (Canada) and instrumented with Stevens Hydra Probes. The sensors were installed in triplicate with vertical orientation at the surface and with horizontal orientation at the 5-, 20-, 50-, and 100-cm depths. To ensure accuracy of the measured soil moisture, both laboratory and field calibrations were conducted. These calibrated soil moisture values were compared with the probe default values and those generated using published calibrations. Overall, the results showed that the field calibration was superior (coefficient of determination r2 of 0.95) to the laboratory calibration (r2 of 0.89). In addition, coarse-textured sites generally performed better than the fine-textured, high cation exchange capacity (CEC) sites. At the Kelburn site with high clay and CEC, the use of field calibration reduced the root mean square error from 0.188 to 0.026 m3 m−3. However, at the low clay and CEC Treherne site, gains in accuracy were minimal, about 0.005 m3 m−3. The laboratory calibration consistently underestimated soil moisture at all the evaluation sites, whereas both Topp and Logsdon calibrations overestimated soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Encroachment of pinyon–juniper woodland into rangeland ecosystems is prevalent across the western United States. Mechanisms associated with this successful encroachment are speculative, but probably, in part, involve the effective use of water resources. We explored the ecohydrological characteristics of a two-needle pinyon pine (Pinus edulis Engelm.)–Utah juniper [Juniperus osteosperma (Torr.) Little] woodland on the Colorado Plateau in Utah. We have discovered that a high level of natural soil water repellency or hydrophobicity exists under the canopies of both pinyon and juniper species. We found, following summer precipitation events, that soil water repellency under trees concentrated the soil water below the surface through finger flow or bypass infiltration, contrasting with piston flow and much more uniform soil wetting in intercanopy locations. We propose that the trees “engineer” their environment, creating water repellency as a way of providing an ecohydrological advantage and reducing potential water uptake by shallow-rooted herbaceous species. In addition, we speculate that soil water repellency may be a major contributing factor to the “nutrient islands” observed to persist under juniper canopies even after the trees have been cut down and removed.},

The method is based on physical equivalence of the dielectric properties between soil drying–wetting and freezing–thawing transitions. We applied this method to determine/compare (i) the VOSs of two types of fringe field probes (one tube type and one cone type) with sandy silt loam samples at a middle level of soil moisture content (θv = 0.20 cm3 cm−3), (ii) the VOSs of the cone-type probe with sandy silt loam samples at three levels (θv = 0.10, 0.20, and 0.28 cm3 cm−3), and (iii) the VOSs of the tube-type probe with three soil textural samples (sand, sandy silt loam, and silty clay). The determined radii of the cone-type sensor ranged from 3.0 to 4.1 cm and those of the tube-type sensor from 5.1 to 8.5 cm.

In this study, we investigated whether soil hydraulic properties are related to soil water content variability at the field scale. We used the mean relative difference (MRD) of soil water content and saturation degree to describe the spatial soil water content variability of a 2-yr time series of soil water content measured with a sensor network at 41 locations in the Rollesbroich catchment (Germany). Hydraulic properties were described by the van Genuchten–Mualem (VGM) model and were estimated by inverse modeling of soil water content data using the Hydrus-1D model for each location. The feasible parameter space for the inverse modeling was derived using the Rosetta pedotransfer functions from information on sand, silt, and clay contents and bulk density from 273 soil samples taken in the catchment. Our inverse modeling results were able to reproduce the observed time series of soil water content with a root mean square error {\textless}0.08 cm3 cm−3 and R2 {\textgreater} 0.75. We found that the MRDs of soil water content were positively correlated with the saturated water content (θs) and shape-fitting n parameters and negatively correlated with the shape-fitting α and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks) parameters of the VGM model. Moreover, the MRDs of the saturation degree were strongly correlated with the α and n parameters that determine the shape of the VGM model.},

	abstract = {Heat pulse probes (HPP) have been widely utilized to determine soil thermal properties and water content in unfrozen soils; however, their applications in frozen soils are largely restricted by phase change and the presence of unfrozen water. This study explores the possibility of using HPP to determine total water content of frozen soils by (1) establishing the optimum heat applications to limit melting, (2) improving the mathematical representations for frozen conditions, and (3) evaluating the applicability of HPP methods under various temperature and moisture conditions. A custom-built HPP was tested at total moisture levels that varied from full saturation to oven dry and initial soil temperatures from 20°C to −11°C. The applied heat pulse durations varied from 8 to 60 s, with total heat strength varying from 100 to 2000 J m−1. Comparison of mathematical methods involved two analytical solutions and a one-dimensional finite difference numerical model. While both analytical methods assumed no phase change, the numerical model considered ice melting and unfrozen water. Conclusions include the following: (1) the numerical model with phase change is the only appropriate method to represent the temperature change curve once melting occurs; (2) below −4°C, ice melting could be limited, and measurement errors of total moisture content were within ±0.05 m3 m−3; (3) application of HPP between −2°C and 0°C is difficult because of the retarded response of probe temperature to changing moisture contents and heat applications; and (4) probe spacing is a sensitive parameter requiring calibration once reinstallation of the probe or the thawing and freezing process occurs.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture plays a critical role in improving the weather and climate forecast and understanding terrestrial ecosystem processes. It is a key hydrologic variable in agricultural drought monitoring, flood forecasting, and irrigation management as well. Satellite retrievals can provide unprecedented soil moisture information at the global scale; however, the products are generally provided at coarse resolutions (25–50 km2). This often hampers their use in regional or local studies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission was launched in January 2015 aiming to acquire soil moisture and freeze-thaw states over the globe with 2 to 3 days revisit frequency. This work presents a new framework based on an ensemble learning method while using atmospheric and geophysical information derived from remote-sensing and ground-based observations to downscale the level 3 daily composite version (L3\_SM\_P) of SMAP radiometer soil moisture over the Continental United States at 1-km spatial resolution. In the proposed method, a suite of remotely sensed and in situ data sets are used, including soil texture and topography data among other information. The downscaled product was validated against in situ soil moisture measurements collected from two high density validation sites and 300 sparse soil moisture networks throughout the Continental United States. On average, the unbiased Root Mean Square Error between the downscaled SMAP soil moisture data and in-situ soil moisture observations adequately met the SMAP soil moisture retrieval accuracy requirement of 0.04 m3/m3. In addition, other statistical measures, that is, Pearson correlation coefficient and bias, showed satisfactory results.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT Large area integrated soil moisture measurement results are often required for meteorological studies as well as for geological, agricultural and natural disaster research. Commonly used sensors measure the soil moisture locally and exhibit a strong spatial variability due to the heterogeneity of most land surfaces. The new ‘Free Line Sensing’ technology uses existing high-voltage power lines to detect variations in soil moisture below the lines. The electromagnetic field of an additional radio-frequency signal in the range of 50–500 kHz on the line is influenced by changes in the electric properties of the soil, e.g., after rainfall. This has been simulated using high-frequency software, the result being that variations of electrical conductivity or dielectric coefficient of the soil will lead to a measurable effect with power line sections extending over several kilometres. Measurements have been conducted on a 13 km long high-voltage power line. The resulting signal is evaluated with respect to amplitude and phase. Measurement data demonstrate the capability of the ‘Free Line Sensor’ to monitor the integrated soil moisture of the Earth’s surface and near subsurface over the area covered by the power line. The resulting signal of the ‘Free Line Sensor’ strongly responds to precipitation events and the following drying of the soil. Comparison with soil moisture data obtained from gravimetric drying of soil samples reveals a good agreement.},

We use three main data sources: in situ observations, the remote-sensing-based data set of the European Space Agency Climate Change Initiative on the Essential Climate Variable soil moisture (ECV-SM), and land surface model estimates from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts's ERA-Land. The intercomparisons of the three soil moisture data sources are performed at the in situ locations as well as for the full-gridded products. The applied method allows us to quantify the spatial footprint of soil moisture. At the in situ locations it is shown that for absolute soil moisture the ECV-SM and ERA-Land products perform similarly, while for the temporal anomalies the ECV-SM product shows more similarity in spatial representativeness with the in situ data. When taking into account all grid cells of the ECV-SM and ERA-Land products to calculate spatial representativeness, we find the largest differences in spatial representativeness for the absolute values. The differences in spatial representativeness between the single products can be related to some of their intrinsic characteristics, i.e., for ECV-SM low similarities are found in topographically complex terrain and areas with dense vegetation, while for ERA-Land the smoothed model topography and surface properties affect soil moisture and its spatial representativeness. Additionally, we show that the applied method is robust and can be used to analyze existing networks to provide insight into the locations in which higher station density would be of most benefit.},

	abstract = {Abstract Host plant resources are a major issue in gall-insect ecology. Soil fertilization may affect both plant quality and indirect defenses, as well as the prey quality of herbivores for predators. The soil fertility hypothesis (SFH) claims that gall-inducing insects infest more plants growing on poor than on fertile soils. Until now this was studied and supported only by observations in natural tropical biomes. We tested its validity in a field experiment in a Mediterranean region, using four aphid species (Hemiptera: Aphididae, Eriosomatinae) that induce galls in wild Pistacia atlantica Desf. (Anacardiaceae) trees, and their main enemies. The impact of fertilization was examined in control trees that were not fertilized (‘poor soil’) and others that were fertilized with NPK for either one or two consecutive growing seasons. Average internode length in apical shoots of fertilized trees was longer than in control trees, following SFH expectations. We did not detect a different number of aphid species in each tree, contrary to SFH predictions. Fertilization lowered the number of galls, the gall survival, and the mean number of aphids inside the galls, as expected by the SFH. All the galls suffered increased attacks by enemies in fertilized trees, as expected by the SFH. In conclusion, following this field experiment, the SFH should not be rejected as a possible framework in research on galling-insect ecology.},

However, there is no dependable method to quantitatively estimate the P leaching risk of soils. In this study, a simple soil column method was developed using two calcareous Fluvisols, silt loam and loam. The soil column was 20 cm in length and 5 cm in diameter, and distilled water was continuously supplied from the top. The volume and dissolved reactive P (DRP) concentrations of leachate were measured. Results showed that DRP concentrations in leachate increased slowly for the low soil Olsen-P levels but rapidly for the high Olsen-P levels. According to these two-phase changes in the DRP versus soil Olsen-P contents, the thresholds of P leaching risk were estimated to be 41.1 and 62.3 mg P kg−1 (Olsen-P) for silt loam and loam, respectively. The P leaching intensity of soils increased by 3- to 540-fold if the soil Olsen-P contents accumulated from 6.6 to 155.5 mg P kg−1. The outcomes derived from this study regarding the determination of P leaching threshold and intensity by the soil column method also need a further verification on more soils with a wide range of physical and chemical properties.},

	abstract = {Abstract The soil water content profile is often well correlated with the soil moisture state near the surface. They share mutual information such that analysis of surface-only soil moisture is, at times and in conjunction with precipitation information, reflective of deeper soil fluxes and dynamics. This study examines the characteristic length scale, or effective depth Δz, of a simple active hydrological control volume. The volume is described only by precipitation inputs and soil water dynamics evident in surface-only soil moisture observations. To proceed, first an observation-based technique is presented to estimate the soil moisture loss function based on analysis of soil moisture dry-downs and its successive negative increments. Then, the length scale Δz is obtained via an optimization process wherein the root-mean-squared (RMS) differences between surface soil moisture observations and its predictions based on water balance are minimized. The process is entirely observation-driven. The surface soil moisture estimates are obtained from the NASA Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission and precipitation from the gauge-corrected Climate Prediction Center daily global precipitation product. The length scale Δz exhibits a clear east-west gradient across the contiguous United States (CONUS), such that large Δz depths ({\textgreater}200 mm) are estimated in wetter regions with larger mean precipitation. The median Δz across CONUS is 135 mm. The spatial variance of Δz is predominantly explained and influenced by precipitation characteristics. Soil properties, especially texture in the form of sand fraction, as well as the mean soil moisture state have a lesser influence on the length scale.},

When present in geophysical and remotely sensed fields, it implies that when classical (single-scale) remote sensing algorithms are used to determine surrogates of various geophysical fields, they can at most be correct at the unique (and subjective) calibration resolution. Scaling analysis and modeling techniques were applied to MODIS TERRA Bands 1 through 7 and to the standard derived vegetation and soil moisture indices in order to quantitatively characterize the wide range of scaling of these fields. The scaling exponents we found are not so large; however, they act across wide scale ranges and imply large effects. For example, for the statistics near the mean, the MODIS (500-m) resolution would be biased by a factor of ∼1.52 when compared with similar results from an “ideal” sensor at 1-mm resolution. Applying the standard index algorithms on lower and lower resolution satellite data, we obtained indices with significantly different statistical properties than if the same algorithm was used at the finest resolution and then degraded to an intermediate value (a difference of a factor ∼1.54). This shows that the algorithms can, at best, be accurate at the unique calibration scale and this points to the need to develop resolution-independent algorithms based on the scaling exponents.},

	abstract = {Summary We used inverse modelling techniques and soil moisture measured by the cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRS) to estimate root-zone soil hydraulic properties at the field scale. A HYDRUS-1D model was developed for inverse modelling and calibrated with parameter estimation software (PEST) using a global optimizer. Integral CRS measurements recorded from a sunflower farm in Germany comprised the model input. Data were transformed to soil water storage to enable direct model calibration with a HYDRUS soil-water balance. Effective properties at the CRS scale were compared against local measurements and other inversely estimated soil properties from independent soil moisture profiles. Moreover, CRS-scale soil properties were tested on the basis of how field soil moisture (vertical distribution) and soil water storage were reproduced. This framework provided good estimates of effective soil properties at the CRS scale. Simulated soil moisture at different depths at the CRS scale agreed with field observations. Moreover, simulated soil water storage at the CRS scale compared well with calculations from point-scale profiles, despite their different support volumes. The CRS-scale soil properties estimated with the inverse model were within the range of variation of properties identified from all inverse simulations at the local scale. This study demonstrates the potential of CRS for inverse estimation of soil hydraulic properties.},

	abstract = {Contour hedgerow intercropping systems have been proposed as an alternative to traditional agricultural practice with a single crop, as they are effective in reducing run-off and soil erosion. However, competition for water and nutrients between crops and associated hedgerows may reduce the overall performance of these systems. To get a more detailed understanding of the competition for water, spatially resolved monitoring of soil water contents in the soil-plant-atmosphere system is necessary. Electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) is potentially a valuable technique to monitor changes in soil moisture in space and time. In this study, the performance of different ERT electrode arrays to detect the soil moisture dynamics in a mono- and an intercropping system was tested. Their performance was analyzed based on a synthetic study using geophysical measures, such as data recovery and resolution, and using spatial statistics of retrieved water content, such as an adjusted coefficient of variation and semivariances. The synthetic ERT measurements detected differences between the cropping systems and retrieved spatial structure of the soil moisture distribution, but the variance and semivariance were underestimated. Sharp water content contrasts between horizons or in the neighborhood of a root water uptake bulb were smoothened. The addition of electrodes deeper in the soil improved the performance, but sometimes only marginally. ERT is therefore a valuable tool for soil moisture monitoring in the field under different cropping systems if an electrode array is used which can resolve the patterns expected to be present in the medium. The use of spatial statistics allowed to not only identify the overall model recovery, but also to quantify the recovery of spatial structures.},

	abstract = {Treated urban wastewater has been increasingly used for irrigation to increase crop production, but inadequate management of this marginal quality saline water cannot only reduce crop yield but also degrade soil. To increase sustainability, a sound irrigation policy based on real-time soil states is needed to avoid the adverse effects from excess salinity in soils. In real applications, uncertain model inputs and soil heterogeneity are expected when a modeling approach is used. In addition, sensor measurement information is generally insufficient to characterize the state of the soil profile in detail. To overcome these limitations, a monitoring and modeling system assimilating embedded sensor datastreams into a hydrologic model to improve real-time soil state estimates over the whole profile of interest is examined with a wastewater reuse system in Palmdale, CA. Experimental results show that under an unknown heterogeneous soil, the filtering scheme is able to describe the spatial variability of moisture and soil solution electrical conductivity in soils due to direct state estimation by assimilating moisture and electrical conductivity measurements and also due to improved soil hydraulic parameter estimates through the data assimilation framework. Two data withholding validation experiments were conducted to evaluate the added value of assimilating measurements. The spatial data withholding experiment demonstrates that state predictions at unobserved areas can be improved via the assimilation if the soil system is relatively homogeneous and effects from erroneous irrigation forcing are reduced. The temporal data withholding experiment indicates that a high update frequency can maintain the reliability of state estimation. Overall, this system can provide a more accurate soil characterization that could be used to optimize irrigation management to reduce adverse effects from wastewater reuse.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture plays a key role in hydrological, biogeochemical, and energy budgets of terrestrial ecosystems. Accurate soil moisture measurements in remote ecosystems such as the Amazon are difficult and limited because of logistical constraints. Time domain reflectometry (TDR) sensors are widely used to monitor soil moisture and require calibration to convert the TDR's dielectric permittivity measurement (Ka) to volumetric water content (θv). In this study, our objectives were to develop a field-based calibration of TDR sensors in an old-growth upland forest in the central Amazon, to evaluate the performance of the calibration, and then to apply the calibration to determine the dynamics of soil moisture content within a 14.2-m-deep vertical soil profile. Depth-specific TDR calibration using local soils in a controlled laboratory setting yielded a novel Ka–θv third-degree polynomial calibration. The sensors were later installed to their specific calibration depth in a 14.2-m pit. The widely used Ka–θv relationship (Topp model) underestimated the site-specific θv by 22–42\%, indicating significant error in the model when applied to these well-structured, clay-rich tropical forest soils. The calibrated wet- and dry-season θv data showed a variety of depth and temporal variations highlighting the importance of soil textural differentiation, root uptake depths, as well as event to seasonal precipitation effects. Data such as these are greatly needed for improving our understanding of ecohydrological processes within tropical forests and for improving models of these systems in the face of changing environmental conditions.},

To do this, we used structural equation modeling (SEM). The measurement submodel predicts the latent “generalized fertility,” FG, of a soil using four indicator variables: the relative growth rates of Festuca rubra, Trifolium pratense, Triticum aestivum, and Arabidopsis thaliana. The direct causes of FG in this study were the supply rates of NO3−, P, and K as well as three indirect causes consisting of three physical soil properties, but these can change between studies. The model was calibrated using 76 grassland soils from southern Quebec, Canada and independently tested using aboveground net primary productivity (NPP) of the natural vegetation over two growing seasons. Both the measurement submodel and the full SEM fit the data well. The FG values predicted 51\% of the variance in NPP and were a better predictor than any other single variable, including the actual nutrient flux rates. Furthermore, this model can be applied to grassland soils anywhere because of its modular nature in which the causes and effects of soil fertility are clearly separated.},

We present results exploring the potential for NWM soil moisture and streamflow analyses to inform operational drought monitoring. Both agricultural and hydrologic drought monitoring rely either explicitly or implicitly on an accurate representation of anomalous soil moisture values. Much of our analysis focuses on comparisons of soil moisture anomalies in the NWM to those from in-situ observations. To establish benchmarks for NWM soil moisture skill, we also include other gridded data sets currently used to inform the US Drought Monitor, specifically those from the North American Land Data Assimilation System phase 2 (NLDAS-2) land surface models. We then compare NWM streamflow low flows with ∼500 stream gauges from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Hydro-Climatic Data Network of undisturbed basins. The NWM soil moisture simulation’s skill parallels that from NLDAS-2. The accuracy of drought condition identification from NWM streamflow exceeds that based on soil moisture as determined by Critical Success Index scores for extreme dry percentiles. Different meteorological forcings are used in the operational NWM cycles than those used in this retrospective analysis. This forcing disconnect, together with concerns about current-generation land surface model soil moisture-transport schemes, inhibit its current operational use for drought monitoring.},

This study investigated the usefulness of integrating canopy sensing tools and soil N content to estimate grain yield and N requirement at various corn development stages. Six to seven N rates at 35–45 kg urea-N ha–1 increments were pre-plant applied in 12 sites throughout Minnesota. Canopy-sensing measurements were obtained at the V4, V8, V12, and R1 stages. Soil (0–30 and 0–60 cm) NH4–N and NO3–N concentrations were measured at the V4, V8, and V12 stages. Adjusting sensor measurements with soil NO3–N (0–30 cm) measured at the V4 stage provided the best trade-off between gains in prediction accuracy and practicality for soil sampling. At the V4 stage, predictions of N requirement with soil N alone (RMSE = 41.3 kg N ha–1) and soil-N–adjusted sensor measurements (RMSE ranging from 39.6 to 42.7 kg N ha–1) were similar but better than predictions with unadjusted sensor measurements (RMSE ranging from 61.0 to 72.9 kg N ha–1). Although the utility of canopy sensing without soil-N adjustments improved at later development stages, the most accurate predictions of N requirement were obtained with soil-N–adjusted sensor measurements collected at V8 and V12 (RMSE as low as 32.5 kg N ha–1). Our study shows that early-season canopy sensing (up to V8) coupled with soil N measurements may be a viable alternative to improve in-season N management.},

We develop a new LDAS that can improve the skill of an ecohydrological model to simulate simultaneously surface soil moisture, root-zone soil moisture, and vegetation dynamics by assimilating passive microwave observations that are sensitive to both surface soil moisture and terrestrial biomass. This LDAS first calibrates both hydrological and ecological parameters of a land surface model, which explicitly simulates vegetation growth and senescence. Then, it adjusts the model states of soil moisture and leaf area index (LAI) sequentially using a genetic particle filter. We can adjust the subsurface soil moisture, which is not observed directly by satellites, because we simulate the interactions between vegetation dynamics and subsurface water dynamics. From a point-scale evaluation, we succeed in improving the performance of our land surface model and generate ensembles of the model state whose distribution reflects the combined information in the land surface model and satellite observations. We show that the adjustment of the subsurface soil moisture significantly improves the capacity to simulate vegetation dynamics in seasonal forecast timescales. This LDAS can contribute to the generation of ensemble initial conditions of surface and subsurface soil moisture and LAI for a probabilistic framework of weather and seasonal forecasting.},

In this study, we conducted a 15N tracer pot experiment involving five different fertilizer treatments in soils with five different total organic carbon levels under field conditions. The average NUE ranged from 36 to 56\% 15N-urea and 0.1 to 0.2\% residual N in the first and second seasons. The N retained in the soil ranged from 10 to 28\%, and the N lost to water and the atmosphere ranged from 29 to 39\% in the five soils. Compared with that in the low-fertility soils, NUE in the high-fertility soils was 20–45\% greater, and N loss was 1 –6\% lower. The results showed that higher soil fertility corresponded to higher NUE and lower N loss. We suggest that although the local customary N fertilizer application rate (N3; 165 kg N/ha) in the study area is reasonable for low-fertility soils, after soil fertility improvements, an approximately 50\% reduction of N fertilizer should be implemented.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas The FCM SEA was used for sampling and spatial estimation of soil moisture patterns. Multispectral remote sensing and terrain data were combined to guide the sampling and estimation. Selected vegetation patterns and terrain data provided reasonable estimates of soil moisture. The FCM SEA was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed variance. The FCM SEA was superior to an approach driven solely by terrain data. Detailed information on the temporal and spatial evolution of soil moisture patterns is of fundamental importance to improve runoff prediction, optimize irrigation management and to enhance crop forecasting. However, obtaining representative soil moisture measurements at the catchment scale is challenging because of the dynamic spatial and temporal behavior of soil moisture. High-resolution remote sensing data provide detailed spatial information about catchment characteristics (e.g., terrain and land use) that can be used as proxies to estimate soil moisture. We assessed the potential use of combined multitemporal multispectral remote sensing (RS) and terrain data for estimating spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale. The fuzzy c-means sampling and estimation approach (FCM SEA) was applied to conduct a sensor (proxy) directed (guided) sampling and to reconstruct multitemporal soil moisture patterns based on time domain reflectometry measurements. A comprehensive soil moisture database for the Schäfertal catchment, located in central Germany, was used to test, validate, and compare the FCM SEA performances of the combined remote sensing data with those of a benchmark approach driven solely by terrain data. Results from the study show that a FCM SEA model that integrates bi-temporal RS imagery and terrain data was more effective in estimating spatial soil moisture patterns relative to the benchmark model. It outperformed the benchmark model in 58\% of the cases and was stable to explain about 50\% of the total observed variance for a range of different catchment moisture conditions. This was achieved with only a small sample size (n = 30). The results of this study are promising because they highlight the importance of considering multitemporal RS and terrain data and demonstrate how in situ sensors can be optimally placed to enable cost-efficient monitoring and prediction of spatial soil moisture patterns at the small catchment scale.},

We propose two complementary strategies for estimation of evapotranspiration rates and root water uptake profiles from soil-moisture sensor-array data. One is our implementation of ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF); it treats the evapotranspiration sink term in the Richards equation, rather than soil moisture, as the observable to update. The other is a maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) applied to the same observable; it is supplemented with the Fisher information matrix to quantify uncertainty in its predictions. We use numerical experiments to demonstrate the accuracy and computational efficiency of these techniques. We found our EnKF implementation to be two orders of magnitude faster than either the standard EnKF or MLE, and our MLE procedure to require an order of magnitude fewer iterations to converge than its counterpart applied to soil moisture. These findings render our methodologies a viable and practical tool for estimation of the root water uptake profiles and evaporation rates, with the MLE technique to be used when the prior knowledge about evapotranspiration at the site is elusive.},

	abstract = {We present here a simple and robust framework for quantifying the effective sensor depth of cosmic ray soil moisture neutron probes such that reliable water fluxes may be computed from a time series of cosmic ray soil moisture. In particular, we describe how the neutron signal depends on three near-surface hydrogen sources: surface water, soil moisture, and lattice water (water in minerals present in soil solids) and also their vertical variations. Through a combined modeling study of one-dimensional water flow in soil and neutron transport in the atmosphere and subsurface, we compare average water content between the simulated soil moisture profiles and the universal calibration equation which is used to estimate water content from neutron counts. By using a linear sensitivity weighting function, we find that during evaporation and drainage periods the RMSE of the two average water contents is 0.0070 m3 m−3 with a maximum deviation of 0.010 m3 m−3 for a range of soil types. During infiltration, the RMSE is 0.011 m3 m−3 with a maximum deviation of 0.020 m3 m−3, where piston like flow conditions exists for the homogeneous isotropic media. Because piston flow is unlikely during natural conditions at the horizontal scale of hundreds of meters that is measured by the cosmic ray probe, this modeled deviation of 0.020 m3 m−3 represents the worst case scenario for cosmic ray sensing of soil moisture. Comparison of cosmic ray soil moisture data and a distributed sensor soil moisture network in Southern Arizona indicates an RMSE of 0.011 m3 m−3 over a 6 month study period.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture is a key modifier of runoff generation from rainfall excess, including during extreme precipitation events associated with Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). This paper presents a new, publicly available dataset from a soil moisture monitoring network in Northern California's Russian River Basin, designed to assess soil moisture controls on runoff generation under AR conditions. The observations consist of 2-min volumetric soil moisture at 19 sites and 6 depths (5, 10, 15, 20, 50, and 100 cm), starting in summer 2017. The goals of this monitoring network are to aid the development of research applications and situational awareness tools for Forecast-Informed Reservoir Operations at Lake Mendocino. We present short analyses of these data to demonstrate their capability to characterize soil moisture responses to precipitation across sites and depths, including time series analysis, correlation analysis, and identification of soil saturation thresholds that induce runoff. Our results show strong inter-site Pearson's correlations ({\textgreater}0.8) at the seasonal timescale. Correlations are strong ({\textgreater}0.8) during events with high antecedent soil moisture and during drydown periods, and weak ({\textless}0.5) otherwise. High event runoff ratios are observed when antecedent soil moisture thresholds are exceeded, and when antecedent runoff is high. Although local heterogeneity in soil moisture can limit the utility of point source data in some hydrologic model applications, our analyses indicate three ways in which soil moisture data are valuable for model design: (1) sensors installed at 6 depths per location enable us to identify the soil depth below which evapotranspiration and saturation dynamics change, and therefore choose model soil layer depths, (2) time series analysis indicates the role of soil moisture processes in controlling runoff ratio during precipitation, which hydrologic models should replicate, and (3) spatial correlation analysis of the soil moisture fluctuations helps identify when and where distributed hydrologic modelling may be beneficial.},

	abstract = {Soil water content (SWC, \% vol) is a key factor affecting plant growth and development. SWC measurement is vital to rational use of water resources for irrigation, and the accuracy of sensors in SWC measurement is of significant importance to smart data-driven irrigation. Here, a laboratory experiment and a field lysimetric experiment were conducted to evaluate the accuracy of Insentek sensors under various soil conditions (1.1 to 1.5 bulk densities and sand to clay soil textures) and irrigation levels (30, 45, and 60 mm), in 2018 and 2019. A microweighing lysimeter and oven-drying method were used as standard methods to compare the Insentek method. The root mean square error (RMSE, \% vol) and relative prediction deviation (RPD) between the Insentek and microlysimetric SWC values were 0.89–1.04\% vol and 5.6–6.8, respectively, under laboratory condition. The RPD value is larger than the threshold value of 4.0, indicating the accuracy of the Insentek sensors is reliable under laboratory condition. Except for 60 mm irrigation treatment, the RMSE between Insentek and the oven-drying method under field condition was 1.44–1.93\% vol, and the RPD value was 1.56–1.93, lower than the threshold value of 4.0. The tiny gap between the Insentek sensor and soil may accelerate water infiltration along the probe 0-3 d after irrigation while increase air filling 5–7 d after irrigation, causing greater RMSE and lower RPD values. The dissatisfied performance in field condition may also be associated with the obvious drawbacks of oven-drying method, such as disturbance in soil sampling. When using oven-drying method to analyze the accuracy of the Insentek sensors in field condition, the concerns should be well addressed.},

Hyperspectral (350–2500 nm) monitoring of soil moisture content (SMC) could provide a theoretical basis for the real-time estimation of spatial and temporal variations in soil moisture. During this study, we have developed SMC prediction models in different soil moisture ranges by using the combination of spectral preprocessing methods and optimized spectral indices. Results indicated that first-order derivative (FD) preprocessing method can highlight the effective information of the spectra and improve the correlation between spectral reflectance and SMC. The spectral reflectance exhibited a strong correlation with SMC near 1400, 1700, 1900, and 2200 nm. The FD-NDSI-W0-model had the best SMC prediction and applicability (R2 = 0.977, root mean square error = 3.413\%, relative percent deviation = 6.171) to predict SMCs. Overall, pretreatment methods, combined with the two-band random combination to optimize the spectral index to build a prediction model of SMC, could be applied for accurate monitoring of SMC.},

Frequency Domain Reflectometry soil moisture probes, installed in close proximity to water table monitoring wells were used to derive changes in the soil water storage. A one-dimensional transect model was developed; changes in the soil water storage and water table observations served as input to determine all vertical and lateral boundary fluxes along the shallow water table flow plane. Two distinct land cover environments, grassland and an alluvial wetland forest, were investigated in this particular study. The analysis provided temporally variable ET estimates for the two land covers with annual totals averaging 850 mm for grassland, to 1100 mm for the alluvial wetland forest. Quantitative estimates of other components of a water budget, for example, infiltration, interception capture, total rainfall excess, and runoff were also made on a quarterly and annual basis.

	abstract = {Abstract Computational models are useful to estimate agricultural greenhouse gas emissions at regional scales. However, empirically based parameter values are required for the models to accurately represent carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) mineralization rates of different organic amendments in more and less humid regions or during wet and dry periods of the growing season. A controlled environment study was conducted to assess the rates of C and N mineralization in differently processed sewage sludge (biosolids) in wet and dry soil. Parameter values were estimated for use in modelling the degradation of three types of biosolids. A loam soil with either 49\% water-filled pore space (WFPS) or 29\% WFPS was amended with mesophilic anaerobically digested (digested), alkaline-stabilized, or composted biosolids. Headspace samples were collected and analysed for carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O), and soil samples for nitrate (NO3−) and ammonium (NH4+). Four different first-order models were fitted to the cumulative CO2–C and N2O–N data (R2 {\textgreater} 0.98), and soil NO3− (R2 {\textgreater} 0.65) and NH4+ (R2 {\textgreater} 0.93) concentrations. CO2–C data indicated that C mineralization was higher in soil with 49\% WFPS than in soils with 29\% WFPS. Seventy-nine percent of the C compounds in digested biosolids degraded in soil with 49\% WFPS, compared with 52\% for alkaline-stabilized biosolids and 8\% for composted biosolids. The fitted coefficient values were similar for all of the four first-order models used in this study and provide useful information for parameterizing more sophisticated mechanistic models of the degradation of biosolids in soil.},

Strong soil moisture feedbacks on the daily mean and maximum temperatures identified by the CCSM-WRF model system mainly appear over the region from southern Siberia through eastern Mongolia to northeast China, the Tibetan Plateau, and most areas of central and east China, accounting for 30\%−70\% of the total variances. Meanwhile, the simulated soil moisture feedbacks on daily minimum temperature are shown to be much weaker than those on daily mean and maximum temperatures. The soil moisture-temperature feedbacks in the CCSM-WRF model system are generally well validated with those from two reanalysis products. The analysis of the physical processes shows that soil moisture feedback strength is mainly determined by the ability of soil moisture to influence the local surface heat fluxes and planetary boundary layer processes. The reasonable simulations of present soil moisture-temperature feedbacks indicate that the CCSM-WRF model system can be further applied to understand the role of soil moisture in influencing projected climate change over East Asia.},

This study of system in which only chemical fertilizers had been used over a long period enabled long-term yield declines of rice and wheat at different levels and combinations of NPK fertilizers to be evaluated. The highest rate of yield decline in both rice and wheat was found when 120 kg ha−1 N was applied alone. The lowest rate of decline was observed when all three nutrients (N, P and K) were applied, at 40, 35 and 33 kg ha−1 for N, P and K, respectively, followed by 120, 35 and 33 kg ha−1 (currently recommended levels). The yield response of rice and wheat to N fertilizer declined over the 20 years, with a higher rate of decline in wheat. In contrast, the response to applied P and K increased with time in both crops, with a higher response rate in wheat. With continuous application of N and P fertilizers, there was a marginal change in available N and K in the soil over time, but an approximately 3-fold increase in available P and an approximately 2-fold increase in available S were obtained by regular dressing of P fertilizer (SSP: 7 \% P, 12 \% S) over 20 years. The results revealed that balanced, high doses of NPK fertilizers are required to maintain soil fertility and raise grain yields.},

	abstract = {Operational land surface models (LSMs) compute hydrologic states such as soil moisture that are needed for a range of important applications (e.g., drought, flood, and weather prediction). The uncertainty in LSM parameters is sufficiently great that several researchers have proposed conducting parameter estimation using globally available remote sensing data to identify best fit local parameter sets. However, even with in situ data at fine modeling scales, there can be significant remaining uncertainty in LSM parameters and outputs. Here, using a new uncertainty estimation subsystem of the NASA Land Information System (LIS) (described herein), a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique is applied to conduct Bayesian analysis for the accounting of parameter uncertainties. The Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) MCMC algorithm was applied, for which a new parallel implementation was developed. A case study is examined that builds on previous work in which the Noah LSM was calibrated to passive (L-band) microwave remote sensing estimates of soil moisture for the Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed. In keeping with prior related studies, the parameters subjected to the analysis were restricted to the soil hydraulic properties (SHPs). The main goal is to estimate SHPs and soil moisture simulation uncertainty before and after consideration of the remote sensing data. The prior SHP uncertainty is based on the original source of the standard SHP lookup tables for the Noah LSM. Conclusions are drawn regarding the value and viability of Bayesian analysis over alternative approaches (e.g., parameter estimation, lookup tables) and further research needs are identified.},

	abstract = {A wireless sensor network (WSN) was deployed as part of a water balance instrument cluster across a forested 1 km2headwater catchment in the southern Sierra Nevada of California. The network, which integrates readings from over 300 sensors, provides spatially representative measurements of snow depth, solar radiation, relative humidity, soil moisture, and matric potential. The ability of this densely instrumented watershed to capture catchment-scale snow depth and soil moisture distributions is investigated through comparison with three comprehensive gridded surveys and 1 day of detailed lidar snow data. Statistical analysis shows that the network effectively characterized catchment-wide distributions of snow depth, while offering a cost-effective, reliable, and energy-efficient means for collecting distributed data in real time. A temporal analysis of snow depth variability reveals that canopy cover is the major explanatory variable of snow depth and that under-canopy measurements persistently show higher variability compared to those in open terrain. An analysis of soil moisture shows lower variability at deeper soil depth and a correlation between mean soil moisture and variability for shallow soils. A three-phase design procedure was used to optimize the WSN deployment. First, as off-the-shelf performance of current WSN platforms for large-scale, long-term deployments cannot be guaranteed, statistics from a prototype deployment were analyzed. Two indicators of network performance, the packet delivery ratio and received signal strength indicator, showed that for our site conditions, a conservative 50 m node-to-node spacing would ensure low-power, reliable, and robust network communications. Second, results from the prototype were used to refine hardware specifications and to guide the layout of the full 57-node wireless network. Of these nodes, 23 were used actively for sensing, while the remaining 34 nodes were used as signal repeaters to ensure proper spatial radio coverage and robust network operations. Further analysis of network statistics is conducted during the third, operational, phase to validate system performance.},

Besides being a staple food crop, cassava can be used as raw material for the production of industrial starch and ethanol. The potential of cassava as an industrial commercial crop has not been exploited to a large extent because of perceptions that cassava depletes soils. Recent finding from field studies in the forest/savannah transitional agroecological zone of Ghana indicates that when integrated in the cropping system as a form of rotation, cassava contributes significantly to maintenance of soil fertility, and thus large scale production of cassava for industrial use can contribute to poverty reduction in an environmentally responsive way.

This work is aimed at analyzing the spatiotemporal changes in extractable soil P content at the regional level by means of a soil test database and then comparing results with independent data from agricultural censuses. A total of 228 079 soil P-test values [Dyer method: 1:5 soil-citric acid solution (20 g/L) ratio] generated between 1980 and 2003 by certified commercial laboratories in Brittany (northwestern France) were integrated into a database. Changes in P were analysed by considering four 4–6 year periods between 1980 and 2003 using cumulative frequencies and summary statistics performed on raw soil test values. Then data were aggregated into discrete entities (canton: administrative entities) and summary statistics, linear regression and spatial distribution were carried out. P balances were measured for the same entities taken from the agricultural censuses of 1979, 1988 and 2000. Over the entire study period, a marked spatial variability was observed with higher P content in the western part of Brittany, as well as a systematic increase in median P content with lower amplitude over the past decade. The mean cantonal soil P surplus accumulated over 24 years amounted to 763 kg P/ha of usable agricultural land. Similar P balances sometimes gave rise to widely different increases in P. Cumulative balances were positively correlated with an increase in soil P (r2 = 0.34).},

	abstract = {Abstract The accuracy and precision of the cosmic-ray neutron sensor (CRNS) neutron count and soil moisture estimate are affected differently by distinct neutron moderating factors. Moreover, whereas the accuracy can be improved by correcting for different hydrogen pools, the precision can only be improved by increasing the surface area of the CRNS sensors or by increasing the integration time. To date, the effects of different neutron moderating factors on CRNS accuracy and precision are not completely understood. We used data from three agricultural and low biomass sites located within a few kilometres distance from each other in South England. We developed an extended version of the COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Interaction Code (COSMIC), which included the effects of relevant neutron moderating factors on the neutron counts. With sensitivity analysis, we found atmospheric pressure and soil moisture content to be most influential on neutron count accuracy and precision. These two factors were, respectively, seven and four times more important than soil bulk density, lattice water and soil organic matter. Above ground biomass was substantially less influential compared to these variables. However, because the three sites had similar soil organic matter and meteorology, calibration results showed that differences between sites could be mostly explained by differences in above ground biomass and to a lesser extent intercepted water. The neutron count differences due to above ground biomass corresponded with substantial soil moisture estimate differences up to 0.07cm3cm−3; a significant effect on soil moisture accuracy. The precision of the soil moisture estimate was 10 times more sensitive to soil moisture than other factors and was therefore mostly a function of soil moisture content itself. The neutron count integration times required to obtain a soil moisture precision were typically less than a day. Our results are indicative for other humid, temperate, agricultural sites.},

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the distribution of soil moisture is notoriously difficult in topographically complex regions that are subject to both large-scale climate gradients and fine-scale effects of terrain, vegetation, and soil structure. Remote sensing approaches capture large-scale moisture patterns but are limited in spatial and temporal resolution, while commercial field sensors remain too expensive to deploy intensively over large spatial extents. Here, we demonstrate the use of low-cost ({\textless}20 USD) custom sensors to create a large monitoring network of surficial (0–15 cm depth) volumetric soil moisture content (VMC) across Great Smoky Mountains National Park (GSMNP) (NC, TN, USA). In laboratory tests, temperature-calibrated VMC values approached the accuracy of commercial probes. We deployed over 80 sensors across multiple watersheds, topographic positions, and a 1,800-m elevation gradient, and created hierarchical models to understand associations of VMC with spatial (30-m resolution) and temporal (daily) variables related to water supply and demand. Elevation had the strongest association with VMC, with a fivefold increase across the gradient reflecting 1.5-fold changes in both (increased) precipitation and (decreased) evapotranspiration; slope angle was a strong mediating factor. Common proxies for moisture including topographic convergence index were not associated with VMC, likely due to limited contributions of surface drainage to local water balance. Our model predicted daily VMC of a set of validation sensors with a root mean square error of 4.8\%, which may be improved by site-specific field calibration. Our study indicates that spatially extensive, field-based soil moisture networks are practical, accurate, and an important component of regional environmental monitoring.},

In civil industries including the agriculture engineering and the forestry engineering, moisture sensors are widely used to test and monitor the engineering properties and long-term service performance of soil. The influence of multiple factors on the quality and the accuracy of the soil moisture sensor should be taken into account. Both laboratory and field tests were performed by the time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method. The soil dielectric constant and magnetic permeability under different moisture contents, different temperatures, and different dry densities were comprehensively evaluated. At the same time, the sensitive factors in the service performance of the TDR sensor have been revealed by the real state of tested soil samples. Based on the testing principle of TDR, a calibration calculation model has been developed to evaluate accurately the moisture content of the subgrade slope. The results show that both the moisture content and the dry density had a significant influence on the dielectric constant and the magnetic permeability of soil. The developed calculation model has a good fitting effect and stability. Through the model, the influence of moisture content and temperature on the soil dielectric constant has been analyzed, and the fitting goodness is above 90\%. After half a year of settlement, the soil was gradually drained and consolidated, and the moisture content of the subgrade section gradually decreased. It verified that the monitoring method determined by the laboratory calibration test was effective and accurate.},

To further investigate the capacity of this method, we have undertaken an extensive field study using multifrequency (i.e., 225, 450, and 900 MHz) DGW measurements to monitor a complete annual cycle of soil water content variations typical of midlatitude climates at three sites with different soil textures. The use of common-midpoint surveys allowed us to understand the nature and evolution of the near-surface electromagnetic wavefields and their impact on DGW moisture predictions. We present the novel characterization of a wide-range of seasonal moisture dynamics including soil freezing and thawing process using multifrequency DGW measurements for a range of soil textures. These data showed significant temporal variations in both the near-surface wavefield and multifrequency DGW velocities corresponding to both seasonal and shorter-term variations in soil conditions. Although all of the measurement sites displayed similar temporal responses, the rate and magnitude of these velocity variations corresponded to varying soil water contents, which were controlled by the soil textural properties. Although there were no observed systematic differences in DGW velocities due to frequency dispersion for the 225–900 MHz range, the DGW measurements obtained using higher-frequency antennas was less impacted by near-surface wavefield interference due to their shorter signal pulse duration. DGW velocity measurements combined with an appropriate dielectric mixing formula provided quantitative predictions of soil water content that accurately replicated the soil sample data over the annual cycle of moisture conditions.},

Results suggest that while θ0–60 is indeed more valuable than θ5 for predicting near-future vegetation anomalies, the enhanced information content in θ0–60 soil moisture can be effectively duplicated by the low-pass transformation of θ5. This implies that, for drought monitoring applications, the shallow vertical penetration depth of microwave-based θ5 retrievals does not represent as large a practical limitation as commonly perceived.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture is a key drought indicator; however, current in situ soil moisture infrastructure is inadequate for large-scale drought monitoring. One initiative of the ongoing National Soil Moisture Network program is the development of a near real-time drought monitoring product that integrates in situ, model, and satellite remote sensing data. Data integration from diverse sources requires large-scale validation prior to integration. This study develops a framework for assessing the fidelity of in situ, model, and satellite soil moisture data sets. Here we evaluate data from over 100 in situ monitoring stations that are part of nine monitoring networks; North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 and Climate Prediction Center land surface models; and Soil Moisture Active-Passive, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and European Space Agency-Climate Change Initiative (ESA-CCI) satellite products. The results indicate the majority of in situ stations exhibit low error variance and are spatially representative; however, some networks and individual stations exhibit anomalously high error variance or are sited in a way that make them not spatially representative of a larger area. Overall, North American Land Data Assimilation System Phase 2 is the modeled product that consistently performed best, and Soil Moisture Active-Passive L3 is the remotely sensed product that consistently performed the best. They were able to both capture in situ soil moisture variability and provide an accurate depiction of drought conditions. The methods and verification framework applied in this study can be used to evaluate any soil moisture data set in any region of the world.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, remote sensing satellites, including Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP), continuously monitor SM of the earth. However, the spatial resolution of the remotely sensed SM is insufficient for some hydrological applications. In this paper, a data-driven model is proposed based on a hybrid approach called artificial neural network kriging (ANNK) to capture the interaction between SM and ancillary data (AD), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), altitude, slope, Antecedent Moisture Condition, AMC (5-day cumulative precipitation), and daily air temperature (DAT)/land surface temperature (LST). By co-regionalization of the estimated SM from the ANNK and SMAP 36-km product, SM in any part of the study area is estimated more accurately and on a finer resolution (1-km). Finally, through a linear relationship between in-situ SM with the up-to-date AD including AMC (previous 5-day cumulative precipitation), LST or DAT, slope, NDVI, and the downscaled satellite SM, the soil moisture estimates are adjusted by also adding an error term. Estimation of the final SM product in terms of the Unbiased Root Mean Square Error of less than 0.04 m3/m3 meets the accuracy requirements of the SMAP SM retrieval. Moreover, the results of SM validation show that the proposed technique has a potential for real-time SM estimations in developing areas.},

The spatial structure of the analysis increments obtained from both analyses are comparable. However, the EKF-based increments are generally higher for the top soil layers then for the bottom layer. This gradient better reflects the underlying hydrological processes in that the strongest interaction between soil moisture and bare soil evaporation and transpiration through vegetation should occur in top layers where most of the roots are located. The impact on the forecast skill, e.g., air temperature at 2 m and 500 hPa height, is neutral. The new EKF surface analysis system offers a range of further development options for the exploitation of satellite observations for the initialization of the land surface in Numerical Weather Prediction.},

	abstract = {Abstract For monitoring soil fertility after changing farm management from highly conventional to organic farming on the newly established research farm of Kassel University, two permanent–soil monitoring sites were installed in 1999. Representative locations for installing the permanent–soil monitoring sites were selected using geographical information systems (GIS), based on available data from geology, topography, soil taxation, land use, and intensive auger-borehole records and analysis with a very high spatial resolution of data. The soils are represented by a Luvisol derived from loess and a Vertisol developed from claystone. The soil properties of the two monitoring sites measured immediately after changing to organic farming showed high contents of extractable nutrients as a result of the former intensive fertilization practice during conventional farm management. The microbial soil properties of the two monitoring sites were in the medium range of regional soils. A first evaluation of the development of soil properties was done after 5 y of monitoring. The soil organic-matter content increased slightly after grass-clover and after application of farmyard manure. The amounts of K and P decreased clearly at the loess site without application of farmyard manure. At the clay site, the unique application of farmyard manure led to increasing contents of extractable K and P in the top soil. The variation of soil properties increased clearly after perennial crops like grass-clover and in years after application of farmyard manure.},

	abstract = {Summary This paper presents the results of a two-year experiment carried out in mountain areas on soil moisture retrieval from remotely sensed images. In particular, fully polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (SAR) RADARSAT and single polarization ASAR images were used. During acquisitions of SAR over the test area in Alto Adige, Südtirol region, northern Italy, extensive field measurements were carried out to characterize the area in terms of soil moisture variability, vegetation cover and soil properties. The area is equipped with 17 meteorological stations that also provide information on soil moisture on an hourly basis. To deal with the process of soil moisture retrieval from SAR images in this challenging environment, an advanced algorithm based on the support vector regression (SVR) technique and the integration of ancillary data were successfully proposed. The selected method was also combined with an innovative multi-objective strategy for model selection. The results indicate that the use of polarimetric features such as horizontal-horizontal polarization (HH) and horizontal-vertical polarization (HV) channels improves the estimation of SMC in the mountain area investigated, in particular because the HV channel contributes to disentangling the effect of vegetation on the radar signal. The root mean square error (RMSE) indicates accuracy of retrieval for soil moisture values of around 5\%, which is well within the requirements for estimating soil moisture from remotely sensed data. This work was carried out with the main aim of demonstrating the feasibility of soil moisture retrieval in mountain areas with high-resolution images in view of the upcoming Sentinel 1 mission.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture is a crucial parameter to determine the crop water requirement for irrigation. The soil moisture deficit (SMD) of the root zone is an indicator that can be used to determine the exact crop water requirement. Application of the recent technology of COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observation System (Cosmos) provides continuous, integrated, area-based values, with a measurement radius of up to 400 m, whilst being non-invasive. In a field experiment in Italy, the Cosmos probe was used over a mixed crop area during the cropping seasons of 2014 and 2015. The results showed that soil moisture values obtained by Cosmos were comparable with those obtained for the top 0–60 cm layer soil moisture measured by sensors, soil cores, profile probes and with values simulated by the SALTMED model. This indicates that the Cosmos probe's effective depth of sensing is within the top 0–60 cm. Knowing that almost 80\% of the crop root system is accommodated within the top 0–60 cm, the Cosmos measurement could be useful for monitoring the soil water status and SMD in the root zone in irrigated agriculture. The Cosmos system could be made operational for irrigation managers to determine when and how much to irrigate. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Thus, using 670 SM stations worldwide, we evaluated and compared SM products from microwave remote sensing [Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) (C- and X-bands) and European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI)], land surface model [Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS)], and reanalysis data [ECMWF Re-Analysis-Interim (ERA-Interim) and National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)] under different time scales and various climates and land covers. We find that: (a) ESA CCI and GLDAS have the closest values to the in situ SM on the annual scale, whereas others overestimate the SM; ERA-Interim (averaged R = 0.58) and ESA CCI (averaged R = 0.54) correlate best with the in situ data, while GLDAS performs worst. (b) Overall, the deviations of each product vary in seasons. ESA CCI and ERA-Interim products are closer to the in situ SM at seasonal scales, and AMSR-E and NCEP perform worst in December–February and June–August, respectively. (c) Except for NCEP and ERA-Interim, others can well reflect the intermonthly variation of the in situ SM. (d) Under various climates and land covers, AMSR-E products are less effective in cold climates, whereas GLDAS and NCEP products perform poorly in arid or temperate and dry climates. Moreover, the Bias and R of each SM product differ obviously under different forest types, especially the AMSR-E products. In summary, SM from ESA CCI is the best, followed by ERA-Interim product, and precipitation is an important auxiliary data for selecting high-quality SM stations and improving the accuracy of SM from GLDAS. These results can provide a reference for improving the accuracy of the above SM products.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture (SM) at the local scale is required to account for small-scale spatial heterogeneity of land surface because many hydrological processes manifest at scales ranging from cm to km. Although remote sensing (RS) platforms provide large-scale soil moisture dynamics, scale discrepancy between observation scale (e.g., approximately several kilometers) and modeling scale (e.g., few hundred meters) leads to uncertainties in the performance of land surface hydrologic models. To overcome this drawback, we developed a new deterministic downscaling algorithm (DDA) for estimating fine-scale soil moisture with pixel-based RS soil moisture and evapotranspiration (ET) products using a genetic algorithm. This approach was evaluated under various synthetic and field experiments (Little Washita-LW 13 and 21, Oklahoma) conditions including homogeneous and heterogeneous land surface conditions composed of different soil textures and vegetations. Our algorithm is based on determining effective soil hydraulic properties for different subpixels within a RS pixel and estimating the long-term soil moisture dynamics of individual subpixels using the hydrological model with the extracted soil hydraulic parameters. The soil moisture dynamics of subpixels from synthetic experiments matched well with the observations under heterogeneous land surface condition, although uncertainties (Mean Bias Error, MBE: −0.073 to −0.049) exist. Field experiments have typically more variations due to weather conditions, measurement errors, unknown bottom boundary conditions, and scale discrepancy between remote sensing pixel and model grid resolution. However, the soil moisture estimates of individual subpixels (from the airborne Electronically Scanned Thinned Array Radiometer (ESTAR) footprints of 800 m × 800 m) downscaled by this approach matched well (R: 0.724 to −0.914, MBE: −0.203 to −0.169 for the LW 13; R: 0.343–0.865, MBE: −0.165 to −0.122 for the LW 21) with the in situ local scale soil moisture measurements during Southern Great Plains Experiment 1997 (SGP97). The good correspondence of observed soil water characteristics θ(h) functions (from the soil core samples) and genetic algorithm (GA) searched soil parameters at the LW 13 and 21 sites demonstrated the robustness of the algorithm. Although the algorithm is tested under limited conditions at field scale, this approach improves the availability of remotely sensed soil moisture product at finer resolution for various land surface and hydrological model applications.},

	abstract = {Recently improved ECH2O soil moisture sensors have received significant attention in many field and laboratory applications. Focusing on the EC-5 sensor, a simple and robust calibration method is proposed. The sensor-to-sensor variability in the readings (analog-to-digital converter (ADC) counts) among 30 EC-5 sensors was relatively small but not negligible. A large number of ADC counts were taken under various volumetric water contents (θ) using four test sands. The proposed two-point α-mixing model, as well as linear and quadratic models, was fitted to the ADC – θ data. Unlike for conventional TDR measurements, the effect of sensor characteristics is lumped into the empirical parameter α in the two-point α-mixing model. The value of α was fitted to be 2.5, yielding a nearly identical calibration curve to the quadratic model. Errors in θ associated with the sensor-to-sensor variability for the two-point α-mixing model were ±0.005 cm3 cm−3 for dry sand and ±0.028 cm3 cm−3 for saturated sand. In the validation experiments, the highest accuracy in water content estimation was achieved when sensor-specific ADCdry and ADCsat were used in the two-point α-mixing model. Assuming that α = 2.5 is valid for most mineral soils, the two-point α-mixing model only requires the measurement of two extreme ADC counts in dry and saturated soils. Sensor-specific ADCdry and ADCsat counts are readily measured in most cases. Therefore, the two-point α-mixing model (with α = 2.5) can be considered as a quick, easy, and robust method for calibrating the ECH2O EC-5 sensor. Although further investigation is needed, the two-point α-mixing model may also be applied to calibrating other sensors.},

	abstract = {Calibration/validation experiments are critical to developing and testing soil moisture retrieval algorithms from microwave remote sensing platforms. Ground sampling must be optimally designed to minimize sources of error or bias during data collection. An important consideration in the design of ground sampling campaigns is that the in situ measured soil moisture is representative of the retrieval depth of a microwave sensor. Because of the popularity of portable impedance probe instruments, volumetric soil moisture is usually measured at a constant depth of approximately 0 to 6 cm and aggregated over a spatial extent representative of a pixel footprint. However, the retrieval depth of microwave signals can vary, and in agricultural soils is typically representative of the top ∼5 cm (or less) of the soil surface. It is unknown whether this mismatch between the depth of ground measured soil moisture and microwave retrieved soil moisture significantly contributes to error during sensor calibration/validation. This issue is addressed based on an analysis of over 3400 impedance probe measurements collected in 72 agricultural fields over four sampling occasions. Volumetric soil moisture was measured at depths of approximately 6 and 3 cm, at 24 locations in each field. The observed soil moisture sampling distributions and statistical moments are compared between these two measurement depths. Results demonstrate that the majority of fields exhibit a near-normal sampling distribution at both the 6- (60 of 72) and 3-cm (59 of 72) depths. An average difference of 0.016 m3 m−3 exists between all field means, generally indicating that wetter measurements are observed from the samples at 6 cm than those at 3 cm. Statistically significant differences were found between the measurement depths for field means (23 of 72), distributions (21 of 72), and variances (9 of 72). These findings demonstrate the importance of recognizing near-surface volumetric soil moisture spatial and depth variability effects during ground sampling experiments to minimize error in calibration/validation of retrieval algorithms.},

	abstract = {Abstract Accurate large-scale soil moisture (SM) maps are crucial for catchment-scale hydrological models used for water resource management and warning systems for droughts, floods, and wildfires. SM can be mapped by mobile cosmic-ray neutron (CRN) systems of moderated detectors at homogeneous landscapes of similar soil and vegetation. In this study, we present a new approach for mobile CRN detection to perform to its full potential, where CRN measurements can also be converted to SM at heterogeneous landscapes. The approach is based solely on thermal and epithermal neutron datasets obtained from mobile dual-spectra CRN detection, combined with theoretical developments using a particle transport model. For each measurement point, the land cover type is identified using the thermal-to-epithermal (T/E) ratio, and the relevant neutron-count-to-soil-moisture conversion function is estimated from CRN stations located at the main land cover types in the catchment. With this approach, the requirement of collecting 100+ soil samples for each point along the survey route is omitted. We use this T/E-dependent approach to obtain SM maps from 12 CRN surveys and compare it with a simple approach where only the conversion function from the agricultural site is used. SM by the simple approach is comparable to the estimates of the agricultural stations of a capacitance sensor network, while the estimates of the T/E-dependent approach also compare well with the heathland and forest stations. With accurate SM estimates for all landcover types, the average error is reduced from 0.089 to 0.038 when comparing CRN SM with space-borne Soil Moisture Active Passive Mission estimates.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas TxSON is a Core Cal/Val Site for the NASA SMAP, SMOS, and Sentinel programs. TxSON consists of 40 in situ locations nested within a 36-km EASE2 grid cell. Locations monitor soil moisture, temperature, and precipitation at 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm. Hourly, quality-controlled data from 2015 to 2018 are available. The spatiotemporal variability of soil water content (SWC) at the remote sensing scale requires dense monitoring for calibration and validation. Here, we present an overview of the Texas Soil Observation Network (TxSON), an intensively monitored area in the semiarid rangelands of the central Texas Hill Country. TxSON is a dense network consisting of 40 in situ locations nested at 36, 9, and 3 km within the Equal-Area Scalable Earth Grid and serves as a Core Calibration and Validation Site for NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive mission. The 4-yr dataset consists of hourly SWC measured at 5, 10, 20, and 50 cm. The SWC data are upscaled using arithmetic, Voronoi, and inverse distance weighting for 36-, (2) 9-, and (5) 3-km grid cells. We present the site selection, environmental characteristics, network design, quality assurance (QA), upscaling algorithms, and data structure. Ancillary data include bulk density, particle size, and carbon content for each site and depth. We also provide automated QA for each location and scripts to use our binary flagging in upscaling methods. To summarize, the 36-km grid cell has a mean bulk density of 1.34 ± 0.18 g cm−3 and a loam textural class. The in situ SWC has a root mean square error of 0.029 m3 m−3 against gravimetric data from 14 field campaigns. TxSON continues to add new locations with additional dense networks planned in other ecotones of the Edwards Plateau. The time series data along with scripts to import, plot, and upscaled SWC are available at https://doi.org/10.18738/T8/JJ16CF.},

	abstract = {Abstract Agricultural drought differs from meteorological, hydrological, and socioeconomic drought, being closely related to soil water availability in the root zone, specifically for crop and crop growth stage. In previous studies, several soil moisture indices (e.g., the soil moisture index, soil water deficit index) based on soil water availability have been developed for agricultural drought monitoring. However, when developing these indices, it was generally assumed that soil water availability to crops was equal throughout the root zone, and the effects of root distribution and crop growth stage on soil water uptake were ignored. This article aims to incorporate root distribution into a soil moisture-based index and to evaluate the performance of the improved soil moisture index for agricultural drought monitoring. The Huang-Huai-Hai Plain of China was used as the study area. Overall, soil moisture indices were significantly correlated with the crop moisture index (CMI), and the improved root-weighted soil moisture index (RSMI) was more closely related to the CMI than averaged soil moisture indices. The RSMI correctly identified most of the observed drought events and performed well in the detection of drought levels. Furthermore, the RSMI had a better performance than averaged soil moisture indices when compared to crop yield. In conclusion, soil moisture indices could improve agricultural drought monitoring by incorporating root distribution.},

However, soil moisture data availability is limited due to sparse in situ monitoring, particularly in mountain regions. Here we present methods, specifications, and initial results from the interactive Roaring Fork Observation Network (iRON), a soil, weather, and ecological monitoring system in the Southern Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Initiated in 2012, the network is currently composed of nine stations, distributed in elevation from 1,890 to 3,680 m, that continually collect and transmit measurements of soil moisture at three depths (5, 20, and 50 cm), soil temperature (20 cm), and meteorological conditions. Time-lapse cameras for phenological observations, snow depth sensors, and periodic co-located vegetation surveys complement selected stations. iRON was conceived and designed with the joint purpose of supporting bioclimatic research and resource management objectives in a snow-dominated watershed. In the short term, iRON data can be applied to assessing the impact of temperature and precipitation on seasonal soil moisture conditions and trends. As more data are collected over time, iRON will help improve understanding of climate-driven changes to soil, vegetation, and hydrologic conditions. In presenting this network and its initial data, we hope that the network's elevational gradient will contribute to bioclimatic mountain research, while active collaboration with partners in resource management may provide a model for science-practice interaction in support of long-term monitoring.},

	abstract = {Abstract Short-term agricultural drought and longer term hydrological drought have important ecological and socioeconomic impacts. Soil moisture monitoring networks have potential to assist in the quantification of drought conditions because soil moisture changes are mostly due to precipitation and evapotranspiration, the two dominant water balance components in most areas. In this study, the Palmer approach to calculating a drought index was combined with a soil water content-based moisture anomaly calculation. A drought lag time parameter was introduced to quantify the time between the start of a moisture anomaly and the onset of drought. The methodology was applied to four shortgrass prairie sites along a North-South transect in the U.S. Great Plains with an 18-year soil moisture record. Short time lags led to high periodicity of the resulting drought index, appropriate for assessing short-term drought conditions at the field scale (agricultural drought). Conversely, long time lags led to low periodicity of the drought index, being more indicative of long-term drought conditions at the watershed or basin scale (hydrological drought). The influence of daily, weekly, and monthly time steps on the drought index was examined and found to be marginal. The drought index calculated with a short drought lag time showed evidence of being normally distributed. A longer data record is needed to assess the statistical distribution of the drought index for longer drought lag times.},

	abstract = {Abstract In recent years, cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has shown a large potential among proximal sensing techniques to monitor soil moisture noninvasively, with high frequency and a large support volume (radius up to 240 m and sensing depth up to 80 cm). This signal is, however, more sensitive to closer distances and shallower depths. Inherently, CRNS-derived soil moisture is a spatially weighted value, different from an average soil moisture as retrieved by a sensor network. In this study, we systematically test a new profile shape correction on CRNS-derived soil moisture, based on additional soil moisture profile measurements and vertical unweighting, which is especially relevant during pronounced wetting or drying fronts. The analyses are conducted with data collected at four contrasting field sites, each equipped with a CRNS probe and a distributed soil moisture sensor network. After applying the profile shape correction on CRNS-derived soil moisture, it is compared with the sensor network average. Results show that the influence of the vertical sensitivity of CRNS on integral soil moisture values is successfully reduced. One to three properly located profile measurements within the CRNS support volume improve the performance. For the four investigated field sites, the RMSE decreased 11–53\% when only one profile location was considered. We therefore recommend to install along with a CRNS at least one soil moisture profile in a radial distance {\textless}100 m and a measurement depth down to 50 cm. Profile-shape-corrected, CRNS-derived soil moisture is an unweighted integral soil moisture over the support volume, which is easier to interpret and easier to use for further applications.},

This study was conducted to characterize the changes and dynamics of soil moisture in a mixed forest in northern Bavaria within 1 year. Since electrical resistivity correlates well with soil water content, we used two-dimensional electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) monitoring and time-lapse analyses to supplement punctual measurements by sensors and soil analyses to show soil moisture changes throughout a whole year (2020–2021). While the topsoil dries out significantly from summer to autumn down to a depth of about 3 m, a clear increase in soil water content and a decrease in resistivity below 3 m can be observed during winter period. Anomalies in the topsoil (0–1 m) showing lower resistivities than the surrounding substrate could be related to tree positions by additional terrestrial laser scans. A significant relationship could be found between tree crown projection area and resistivity in 1–2 m depth. We found a trend that mean resistivity below pine is lower as below beech. ERT data were also used to estimate the soil water content via Archie's law and the results correlate strongly with the measured values, but the degree of correlation varies depending on the depth level. ERT as a noninvasive method, in combination with additional data, for example, on the vitality status of individual trees, could help to better understand root water uptake and water supply to trees, especially during periods of drought.},

	abstract = {Abstract The gradual accumulation of phosphorus from historical fertilization can contribute to the eutrophication of surface waters by increasing the potential for subsurface leaching losses. Grazing lands areas are a priority for concern, and phytoremediation efforts in grazing lands have prioritized grasses that may be used as forage for cattle. This study investigated the influence of three different forage species—Paspalum notatum, Hemarthria altissima, and Cynodon nlemfuensis—on the loss of phosphorus in leachate from surface soils. The experiment used a nested pot mesocosm design that allowed us to monitor leachate volume and concentration biweekly over the course of 3 months. Pots containing P. notatum plants leached significantly more phosphorus than pots containing C. nlemfuensis or empty pots with no plants growing in them, despite losing an equivalent amount of water. H. altissima lost equivalent amounts of phosphorus in leachate water, but each H. altissima plant removed approximately 33.6 mg of phosphorus, approximately 2.5× that removed by P. notatum (13.4 mg). C. nlemfuensis had lower average leachate phosphorus concentrations at each biweekly sampling than either plant species (C. nlemfuensis-P. notatum, padj = 0.001; C. nlemfuensis-H. altissima, padj = 0.02), averaging only 0.110 ppm in leachate relative to 0.175 ppm and 0.200 ppm in pots beneath H. altissima and P. notatum, respectively. This, combined with C. nlemfuensis' slightly higher-than-average aboveground P content and overall aboveground biomass expression suggest it is the best possible phytoremediation candidate. As even minor leachate P loads can be critically threatening to neighboring oligotrophic water bodies, if the conservation of downstream environments is the priority, the short-term threat of increased leachate must be considered. Further research is needed to explore the underlying mechanisms and field-scale implications of these findings.},

	abstract = {Summary The functional structure of plant communities can be altered by grazing through two main mechanisms: species turnover (i.e. changes in species occurrence and relative abundance) and intraspecific trait variability (ITV), which is driven by phenotypic responses of individual plants and shifts in the relative abundance of genotypic variants within species. Studies of grassland ecosystem function under grazing often focus on community changes induced by species turnover, which ignores the effects of ITV on biomass productivity, soil carbon or nutrient availability. By quantifying the relative contribution of both effects on shifts in community-wide traits, we highlight the role of ITV in community functional response to grazing and its implications for ecosystem function in Tibetan alpine meadows. We measured three chemical traits (LC: leaf carbon, LN: leaf nitrogen and LP: leaf phosphorus concentrations) and two morphological traits (SLA: specific leaf area, LDMC: leaf dry matter content) that are critical components of plant production and forage quality in grazed and ungrazed plots. Using variance decomposition of community-weighted means (CWM) for these foliar traits, we distinguished the relative importance of ITV vs. change in species occurrence and abundance in response to grazing and the associated changes in soil carbon and nutrient availability. The CWM for foliar nutrients and SLACWM increased in response to grazing together with decreases in soil carbon and nutrient stores, especially LPCWM enrichment and loss of available soil P. The LPCWM was strongly negatively correlated with LDMCCWM, which was significantly higher in ungrazed plots. These community-wide trait responses to grazing were generally best captured by ITV and not changes in species occurrence and abundance, although ITV was consistently correlated with species turnover for all traits. Synthesis and applications. In response to continuous grazing, plants in Tibetan alpine meadows increase specific leaf area and foliar nutrients but tend to have lower leaf dry matter content, a response consistent with faster growth and regrowth under grazing. This intraspecific trait variability response drives a shift in community function from conservative, slow-growing resource use in ungrazed meadows to exploitative resource use under grazing. This community-wide functional response enhances forage quality, in turn favouring the secondary productivity of small herbivorous mammal communities, but also contributes to accelerated depletion of soil available phosphorus.

	abstract = {Abstract Rock moisture in the vadose zone, while recognized as important, is rarely monitored—in part because adequate instrumentation and installation techniques are lacking. The objectives of this work were (a) to test the applicability of a commercially available capacitance soil moisture sensor (EC-5, METER Group) for continuously monitoring the water content of weathered limestone; and (b) to contrast the water dynamics of rock matrix with that of rock fractures. At a site in the Edwards Plateau, Texas, we developed a protocol for installing sensors in limestone pits and tested its effectiveness in reducing erroneous readings caused by installation-induced preferential flow along pit walls. Our results show that rock moisture can be accurately measured with EC-5 sensors, provided some steps are taken to ensure the quality of the installation. These include protecting the sensors by installing them in horizontal shafts rather than on the exposed pit wall, and use of a sealant. Data gathered over 7 mo after installation showed that rock moisture increased significantly only after a 95-mm rainfall event. Because of preferential flow, fractures reached peak water content within 2–3 h after peak rainfall—a response that was one to two orders of magnitude faster than in rock matrix. Limestone stored 40–70\% of the water after the 95-mm event, and its water content decreased significantly during summer months. Overall, our results attest to the importance of continuously measuring rock moisture in regions with shallow soils, where it serves as a critical reservoir for vegetation.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture influences many hydrologic applications including agriculture, land management and flood prediction. Most remote-sensing methods that estimate soil moisture produce coarse resolution patterns, so methods are required to downscale such patterns to the resolutions required by these applications (e.g. 10- to 30-m grid cells). At such resolutions, topography is known to affect soil moisture patterns. Although methods have been proposed to downscale soil moisture based on topography, they usually require the availability of past high-resolution soil moisture patterns from the application region. The objective of this article is to determine whether a single topographic-based downscaling method can be used at multiple locations without relying on detailed local observations. The evaluated downscaling method is developed on the basis of empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of space–time soil moisture data at a reference catchment. The most important EOFs are then estimated from topographic attributes, and the associated expansion coefficients are estimated on the basis of the spatial-average soil moisture. To test the portability of this EOF-based method, it is developed separately using four data sets (Tarrawarra, Tarrawarra 2, Cache la Poudre and Satellite Station), and the relationships that are derived from these data sets to estimate the EOFs and expansion coefficients are compared. In addition, each of these downscaling methods is applied not only for the catchment where it was developed but also to the other three catchments. The results suggest that the EOF downscaling method performs well for the location where it is developed, but its performance degrades when applied to other catchments.

	abstract = {An approach is proposed to estimate soil moisture from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for the Earth Observing System (AMSR-E) 6.9 GHz passive microwave observations. The approach was evaluated over two watersheds in the Mackenzie River Basin in northwestern Canada as a contribution to the Canadian Global Energy and Water Cycle Experiment (GEWEX) study and the Mackenzie GEWEX Study (MAGS). Based on the sensitivity of the emitted microwave signal to soil roughness and vegetation parameters, a two-stage method was applied to calibrate a microwave radiative transfer model. Roughness parameters were determined using observations taken under dry conditions. Vegetation parameters were determined using observations taken under wet conditions. Obtained soil roughness and vegetation parameters were then integrated in the radiative transfer model to retrieve soil moisture. The performances of the proposed approach were evaluated against in situ observations, estimates from the NASA soil moisture product (AMSR-E), model-based soil moisture estimates from the NARR and gauge-based precipitation observations. The lowest RMSE of 0.0254 g/cm3 was obtained between the retrieved soil moisture and in situ soil moisture. But, the RMSE between the NARR estimates and in situ soil moisture was 0.055 g/cm3 and between the NASA AMSR-E product and in situ observation was 0.072 g/cm3. This implies that the proposed approach led to an improvement of 55\% and 72\% in the obtained RMSE over NARR and NASA AMSR-E soil moisture, respectively. It is noteworthy that the proposed approach is expandable to larger watersheds and very appropriate for remote regions like the Mackenzie River Basin where information on roughness and vegetation are scarce.},

	abstract = {Abstract With satellite soil moisture (SM) retrievals becoming widely and continuously available, we aim to develop a method to objectively integrate the drought indices into one that is more accurate and consistently reliable. The data sets used in this paper include the Noah land surface model-based SM estimations, Atmosphere-Land-Exchange-Inverse model-based Evaporative Stress Index, and the satellite SM products from the Advanced Scatterometer, WindSat, Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity, and Soil Moisture Operational Product System. Using the Triple Collocation Error Model (TCEM) to quantify the uncertainties of these data, we developed an optically blended drought index (BDI\_b) that objectively integrates drought estimations with the lowest TCEM-derived root-mean-square-errors in this paper. With respect to the reported drought records and the drought monitoring benchmarks including the U.S. Drought Monitor, the Palmer Drought Severity Index and the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index products, the BDI\_b was compared with the sample average blending drought index (BDI\_s) and the RMSE-weighted average blending drought indices (BDI\_w). Relative to the BDI\_s and the BDI\_w, the BDI\_b performs more consistently with the drought monitoring benchmarks. With respect to the official drought records, the developed BDI\_b shows the best performance on tracking drought development in terms of time evolution and spatial patterns of 2010-Russia, 2011-USA, 2013-New Zealand droughts and other reported agricultural drought occurrences over the 2009–2014 period. These results suggest that model simulations and remotely sensed observations of SM can be objectively translated into useful information for drought monitoring and early warning, in turn can reduce drought risk and impacts.},

	abstract = {Abstract The need for and the use of different data assimilation techniques to improve the quality of streamflow forecast is now well established. In this paper, the goal is to demonstrate the power of a new class of methods known as the forward sensitivity method (FSM) which is based on the temporal evolution of model sensitivities with respect to the control variables consisting of initial conditions and parameters. FSM operates in two phases: the first phase provides a simple algorithm for placing observations at or near where the square of forward sensitivities attains their maximum values. Using only this selected subset of observations in a weighted least squares method, the second phase then provides an estimate of the unknown elements of the control variables. In this paper, FSM based assimilation is applied to a simple class of two parameter model in a medium-sized agriculture dominant watershed lying in the Krishna River Basin, India. Four assimilation scenarios were tested to determine the effect of assimilating only sensitive observations as well as the impact of temporally evolving initial condition sensitivity. Sensitivity results showed that observations during the monsoon time alone are enough for assimilation purposes, which has helped in reducing the computational time greatly. Assimilation and forecast results also indicated that the scenarios which assimilated only sensitive observations are better in estimating daily streamflow. From the obtained results, it is concluded that FSM based assimilation has significant potential to improve the streamflow simulations, especially in places where data availability remains a major challenge.},

	abstract = {In agriculture, soil moisture wireless sensor networks (SMWSNs) are used to monitor the growth of crops for obtaining higher yields. The purpose of this paper is to improve the network efficiency of SMWSNs. Therefore, we propose a novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism which is suitable for soil moisture sensors and design a sensor target allocation model (STAM) for the actual agricultural situation. After that, a quantum clone elite genetic algorithm (QCEGA) is proposed; then, QCEGA is applied to optimize the STAM for obtaining optimal results. QCEGA uses the parallel mechanism of quantum computing to encode individuals, integrates the quantum revolving gate in quantum computing and the concept of cloning in biology to avoid the algorithm from falling into local optimum, and applies the elite strategy to speed up the convergence of the algorithm. Subsequently, the proposed algorithm is compared with simulated annealing (SA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). Under the novel network efficiency evaluation mechanism, the simulation results demonstrate that the network efficiency based on QCEGA is higher than that of SA and PSO; what is more, QCEGA has better convergence performance. In comparison with traditional wireless sensor network efficiency evaluation approaches, our methods are more in line with the development of modern agriculture and can effectively improve the efficiency of SMWSNs, thus ensuring that crops can have a better growth condition.},

	abstract = {Abstract This study demonstrated a new method for mapping high-resolution (spatial: 1 m, and temporal: 1 h) soil moisture by assimilating distributed temperature sensing (DTS) observed soil temperatures at intermediate scales. In order to provide robust soil moisture and property estimates, we first proposed an adaptive particle batch smoother algorithm (APBS). In the APBS, a tuning factor, which can avoid severe particle weight degeneration, is automatically determined by maximizing the reliability of the soil temperature estimates of each batch window. A multiple truth synthetic test was used to demonstrate the APBS can robustly estimate soil moisture and properties using observed soil temperatures at two shallow depths. The APBS algorithm was then applied to DTS data along a 71 m transect, yielding an hourly soil moisture map with meter resolution. Results show the APBS can draw the prior guessed soil hydraulic and thermal properties significantly closer to the field measured reference values. The improved soil properties in turn remove the soil moisture biases between the prior guessed and reference soil moisture, which was particularly noticeable at depth above 20 cm. This high-resolution soil moisture map demonstrates the potential of characterizing soil moisture temporal and spatial variability and reflects patterns consistent with previous studies conducted using intensive point scale soil moisture samples. The intermediate scale high spatial resolution soil moisture information derived from the DTS may facilitate remote sensing soil moisture product calibration and validation. In addition, the APBS algorithm proposed in this study would also be applicable to general hydrological data assimilation problems for robust model state and parameter estimation.},

It uses a split-plot design with two bamboo species (Dendrocalamus asper and Dendrocalamus hamiltonii) and an open field condition as main plots, under which ginger (Zingiber officinale) was grown at five nutrient levels supplied through chemical fertilizers and organic sources (subplots). In the intercropping with bamboo species, ginger yield increased by 10.5–15.6\% in comparison to the open field condition. Application of farmyard manure (FYM) based on N equivalent ratio showed the best (P ≤ .05) yield response of ginger (rhizome length, 7.65 cm; yield, 4,028 kg ha−1). Photoactive radiation was reduced by 60\% under the bamboo canopy. Simultaneously, higher soil moisture (\%) content was noticed for D. asper. Various soil physico-chemical properties (top 0–15 cm) were significantly higher in the FYM treatment under D. asper than under D. hamiltonii or sole ginger cropping. Maximum returns (3,595.67 US\$ ha−1 yr−1) were realized when the ginger crop was raised under the canopy of D. asper and supplied with FYM on N equivalent ratio + plant growth–promoting rhizobacteria. Overall, the results establish that ginger production in the northwest Himalayan region of India is a viable use of land resources for improved economic returns.},

In this study, we tested an existing portable dielectric tube sensor in vertical access tubes together with a set of temperature sensors for the determination of the in situ SFC and SMC. The experiment was conducted at three sites with sandy, loamy, and silt loam soils. At each site, three SFC curves were obtained at depths of 15, 25, and 35 cm. The resulting SMCs estimated from the SFCs were compared with the SMCs determined using a pressure plate apparatus. The data from the proposed method and those of the pressure plate fit the Campbell model with 0.806 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.994 and fit the van Genuchten model with 0.638 ≤ R2 ≤ 0.994. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.837) and RMSE (131 kPa) showed a good agreement between the characteristic curves from the two methods. Thus, we recommend the dielectric tube sensor for determining the SFC in situ and inferring the SMC across depths.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Useful daily drainage estimates obtained from soil moisture measurements at 60 cm. Annual drainage estimates indicate potential recharge rates to groundwater aquifers. Uncertainty in the drainage estimates was relatively high at sites with high precipitation. Groundwater supplies 20\% of global freshwater withdrawals, and accurate information regarding groundwater recharge rates is needed for sustainable groundwater management. Recharge rates are often limited by the rates of drainage from the soil profile, which are influenced by soil moisture conditions. Soil moisture monitoring has expanded dramatically in recent decades with the advent of large-scale networks like the Oklahoma Mesonet, which has monitored soil moisture statewide since 1996. Using those data with site-specific soil hydraulic properties and a unit-gradient assumption, we estimated daily drainage rates at 60 cm for 78 sites for up to 17 yr. Our working hypothesis was that these drainage rates are indicative of potential groundwater recharge rates. Mean annual drainage rates ranged from 6 to 266 mm yr−1, with a statewide median of 67 mm yr−1. These rates agreed well with prior recharge estimates for major Oklahoma aquifers. To provide a further independent check on our results, drainage was modeled using HYDRUS-1D for four focus sites across 17 yr. Soil-moisture-based drainage rates and HYDRUS-1D drainage rates agreed to within 10 mm yr−1 at the drier two sites but had discrepancies of {\textgreater} 150 mm yr−1 at two sites with {\textgreater} 1000 mm yr−1 precipitation. Simulations also showed that for a semiarid site the unit-gradient assumption was likely violated at the 60-cm depth, highlighting the need for deeper soil moisture monitoring. Despite these limitations, this simple method for estimating drainage through long-term soil moisture monitoring shows unique potential to provide valuable information for hydrology and groundwater management.},

	abstract = {The capability to partition evapotranspiration (ET) measurements into two components, namely direct evaporation (E) from soil, leaf, and litter surfaces and transpiration (T) via plants is critical toward better defining hydrological processes along the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Such information has practical applications ranging from water resource management to climate modeling. A recently developed partitioning technique was employed using high frequency measurements of water vapor and carbon dioxide collected by an eddy covariance flux system, which was deployed over a corn (Zea mays L.) field near Beltsville, MD for a full growing season. The partitioning technique is based on flux-variance similarity theory and has the benefit of relying on routinely collected eddy covariance measurements, with no additional instrumentation required. Results showed an increase in the T/ET ratio from ∼5\% during the early portion of the growing season to ∼70–80\% by the time the corn crop reached maturity. This was consistent with observed dynamics of the soil moisture profile, which indicated that water was removed from deeper soil layers as the growing season progressed. The partitioned estimates of T are shown to be useful for the appropriate calculation of canopy conductance, a key variable in land surface models. Finally, the transient impact of rainfall events were examined, in which the suppression of T and enhancement of E were observed for up to several days following rainfall. Insight gained through the partitioning of ET fluxes has the potential to significantly improve the structure and parameterization of land surface hydrological models.},

The monitoring clarified water use characteristics of the trees in arid environments. Dielectric soil moisture sensors have the potential for nondestructive and real-time monitoring of the stem water content (θst) of living trees. This study was conducted to investigate the water use characteristics of trees in drylands through monitoring of θst using newly developed capacitance sensors (GS3). The plants used for data collection were Prosopis juliflora (Sw.) DC. (mesquite, invasive) in Sudan and Tamarix ramosissima Ledeb. (tamarisk, invasive) and Prosopis pubescens Benth.(screwbean mesquite, native) in the United States. The GS3 probes were installed into the trunks of two trees for each species. Stem-specific calibration equations and temperature calibration equations were derived through laboratory experiments and analysis of field observation data. The temperature calibration equations reduced inappropriate variations of θst caused by daily fluctuations in stem temperature, suggesting that these are essential for correct interpretation of monitoring data of θst in arid environments. The θst of the mesquite trees in Sudan clearly increased after heavy rainfall events and started decreasing when the soil water content became close to the wilting point. These findings indicate that mesquite trees use soil water in rainy seasons, even though they are generally considered to use groundwater through deep tap roots. The θst of neither species in the United States responded clearly to rainfall events, indicating that they depend on shallow saline groundwater. The θst of the tamarisk decreased monotonically throughout the monitoring period, apparently in response to feeding damage caused by the tamarisk leaf beetle (Diohabda sp.), which had been released for biological control of tamarisk.},

In the past decade, its potential has increased yearly, with improved receivers and signal processors, from generic GNSS receivers whose signals were recorded in magnetic tapes to instruments that measure full Delay Doppler Maps (the power distribution of the reflected GNSS signal over the 2-D space of delay offsets and Doppler shifts) in real time. At present, these techniques are considered to be promising tools to retrieve geophysical parameters such as soil moisture, vegetation height, topography, altimetry, sea state and ice and snow thickness, among others. This paper focuses on the land geophysical retrievals (topography, vegetation height and soil moisture) performed from a ground-based instrument using the Interference Pattern Technique (IPT). This technique consists of the measurement of the power fluctuations of the interference signal resulting from the simultaneous reception of the direct and the reflected GNSS signals. The latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field is shown in this paper. After a review of the previous results, this paper presents the latest experiment performed using this technique over a maize field. This new study provides a deeper analysis on the soil moisture retrieval by observing three irrigation-drying cycles and comparing them to different depths soil moisture probes. Furthermore, the height of the maize, almost 300 cm, has allowed testing the capabilities of the technique over dense and packed vegetation layers, with high vegetation water content.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Soil Conservation Service curve number (CN) method commonly uses three discrete levels of soil antecedent moisture condition (AMC), defined by the 5-day antecedent rainfall depth, to describe soil moisture prior to a runoff event. However, this way may not adequately represent soil water conditions of fields and watersheds in the Loess Plateau of China. The objectives of this study were: (1) to determine the effective soil moisture depth to which the CN is most related; (2) to evaluate a discrete and a linear relationship between AMC and soil moisture; and (3) to develop an equation between CN and soil moisture to predict runoff better for the climatic and soil conditions of the Loess Plateau of China. The dataset consisted of 10 years of rainfall, runoff and soil moisture measurements from four experimental plots cropped with millet, pasture and potatoes. Results indicate that the standard CN method underestimated runoff depths for 85 of the 98 observed plot-runoff events, with a model efficiency E of only 0·243. For our experimental conditions, the discrete and linear approaches improved runoff estimation, but still underestimated most runoff events, with E values of 0·428 and 0·445 respectively. Based on the measured CN values and soil moisture values in the top 15 cm of the soil, a non-linear equation was developed that predicted runoff better with an E value of 0·779. This modified CN equation was the most appropriate for runoff prediction in the study area, but may need adjustments for local conditions in the Loess Plateau of China.

There is a threshold value of the soil saturation, below and above which the sensitivity of flood peak to the soil moisture differentiates substantially; (2) For model spin-up, streamflow needs longer time to reach the ‘practical’ equilibrium (10\%) than the soil moisture and latent heat flux. The model uncertainty from spin-up can propagate through the hydrometeorological modelling chain and get amplified into the flood peak; (3) For ensemble flood modelling with a hydrometeorological system, modelling uncertainty is dominated by the precipitation forecast.

	abstract = {It is well documented that soil moisture has a strong impact on precipitation forecasts of numerical weather prediction models. Several microwave satellite soil moisture retrieval data products have also been available for applications. However, these observational data products have not been employed in any operational numerical weather or climate prediction models. In this study, a preliminary test of assimilating satellite soil moisture data products from the NOAA-NESDIS Soil Moisture Operational Product System (SMOPS) into the NOAA-NCEP Global Forecast System (GFS) is conducted. Using the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) introduced in recent year publications and implemented in the GFS, the multiple satellite blended daily global soil moisture data from SMOPS for the month of April 2012 are assimilated into the GFS. The forecasts of surface variables, anomaly correlations of isobar heights, and precipitation forecast skills of the GFS with and without the soil moisture data assimilation are assessed. The surface and deep layer soil moisture estimates of the GFS after the satellite soil moisture assimilation are found to have slightly better agreement with the ground soil moisture measurements at dozens of sites across the continental United States (CONUS). Forecasts of surface humidity and air temperature, 500 hPa height anomaly correlations, and the precipitation forecast skill demonstrated certain level of improvements after the soil moisture assimilation against those without the soil moisture assimilation. However, the methodology for the soil moisture data assimilation into operational GFS runs still requires further development efforts and tests.},

Preplant soil samples from the top 15 cm were collected from four long-term tillage experiments at Swift Current, SK; Woodslee, ON; L'Acadie, QC; and Agassiz, BC. Potentially mineralizable N was determined by aerobic incubation at 25°C and periodic leaching for 24 wk. The N0 was greater under NT than under CT, but only at Swift Current. The labile and intermediate mineralizable N pools were significantly higher under NT than under CT at three of the four sites. The stable mineralizable N pool and the mineralization rate coefficient (k) were greater under NT than under CT at only one of the four sites. Adoption of NT influenced the quality of the active organic N fraction at three sites, as indicated by an increased proportion of mineralizable N in the more labile N pools. Among tested indices of N availability, KCl-extractable NH4–N, NaOH-extractable N, Illinois Soil N Test, phosphate-borate buffer extractable N, and particulate organic C were most sensitive to tillage-induced changes in the active organic N fraction. Tillage-induced changes in the size and quality of the active organic N fraction may influence soil N supply and should be considered in optimizing fertilizer N management.},

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture is a key variable that contributes for flux partitioning into sensible and latent heat components. There is a pressing need to study the impacts of shallow groundwater table dynamics on antecedent soil moisture and corresponding feedbacks to atmosphere. In this study, we evaluate WRF-NoahMP simulated soil moisture using two experimental configurations: one with the default, free drainage approach (CTL) and with Miguez-Macho groundwater scheme (GW). Results are presented for the study conducted over Ganga River basin, India between the years 2008 and 2014 for all the three seasons (pre-monsoon, monsoon, post-monsoon). It was observed that the GW model runs, improve soil moisture in topmost and bottom-most layers. We discovered that the simulations improved temporal negative bias of seasonal accumulation during monsoon by around 91 mm. In addition, the average negative bias in latent heat flux improved by around 28 W/m2. Compared to CTL, GW was found to contribute additional atmospheric moisture content ranging between 3\% and 5\%. Comparison with in-situ ground water showed that model overestimates the ground water table depth. This can be attributed to the ability of the model to only simulate natural occurring variabilities and lack of inclusion of anthropogenic factors such as ground water pumping in the model. The groundwater trend in Ganga is declining at alarming rate. In addition, if over exploitation of groundwater is not monitored properly, water and food scarcity is an imminent threat to the country's economy. To the best of authors knowledge, this is the first study of its kind to be implemented over Ganga basin, which evaluates the role of shallow ground water table on regional climate using coupled atmosphere-land surface-groundwater model. In summary, we highlight that the groundwater component along with WRF-NoahMP coupled model improves soil moisture and precipitation representation over the Ganga basin.},

Results show that fusion of the SMA\_CN method causes decrease in runoff volume and increase in profile soil moisture content, associated with larger groundwater contribution to the streamflow. In addition, the higher amount of moisture in the soil profile slightly elevates the actual evapotranspiration. The SMA-based SWAT configuration consistently produces improved goodness-of-fit scores and less uncertain outputs with respect to streamflow during both calibration and validation. The SMA\_CN method exhibits a better match with the observed data for all flow regimes, thereby addressing issues related to peak and low flow predictions by SWAT in many past studies. Comparison of the calibrated model outputs with field-scale soil moisture observations reveals that the SMA overhauling enables SWAT to represent soil moisture condition more accurately, with better response to the incident rainfall dynamics. While the results from the modification of the CN method in SWAT are promising, more studies including watersheds with various physical and climatic settings are needed to validate the proposed approach.

	abstract = {Abstract A mesoscale convective system (MCS) case study was observed over northeast Mali as part of the African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (AMMA) on 31 July 2006. Observations of this case suggest that the soil-moisture heterogeneity and atmospheric gravity waves emitted from a ‘parent’ MCS were important trigger mechanisms for this system. This study uses high-resolution Met Office Unified Model (MetUM) simulations to assess the importance of the synoptic circulation, land-surface and gravity waves in the initiation and development of the MCS. During the early afternoon shallow convection developed over a region of dry soil within a synoptic-scale convergence zone, which was caused by the confluence of the southerly monsoon flow with winds associated with the circulation around the Saharan heat low. Two pronounced waves were emitted from a nearby ‘parent’ storm and propagated towards the convergence zone. When the second wave reached the location of the shallow convection, deep convection was immediately initiated. Further convective cells developed later in the afternoon over dry soil, many adjacent to strong soil moisture gradients; these aggregated with the main storm, which later developed into the case study MCS. A comparison of model simulations with/without the soil-moisture heterogeneity and gravity waves shows that the synoptic-scale circulation and convergence zones, specified by the atmospheric analysis, were the most important factors for the successful simulation of the MCS. If the location of the initiation of the system is to be forecast accurately, the land-surface, that is, the soil moisture, must be represented adequately. In order to reproduce the timing of the secondary initiation of convection correctly the model must be able to capture gravity waves that are emitted by existing systems.},

These estimates are useful for modeling, data assimilation, and calibration of satellite products. Many studies have used the neutron detector for other applications; results have been promising. Since the introduction of the cosmic-ray neutron method for soil moisture estimation, numerous studies have been conducted to test and advance the accuracy of the method. Almost 200 stationary neutron detector systems have been installed worldwide, and roving systems have also started to gain ground. The intensity of low-energy neutrons produced by cosmic rays, measured above the ground surface, is sensitive to soil moisture in the upper decimeters of the ground within a radius of hectometers. The method has been proven suitable for estimating soil moisture for a wide range of land covers and soil types and has been used for hydrological modeling, data assimilation, and calibration and validation of satellite products. The method is challenged by the effect on neutron intensity of other hydrogen pools such as vegetation, canopy interception, and snow. Identifying the signal of the different pools can be used to improve the cosmic-ray neutron soil moisture method as well as extend the application to, e.g., biomass and canopy interception surveying. More fundamental research is required for advancement of the method to include more energy ranges and consider multiple height levels.},

The emergence of wireless sensor networks has effectively solved the problems existing in radio technology, but traditional wireless sensor networks and radio technology networks cannot be directly applied to wireless sensors. On this basis, this paper studies the remote sensing of soil nutrient variability in agricultural land using wireless sensors. Due to traditional farmland management and agricultural systems, farmland soil nutrient variability has led to polarization: fertile soil has excess nutrients, reducing the use rate of chemical fertilizers and polluting high-quality farmland. Traditional farming methods can no longer meet the requirements, and modern technology must be used to comprehensively understand the spatiotemporal variability of soil nutrients during plant growth. Remote sensing technology has the advantages of accuracy, speed, economy, and regular monitoring. It provides new ideas and technical guarantees for soil quality evaluation in land development and consolidation projects. This paper also studies the use of statistical quantitative evaluation technology to carry out multidimensional statistical quantification of soil protection function evaluation at a given location. Finally, wireless sensor networks are used to analyze the relationship between several natural factors and quantitative estimation of soil protection. Based on wireless sensor technology, this paper studies the variability of farmland soil nutrients and statistical quantitative evaluation, hoping to lay a foundation for the development of agriculture and statistics.},

Strip width and length were 18.3 m and 605 to 660 m, respectively. Initial soil samples were taken from 0.3-ha cells and post-harvest samples were taken each year by treatment (0.1-ha cells). High N (for corn) and K rates were applied uniformly across all strips. Manure P increased strip-average grain yield (P ≤ 0.05) in eight of nine site-years but yield for FR and VR did not differ. The study of yield responses for field areas with different STP showed that manure P always increased yield with STP very low or low ({\textless}16 mg Bray-P1 kg−1) and only in three site-years with STP optimum (16–20 mg P kg−1). Yield responses differed between FR and VR in very low areas of one site-year, where VR increased corn yield more than FR. The VR method reduced within-field STP variability compared with FR with the exception of only one site-year. Although VR did not increase yield compared with FR, less manure P was applied to high-testing areas and it reduced STP variability.},

	abstract = {Abstract Land surface models and satellite remote sensing are among the modern soil moisture retrieval techniques that can be used over large areas. However, the lack of ‘ground truth’ soil moisture measurements is still an obstacle in the evaluation and validation of soil moisture retrievals. In this study, a new scheme is used to assess soil moisture retrieval from both the NOAH Land surface Model (LSM) coupled with the fifth generation Mesoscale Model MM5 and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer AMSR-E. The proposed scheme is based on the strong correlation between changes in soil storage from rainfall runoff events and changes in the retrieved soil moisture either from the MM5-NOAH LSM or the AMSR-E. The aim of this study is to compare the application of the proposed scheme between these two different approaches for soil moisture estimation. The MM5-NOAH LSM provides soil moisture estimations at three different layers with depths 0–10 cm (surface layer 1), 10–40 cm (layer 2) and 40–100 cm (layer 3). In this study, the combined soil moisture over the top two layers (first and second) and the combined soil moisture over the first three layers (first, second and third) are used to account for the entire soil column for assessing the estimated soil moisture using changes in the storage from the water balance. The results have shown that the MM5 soil moisture from the combined top two layers has the better performance than either of the individual layers when compared to the catchment water storage. The results also show that the MM5-NOAH LSM soil moisture estimates have a slightly better performance than the AMSR-E surface soil moisture measurement. This preliminary assessment shows the benefits of using hydrological data in the validation of soil moisture retrieval methods. Copyright © 2013 Royal Meteorological Society},

The Illinois soil N test (ISNT) has shown promise in some regions as a useful tool for estimating mineralizable soil N; however, the procedure needs to be modified for use in routine soil testing labs that must process hundreds of samples per day. The assay determines alkali hydrolyzable N by treating 1 g of soil with 10 mL of 2 mol L−1 NaOH in a 473-mL wide-mouth Ball jar, and heating for 5 h at 50°C on a hot plate to liberate (NH4+ + amino sugar)–N as gaseous NH3, which is collected in H3BO3 solution and subsequently determined by acidimetric titration. The objectives of this study were to determine if variance in measurement values could be reduced and sample throughput increased while maintaining accuracy by using an incubator to replace the hot plate as the heat source. Thirty-five soils collected from N-response trials in Virginia were used in this study. Jars were heated in an incubator at 50°C for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or 15 h. Soil samples were also analyzed with the unmodified method for comparison. All determinations were conducted in triplicate. Use of an incubator set to 50°C reduced the total recovery of N from the samples, but increasing the diffusion period increased N recovery. The 15-h diffusion period resulted in quantitative recovery of ISNT-N with significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) improved measurement precision compared with the unmodified method (CV = 4.3 vs. 7.4, respectively). Modifying the ISNT by using an incubator instead of a hot plate increases measurement precision and allows greater sample throughput.},

A previous paper described how variable soil moisture profiles affect the integrated cosmic-ray neutron signal from which depth-average soil moisture is computed. Here, we investigate the effect of horizontal heterogeneity on the relationship between neutron counts and average soil moisture. Observations from a distributed sensor network at a site in southern Arizona indicate that the horizontal component of the total variance of the soil moisture field is less variably in time than the vertical component. Using results from neutron particle transport simulations we show that 1-D binary distributions of soil moisture may affect both the mean and variance of neutron counts of a cosmic-ray neutron detector placed arbitrarily in a soil moisture field, potentially giving rise to an underestimate of the footprint average soil moisture. Similar simulations that used 1-D and 2-D Gaussian soil moisture fields indicate consistent mean and variances of a randomly placed detector if the correlation length scales are short (less than ∼30 m) and/or the soil moisture field variance is small ({\textless}0.032 m6 m−6). Taken together, these soil moisture observations and neutron transport simulations show that horizontal heterogeneity likely has a small effect on the relationship between mean neutron counts and average soil moisture for soils under natural conditions.},

However, the reliability and accuracy of both modeled and remotely sensed soil moisture require comparison with ground measurements at the appropriate spatiotemporal scales. One promising technique is the cosmic ray neutron probe. Here we further assess the suitability of this technique for real-time monitoring across a large area by combining data from three fixed probes and roving surveys over a 12 km × 12 km area in eastern Nebraska. Regression analyses indicated linear relationships between the fixed probe averages and roving estimates of soil moisture for each grid cell, allowing us to derive an 8 h product at spatial resolutions of 1, 3, and 12 km, with root-mean-square error of 3\%, 1.8\%, and 0.9\%.},

	abstract = {Surface ground-penetrating radar (GPR) techniques have been used by a number of previous researchers to characterize soil moisture content in the vadose zone. However, limited temporal sampling and low resolution near the surface in these studies greatly impedes the quantitative analysis of vertical soil moisture distribution and its associated dynamics within the shallow subsurface. To further examine the capacity of surface GPR, we have undertaken an extensive 26 month field study using concurrent high-frequency (i.e., 900 MHz) reflection profiling and common-midpoint (CMP) soundings to quantitatively monitor soil moisture distribution and dynamics within the shallow vadose zone. This unprecedented data set allowed us to assess the concurrent use of these techniques over two contrasting annual cycles of soil conditions. Reflection profiles provided high-resolution traveltime data between four stratigraphic reflection events while cumulative results of the CMP sounding data set produced precise depth estimates for those reflecting interfaces, which were used to convert interval-traveltime data into soil moisture. The downward propagation of major infiltration episodes associated with seasonal and transient events are well resolved by the GPR data. The use of CMP soundings permitted the determination of direct ground wave velocities, which provided high-resolution information along the air-soil interface. This improved resolution enabled better characterization of short-duration wetting/drying and freezing/thawing processes, and permitted better evaluation of the nature of the coupling between shallow and deep moisture conditions. The nature of transient infiltration pulses, evapotranspiration episodes, and deep drainage patterns observed in the GPR data series were further examined by comparing them with a vertical soil moisture flow simulation based on the variably saturated model, HYDRUS-1D. Using laboratory-derived soil hydraulic property information from soil samples and a number of simplifying assumptions about the upper and lower-boundary condition, we were able to achieve very good agreement between measured and simulated soil moisture profiles without model calibration; this is a strong indication of the overall quality of the GPR-derived soil moisture estimates. The only notable difference between simulated values and GPR water content estimates occurred during extended dry soil conditions near the surface.},

Some methods used in integrated systems, like winter grazing on cropland, could negatively affect soil properties and crop productivity. We compared soil compaction, corn (Zea mays L.) yield, and soil nutrient pools between an integrated crop–livestock system and continuous corn system to address this issue. The study was conducted near Pana, IL, between 2002 and 2006. Soil compaction was evaluated indirectly by measuring soil penetration resistance (PR) and surface CO2 effluxes. Total soil C, N, and microbial biomass C, were measured from 2002 to 2005. Soil PR and CO2 effluxes showed inconsistent trends related to soil compaction and cattle presence. Corn yield from 2004 to 2006 was higher (P = 0.01) in the integrated system (11.6 Mg ha−1) compared with continuous corn (10.6 Mg ha−1). Total soil C concentration increased significantly from 2002 to 2005 within components of the integrated system but remained unchanged in continuous corn. Microbial biomass C was also higher in the integrated system but only in 2005. The study determined that integration of crops with livestock had generally positive effects on crop yield and soil organic matter despite the potential for livestock to compact soil during winter grazing.},

Furthermore, to fully capture the hydrologic effects of nonuniform precipitation, a representation of soil moisture heterogeneity and distribution of spatially varying precipitation must exist within the same framework. For this study, the explicit and sampling methods of Sellers et al. (2007) are tested off-line using the Simple Biosphere Model (SiB3) in an arid, semiarid, and wet site, and are numerically compared to the bulk method, which is currently used in GCMs. To carry out the numerical experiments, an arbitrary grid area was defined by (1) a single instance of SiB3 (bulk method), (2) 100 instances of SiB3 (explicit method), and (3) less than 100 instances of SiB3 (sampling method). Precipitation was randomly distributed over fractions of the grid area for the explicit and sampling methods, while the standard SiB3 exponential distribution relating precipitation intensity to the grid area wet fraction was used in the bulk method. Comparing the sampling and bulk method to the explicit method indicates that 10 instances of SiB3 in the sampling method better captures the spatial variability in soil moisture and grid area flux calculations produced by the explicit method, and deals realistically with spatially varying precipitation at little additional computational cost to the bulk method.},

It is well known that the surface soil moisture content (SMC) affects soil reflectance at all solar spectrum wavelengths. Therefore, future satellite missions, such as the NASA Surface Biology and Geology mission, will be essential for mapping and monitoring global soil moisture changes. Our study compares two widely used moisture retrieval models: the multilayer radiative transfer model of soil reflectance (MARMIT) and the soil water parametric (SWAP)-Hapke model. We evaluated the SMC retrieval accuracy of these models using unmanned aerial systems (UAS) hyperspectral imagery and goniometer hyperspectral data. Laboratory analysis employed hyperspectral goniometer data of sediment samples from four locations reflecting diverse environments, while field validation used hyperspectral UAS imaging and coordinated ground truth collected in 2018 and 2019 from a barrier island beach at the Virginia Coast Reserve Long-Term Ecological Research site. The (SWAP)-Hapke model achieves comparable accuracy to MARMIT using laboratory hyperspectral data but is less accurate when applied to UAS hyperspectral imagery than the MARMIT model. We proposed a modified version of the (SWAP)-Hapke model, which achieves better results than MARMIT when applied to laboratory spectral measurements; however, MARMIT's performance is still more accurate when applied to UAS imagery. These results are likely due to differences in the models' descriptions of multiply-scattered light and MARMIT's more detailed description of air-water interactions.},

Two forms of regressors are implemented: 1) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation flux and 2) the linear regressors of SSM and precipitation flux with an additional interaction term. Regression results based on 3 years of global SMAP and GPM data show that the unified regression method can identify the SSM characteristics found by several recent studies, including the SSM exponential decay rate, the fraction of precipitation retained in the surface soil layer, and the effective depth of hydrologic storage. Additionally, including the interaction regressor provides a novel way to derive the sensitivity of infiltration/runoff partitioning to antecedent SSM without the need for streamflow observations. These SMAP/GPM regression results are compared with those derived from a global SSM data set simulated by the variable infiltration capacity model. Relative to the satellite data, variable infiltration capacity retains moisture longer in the top layer, retains too much precipitation input in that layer, and exhibits levels of sensitivity of runoff/infiltration partitioning to top-layer soil moisture that generally match SMAP especially in humid regions. This study demonstrates that the regression-based method can recover useful process-level insight from SMAP SSM retrievals and is a viable tool for evaluating the representation of surface processes in hydrologic models.},

	abstract = {Abstract Mineralization and nitrification are the key processes of the global N cycle and are primarily driven by microorganisms. However, it remains largely unknown about the consequence of intensified agricultural activity on microbial N transformation in agricultural soils. In this study, the 15N-dilution technique was carried out to investigate the gross mineralization and nitrification in soils from a long-term field fertilization experiment starting from 1988. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) analysis was used to determine soil microbial communities, e.g., biomasses of anaerobic bacterial, bacterial, fungi, and actinobacteria. The abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA) were measured using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results have demonstrated significant stimulation of gross mineralization in the chemical-fertilizers treatment (NPK) ([6.53 ± 1.29] mg N kg–1 d–1) and chemical fertilizers–plus–straw treatment (NPK+S1) soils ([8.13 ± 1.68] mg N kg–1 d–1) but not in chemical fertilizers–plus–two times straw treatment (NPK+S2) soil when compared to the control-treatment (CK) soil ([3.62 ± 0.86] mg N kg–1 d–1). The increase of anaerobic bacterial biomass is up to 6-fold in the NPK+S2 compared to that in the CK soil ([0.7 ± 0.5] nmol g–1), implying that exceptionally high abundance of anaerobic bacteria may inhibit gross mineralization to some extent. The gross nitrification shows upward trends in the NPK+S1 and NPK+S2 soils. However, it is only significantly higher in the NPK soil ([5.56 ± 0.51] mg N kg–1 d–1) compared to that in the CK soil ([3.70 ± 0.47] mg N kg–1 d–1) (p {\textless} 0.05). The AOB abundance increased from (0.28 ± 0.07) × 106 copies (g soil)–1 for the CK treatment to (4.79 ± 1.23) × 106 copies (g soil)–1 for the NPK treatment after the 22-year fertilization. In contrast, the AOA abundance was not significantly different among all treatment soils. The changes of AOB were well paralleled by gross nitrification activity (gross nitrification rate = 0.263 AOB + 0.047 NH{\textbackslash} \_4{\textasciicircum}+ {\textbackslash}-N + 2.434, R{\textless}?h.3{\textgreater}2 = 0.73, p {\textless} 0.05), suggesting the predominance of bacterial ammonia oxidation in the fertilized fields.},

	abstract = {Surface soil moisture content is highly variable in both space and time. While remote sensing provides an effective methodology for mapping surface moisture content over large areas, it averages within-pixel variability thereby masking the underlying heterogeneity observed at the land surface. This variability must be better understood in order to rigorously evaluate sensor performance and to enhance the utility of the larger-scale remotely sensed averages by quantifying the underlying variability that remote sensing cannot record explicitly. In support of the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology Experiment (a surface soil moisture mapping mission conducted between June 18 and July 17, 1997, in central Oklahoma) an investigation was conducted to characterize soil moisture variability within remote sensing footprints (approximately 0.64 km2) with more certainty than would be afforded with conventional gravimetric moisture content sampling. Nearly every day during the experiment period, portable impedance probes were used to intensively monitor volumetric moisture content in the 0- to 6-cm surface soil layer at six footprint-sized fields scattered over the SGP97 study area. A minimum of 49 daily moisture content measurements were made on most fields. Higher-resolution grid and transect data were also collected periodically. In total, more than 11,000 impedance probe measurements of volumetric moisture content were made at the six sites by over 35 SGP97 participants. The wide spatial distribution of the sites, combined with the intensive, near-daily monitoring, provided a unique opportunity (relative to previous smaller-scale and shorter-duration soil moisture studies) to characterize variations in surface moisture content over a range of wetness conditions. In this paper the range and temporal dynamics of the variability in moisture content within each of the six fields are described, as are general relationships between the variability and footprint-mean moisture content. Results indicate that distinct differences in mean moisture content between the six sites are consistent with variations in soil type, vegetation cover, and rainfall gradients. Within fields the standard deviation, coefficient of variation, skewness, and kurtosis increased with decreasing moisture content; the distribution of surface moisture content evolved from negatively skewed/nonnormal under very wet conditions, to normal in the midrange of mean moisture content, to positively skewed/nonnormal under dry conditions; and agricultural practices of row tilling and terracing were shown to exert a major control on observed moisture content variations. Results presented here can be utilized to better evaluate sensor performance, to extrapolate estimates of subgrid-scale variations in moisture content across the entire SGP97 region, and in the parameterization of soil moisture dynamics in hydrological and land surface models.},

Practices that reduce fertilizer inputs without sacrificing turfgrass quality are needed, but a reliable test of N status in turfgrass is not currently available.

Amino sugar N does not fluctuate as rapidly as other forms of N in soil. Our objective is to determine the spatial variation of amino sugar N in soil to determine sampling frequency requirements for use of the Illinois soil N test as a management tool on golf course fairways. Soil samples from 0 to 15, 15 to 30, and 30 to 45 cm were collected from golf course fairways in Minnesota and analyzed for amino sugar N concentration. Our data indicate that amino sugar N concentration decreases with depth but is not correlated to the concentration in the 0 to 15 cm layer. Amino sugar N concentrations measured on the four sampled fairways varied, but the spatial correlation present would allow for traditional soil sampling techniques to be used to assess the soil amino sugar N concentration within an area such as a golf course fairway.},

The preliminary results of the proposed algorithm are evaluated by station observations and other reanalysis products. The downscaled results are more consistent with the in situ observations, the Land Data Assimilation System (CLDAS) from China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) than the original SMAP product.

	abstract = {Agricultural production depends on the consumption of nitrogen fertilizers, which are mostly produced by artificially fixing inert atmospheric N2 gas. Crops assimilate a fraction of the applied nitrogen (N) on farmlands, and the residual inorganic N in the soil solution is lost to the atmosphere and oceans, contributing to global climate change, water pollution and eutrophication. There is worldwide evidence indicating that N-fertilizers are overused beyond profit-maximizing levels, leading to dramatically low nitrogen use efficiencies. In this study, we focus on the problem of residual nitrogen accumulation on farmlands and the role of information feedback on fertilizer application rates. The vehicle is dynamic simulation and decision experimentation. Results of pilot experiments with students reveal that annual information feedback on farm profits and residual N help subjects adjust their rates towards economically meaningful quantities that do not create superfluous N losses. Because in real life, cause-and-effect between fertilizer rates and crop yields is confounded by various environmental factors, timely information on residual N may serve as a better cue for informing farmers' fertilizer decisions. When applied to farmer communities, the simulator is expected to facilitate learning about soil N accumulation and create the missing incentive for implementing regular soil analysis likely to lead towards more appropriate fertilizer rates.

Herein, this work presents a high-performance multi-parameter sensor based on vanadium oxide (VOX)-doped laser-induced graphene (LIG) foam to completely decouple nitrogen oxides (NOX) and temperature. The highly porous 3D VOX-doped LIG foam composite is readily obtained by laser scribing vanadium sulfide (V5S8)-doped block copolymer and phenolic resin self-assembled films. The heterojunction formed at the LIG/VOX interface provides the sensor with enhanced response to NOX and an ultralow limit of detection of 3 ppb (theoretical estimate of 451 ppt) at room temperature. The sensor also exhibits a wide detection range, fast response/recovery, good selectivity, and stability over 16 days. Meanwhile, the sensor can accurately detect temperature over a wide linear range of 10–110 °C. The encapsulation of the sensor with a soft membrane further allows for temperature sensing without being affected by NOX. The unencapsulated sensor operated at elevated temperature removes the influences of relative humidity and temperature variations for accurate NOX measurements. The capability to decouple nitrogen loss and soil temperature paves the way for the development of future multimodal decoupled electronics for precision agriculture and health monitoring.},

	abstract = {Effective hydraulic parameters of soil–vegetation–atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models can be derived by inverting observed surface soil moisture, θobs, and evapotranspiration, ETobs, retrieved from remote sensing. We investigated the uncertainties in simulating the water fluxes of contrasting hydroclimatic scenarios for which it was assumed that θobs had a RMSE of 0.04 m3 m−3 (Δθobs) and ETobs had a relative error of 20\% (ΔETobs). The correlation of the uncertainties in the simulated water fluxes (ΔWFsim) with Δθobs and ΔETobs was derived with the proposed Uncertainty Simulator Algorithm. The results show that ΔWFsim is influenced by climate and increases when the climate is drier. The uncertainty in estimated root-zone θ was found to be correlated with Δθobs. The prediction of evaporation contained large uncertainties and was correlated with the actual/potential evapotranspiration ratio. The uncertainties in transpiration under dry climates were high and were correlated with ΔETobs; however, the uncertainty under wet climates was insignificant. The uncertainties in groundwater recharge under dry climates were large but were reduced under wet climates. Furthermore, uncertainties in groundwater recharge were correlated with ΔETobs but not with Δθobs. In general, the ΔWFsim increases as (i) climate gets drier, (ii) texture gets coarser, or (iii) roots grow deeper. The uncertainty in recharge is explained by soil moisture and transpiration decoupling. Soil moisture decoupling occurs when the information provided by surface θ is no longer representative of root-zone θ. Transpiration decoupling occurs when there is substantially more water storage at depth. We propose methodology to reduce the nonuniqueness of the inverted hydraulic parameters.},

	abstract = {Current restoration efforts for the Chesapeake Bay watershed mandate a timeline for reducing the load of nutrients and sediment into receiving waters. The Chesapeake Bay watershed model (WSM) has been used for two decades to simulate hydrology and nutrient and sediment transport; however, spatial limitations of the WSM preclude edge-of-field scale representation of phosphorus (P) losses. Rather, the WSM relies on literature-derived, county-scale rates of P loss (targets) for simulated land uses. An independent field-scale modeling tool, Annual Phosphorus Loss Estimator (APLE), was used as an alternative to the current WSM approach. Identical assumptions of county-level acreage, soil properties, nutrient management practices, and transport factors from the WSM were used as inputs to APLE. Incorporation of APLE P-loss estimates resulted in greater estimated total P loss and a revised spatial pattern of P loss compared with the WSM's original targets. Subsequently, APLE's revised estimates for P loss were substituted into the WSM and resulted in improved WSM calibration performance at up to 79\% of tributary monitoring stations. The incorporation of APLE into the WSM will improve its ability to assess P loss and the impact of field management on Chesapeake Bay water quality. Core Ideas APLE estimated P losses were compared with the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Model's (WSM) losses. Substituting the APLE estimated P loss into the WSM improved calibration performance. Findings suggest the importance of well-estimated transport factors in modeling P losses.},

Links among satellite-derived rainfall (Climate Hazards group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data, CHIRPS), sea surface temperature (Hadley Centre Sea ice and Sea Surface Temperature, HadISST1-SST), soil moisture (Climate Change Initiative, CCI-SM), and dynamical variables (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Re-Analysis, ERA-Interim) are investigated to disentangle their specific role in shaping the rainfall variability over the region. In general, interannual rainfall variability is highest in the area during OND. Empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is applied to the rainfall dataset to extract the dominant spatial and temporal patterns of variability. Results show that the rainfall variability is directly influenced by the SST variability in the Indian Ocean (Indian Ocean Dipole, IOD) and in the Pacific Ocean (El Niño–Southern Oscillation, ENSO), and by the local SM. The strong positive correlation (0.78) between EA short rain index and the IOD index indicates that the positive-phase IOD (IOD+) plays a dominant role in driving OND rainfall. Moreover, IOD+ usually coincides with El Niño events and becomes stronger as the intensity of El Niño increases for years of joint events, and the Walker circulation is shifted accordingly. Furthermore, El Niño alone brings a reduction of rainfall over EA. The physical mechanism explaining the IOD+ link to EA rainfall consists of a Gill-type response to warm western Indian Ocean SST anomalies that induces anomalous low-level easterlies over the IO and leads to moisture convergence over EA. In general, the response of rainfall is opposite during the negative phase of the events (IOD− and La Niña).},

Two sites were selected: (1) the Agricultural Research Institute of Jinhua (ARI) where soil is calcareous and (2) the Shimen Research Farm (SM) where soil is acidic. Eight consecutive crops were grown (1997–2000) in ARI and five consecutive crops (1998–2000) at SM. Treatments included unfertilized control (CK) and three different fertilizer treatments (NP, NK, and NPK). Potassium extracted by ion-exchange resin decreased from 26 mg kg–1 to 5–10 mg kg–1 after eight consecutive seasons of growth at the ARI site. Addition of 100 kg K ha–1 for each rice crop was not enough to maintain initial K availability, especially in the calcareous soil at ARI site. In treatments with K, a small increase in readily available K was observed only in SM soil. The K extracted by HNO3 also decreased significantly in the treatments without K addition and was increased slightly in the treatments with K application. In the NP treatment, the decrease in HNO3-K was several times greater than resin-K, indicating that nonexchangeable K may be the major source of K supply to rice. Soil K depletion was greater for hybrid rice than for inbred rice, and this difference in K demand should be taken into account in developing fertilizer recommendations for irrigated rice.},

Then, considering that the crop is moderately sensitive to soil salinity, the model is tested to predict the salt distribution around a buried emitter, when two different water qualities (i.e. electrical conductivity of 1.0 and 4.0 dS m-1) are used during the growing season (treatments T1 and T2). Finally, the soil volume in which salt accumulates is distinguished by the model for the two treatments, for which the respective yields are not significantly different. The results showed that in the root zone, simulated and measured soil water content (SWC) are fairly close. HYDRUS-2D well enough predicts the average salt concentration in the soil and evaluates the dynamic of mass-conservative solutes around buried emitters. In both treatments, the salt concentration resulted in an increase in the wetting bulb, with a maximum located towards the edge of the wetting bulb and near the soil surface.

	abstract = {Enrichment of soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks through sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in agricultural soils is important because of its impacts on soil quality, agronomic production, and adaptation to and mitigation of climate change. In a 21-yr field experiment conducted under subhumid tropical conditions in India, the impacts of crop residue C inputs were assessed for the rice (Oryza sativa L.)–lentil (Lens esculenta Moench) cropping sequence. These impacts were evaluated in an experiment involving mineral fertilizers and manuring treatments on crop yield sustainability with reference to critical biomass requirements for maintenance of SOC in an Inceptisol. Application of farmyard manure (FYM) without and with mineral fertilizers increased C input and SOC concentration and stock. In comparison with the control, the 100\% organic (FYM) treatment had significantly higher profile SOC (27.5 Mg ha−1), and more C build up (55.0\%) and C sequestration (6.6 Mg C ha−1) to 1-m depth vis-à-vis the antecedent values in 1986. These parameters were also higher in 100\% FYM treatment at a rate providing equivalent amount of the recommended dose of N followed by conjunctive use of FYM and mineral fertilizers. The SOC stock and rate of sequestration were positively correlated with cumulative C input, and with sustainable yield index (SYI) of upland rice and lentil. Higher grain yield (1.95 and 1.04 Mg ha−1 of rice and lentil, respectively) was obtained with the application of 50\% organic (FYM)+50\% recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF). In comparison, higher SOC sequestration rate was measured with the application of 100\% organic (FYM). For every Mg increase in SOC stock in the root zone there was 0.16 and 0.18 Mg ha−1yr−1 yield increase of rice and lentil, respectively. For maintaining a stable SOC level (zero change due to cropping), a minimum quantity of 2.47 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 is required for this soil, climate, cropping system, and fertilization treatments. To achieve this quantity of C, 7.1 Mg of biomass is required to be produced every year vs. average rice and lentil yields of 1.6 and 0.7 Mg ha−1, respectively. The sole application of mineral fertilizers at 50 or 100\% of the RDF did not maintain the SOC stock. Thus, application of FYM (or other organics) in conjunction with mineral fertilizers is essential to maintaining and enhancing the SOC stock in the rice-based cropping systems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Various remote-sensing methods are available to estimate soil moisture, but few address the fine spatial resolutions (e.g. 30-m grid cells) and root-zone depth requirements of agricultural and other similar applications. One approach that has been previously proposed to estimate fine-resolution soil moisture is to first estimate the evaporative fraction from an energy balance that is inferred from optical and thermal remote-sensing images [e.g. using the Remote Sensing of Evapotranspiration (ReSET) algorithm] and then estimate soil moisture through an empirical relationship to evaporative fraction. A similar approach has also been proposed to estimate the degree of saturation. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate these methods for estimating soil moisture and degree of saturation, particularly for a semi-arid grassland with relatively dry conditions. Soil moisture was monitored at 28 field locations in south-eastern Colorado with herbaceous vegetation during the summer months of 3 years. In situ soil moisture and degree of saturation observations are compared with estimates calculated from Landsat imagery using the ReSET algorithm. The in situ observations suggest that the empirical relationships with evaporative fraction that have been proposed in previous studies typically provide overestimates of soil moisture and degree of saturation in this region. However, calibrated functions produce estimates with an accuracy that may be adequate for various applications. The estimates produced by this approach are more reliable for degree of saturation than for soil moisture, and the method is more successful at identifying temporal variability than spatial variability in degree of saturation for this region.

A 2-yr study evaluated a grass-selective herbicide (GSH) applied in late March to a pure rye cover and a vetch–rye mixture, allowing the vetch to accumulate N until early May.

Corn grain yield was greater following pure stands of vetch than following any other cover crop treatment, regardless of kill date. The average economic optimum FN rate was about 150 kg N ha−1 without a cover. With a cover crop and compared to the control, the hairy vetch replaced about 80 kg FN ha−1, the vetch–rye mixture replaced about 15 kg FN ha−1, while the pure rye removed an additional 50 kg FN ha−1.

	abstract = {Abstract Soil nitrogen (N) is controlled by several environmental factors. However, it is unclear how these factors and their interactions affect soil N fractions (SNFs) because of the lack of systematic N extraction methods. The Harbin–Dali belt, a transect more than 3,300 km long across China covering various climates, topographies, soil parent materials and vegetation types, was taken as the study area, and the interactive effects on SNFs in largely undisturbed woodlands and grasslands were explored using three SNFs: labile N, moderately stable N and stable N. The soil N fractions were obtained through a novel sequential extraction method that used distilled H2O, 0.5 M CaCl2, 1 M HCl, 6 M HCl, mixed acid (1 M HCl and 5 M HF; MA), concentrated HCl (cHCl) and concentrated H2SO4 as extractive agents to successively separate H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl-, 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N fractions. The results showed that increasing mean annual temperature (MAT) directly decreased the concentrations of H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N, suggesting that warming may reduce available N. The interactions between MAT, parent material, aspect and aridity index also contributed to the three SNFs. Vegetation and its interactions with parent material primarily controlled 6 M HCl-, cHCl- and RES-N, and climate and topography had indirect effects during these processes. Particularly, more cHCl- and RES-N were accumulated in areas with warm humid climates and rich vegetation species than in other environments. Moreover, soil labile N (H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N) and cHCl-N exhibited potential as sensitive indicators for reflecting the changes in MAT and vegetation, respectively. Therefore, the various interactions between climate and other environmental factors controlled the changes in most SNFs. This novel sequential extraction method thus offers a reliable analytical approach to measuring SNFs. Highlights Soil nitrogen fractions (SNFs) were fractionated via a novel sequential extraction method. Increasing MAT decreased the H2O-, CaCl2- and 1 M HCl-N concentrations. Interactions of climate, parent material and vegetation affected 6 M HCl-, MA-, cHCl- and RES-N. H2O-, CaCl2-, 1 M HCl- and cHCl-N are sensitive SNFs that reflect environmental changes.},

Limited knowledge of soil moisture recharge in these systems hinders sand stabilization efforts. To increase the understanding of soil moisture response to rainfall, we analysed soil water transport in the desert vadose zone of sand dunes and dune slacks following four natural rainfall events during the growing season of 2017. Rainfall was dominated by small rain events ({\textless}5.0 mm), accounting for 58\% of total rainfall events. Soil moisture at 5–25 cm depth in dune slacks was significantly higher and more variable to 60 cm depth than in sand dunes. Soil moisture at 5 cm depth was replenished with rainfall amounts of {\textless}5 mm in dune slacks, but not in sand dunes. When rainfall amount reached 20 mm, soil moisture in dune slack and in sand dune increased, but was much higher in dune slack than in sand dune at depth of 5 cm; after the rain, soil moisture remained at a relatively high level in dune slack but not in sand dune. This was possible because dune slacks had higher silt contents and root biomass, which played a key role in improving soil water holding capacity or accelerating rainfall infiltration at 0–25 cm depth. Overall, the rainfall-driven hydrological regime coupled with soil physical factors regulated spatial and temporal variability of soil moisture in a sand dune system.},

	abstract = {Abstract Recently, recurrent deep networks have shown promise to harness newly available satellite-sensed data for long-term soil moisture projections. However, to be useful in forecasting, deep networks must also provide uncertainty estimates. Here we evaluated Monte Carlo dropout with an input-dependent data noise term (MCD+N), an efficient uncertainty estimation framework originally developed in computer vision, for hydrologic time series predictions. MCD+N simultaneously estimates a heteroscedastic input-dependent data noise term (a trained error model attributable to observational noise) and a network weight uncertainty term (attributable to insufficiently constrained model parameters). Although MCD+N has appealing features, many heuristic approximations were employed during its derivation, and rigorous evaluations and evidence of its asserted capability to detect dissimilarity were lacking. To address this, we provided an in-depth evaluation of the scheme's potential and limitations. We showed that for reproducing soil moisture dynamics recorded by the Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) mission, MCD+N indeed gave a good estimate of predictive error, provided that we tuned a hyperparameter and used a representative training data set. The input-dependent term responded strongly to observational noise, while the model term clearly acted as a detector for physiographic dissimilarity from the training data, behaving as intended. However, when the training and test data were characteristically different, the input-dependent term could be misled, undermining its reliability. Additionally, due to the data-driven nature of the model, data noise also influences network weight uncertainty, and therefore the two uncertainty terms are correlated. Overall, this approach has promise, but care is needed to interpret the results.},

Soil moisture sensors that are deployed in major monitoring networks were included in the study, along with new and emerging technologies, such as the Cosmic Ray Soil Moisture Observing System (COSMOS), passive/active distributed temperature sensing (DTS), and global positioning system reflectometers (GPSR). Four profile stations were installed in May of 2010, and soil moisture was monitored to a depth of 1 m on an hourly basis. The four stations were distributed within a circular domain of approximately 600 m diameter, adequate to encompass the sensing range of COSMOS. The sensors included in the base station configuration included the Stevens Water Hydra Probe, Campbell Scientific 616 and 229, Decagon EC-TM, Delta-T Theta Probe, Acclima, and Sentek EnviroSMART capacitance system. In addition, the Pico TRIME system and additional time-domain reflectometry (TDR) systems were deployed when available. It was necessary to apply site-specific calibration to most sensors to reach an RMSE below 0.04 m3 m−3. For most sensor types, a single near surface sensor could be scaled to represent the areal-average of a field domain by simple linear regression, resulting in RMSE values around 0.03 m3 m−3.},

	abstract = {Abstract Remote sensing indices (RSIs) are essential for detection, mapping and monitoring of floods, soil moisture and tree characteristics. An understanding of the nexus between flood-recharged soil moisture (FRSM) and endangered biodiversity tree hotspots in semi-arid floodplains is critical. Specifically, the influence of FRSM on biophysical characteristics of keystone tree species with social, economic, ecological and environmental functions is crucial. However, the use of RSIs to understand the link between episodic floods, FRSM and trees, as well as their respective spatiotemporal dynamics within the semi-arid floodplains, remains largely unexplored. Hence, this study reviewed literature on the adoption of RSIs in understanding short-term phenological and long-term tree structural changes arising from flood-related infiltration. The reviewed literature shows the predominance of the normalised difference water index, the land surface water index and normalised difference vegetation index for flood, FRSM and tree mapping. The review also shows the emergence of SAR-based normalised difference flood index for understanding the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees. Although the review identified an increase in data availability, however, there are high costs of active commercial remote sensing data of superior quality and computing resources. Furthermore, available free data are incapable of penetrating canopies and have coarse spatial resolution constraining the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on trees. In view of increasing free SAR data and cloud-based computing resources, application of emerging deep learning algorithms offers prospects for the use of RSIs to understand the impacts of FRSM on riparian trees.},

Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to measure temperature with a spatial resolution of a few centimeters over several kilometers, which can be used to measure soil moisture. This study is the first of its kind that investigates under field conditions the feasibility of combining the Dual-Probe Heat-Pulse (DPHP) technique with the DTS technology to measure soil thermal properties and variation in soil moisture. A field experiment was conducted over a 30 m transect in the Lake Wheeler Field laboratory in Raleigh, NC. Three different DPHP sensors were constructed from combinations of different fiber optic cables and heating elements and were tested to assess their performance and the effect of their construction characteristics on their accuracy. Measurements were taken over different soil moisture conditions and the system performance was compared against independent soil water content sensors. The system was able to track changes in soil water content with a mean RMSE of 0.02 m3 m−3 using the optimal DPHP sensor. The key advantage of the tested system is that it does not need any site-specific calibrations typically required for other DTS-based systems. The findings of this study provide some practical information and measures that need to be taken for successful DTS-DPHP construction and application under field conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Information on water balance components such as evapotranspiration and groundwater recharge are crucial for water management. Due to differences in physical conditions, but also due to limited budgets, there is not one universal best practice, but a wide range of different methods with specific advantages and disadvantages. In this study, we propose an approach to quantify actual evapotranspiration, groundwater recharge and water inflow, i.e. precipitation and irrigation, that considers the specific conditions of irrigated agriculture in warm, arid environments. This approach does not require direct measurements of precipitation or irrigation quantities and is therefore suitable for sites with an uncertain data basis. For this purpose, we combine soil moisture and energy balance monitoring, remote sensing data analysis and numerical modelling using Hydrus. Energy balance data and routine weather data serve to estimate ET0. Surface reflectance data from satellite images (Sentinel-2) are used to derive leaf area indices, which help to partition ET0 into energy limited evaporation and transpiration. Subsequently, first approximations of water inflow are derived based on observed soil moisture changes. These inflow estimates are used in a series of forward simulations that produce initial estimates of drainage and ETact, which in turn help improve the estimate of water inflow. Finally, the improved inflow estimates are incorporated into the model and then a parameter optimization is performed using the observed soil moisture as the reference figure. Forward simulations with calibrated soil parameters result in final estimates for ETact and groundwater recharge. The presented method is applied to an agricultural test site with a crop rotation of cotton and wheat in Punjab, Pakistan. The final model results, with an RMSE of 2.2\% in volumetric water content, suggest a cumulative ETact and groundwater recharge of 769 and 297 mm over a period of 281 days, respectively. The total estimated water inflow accounts for 946 mm, of which 77\% originates from irrigation.},

	abstract = {Abstract The consistent determination of soil moisture across scales is a persistent challenge in hydrology. Several measurement methods exist at distinct scales, each of which is challenging in terms of data processing, removal of vegetation and surface effects, and calibration. While in situ measurements are trusted at the point scale, distributed sensor networks extend the areal representation to the field scale. At this scale, also cosmic ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has become an established method to derive volume-averaged, root zone soil moisture over several tens of hectometers, but the signal is often biased due to biomass water. With airborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) remote sensing, it is possible to cover regional scales, but the method is limited to the topmost soil layer and sensitive to vegetation parameters. In this study, the performance and synergistic potential of these complementary methods is investigated for the determination of soil moisture within a 55 km2 Alpine foothill river catchment in Southern Germany. The individual approaches are evaluated and brought into synergy for a 9 ha grassland and several other locations within the catchment. The results indicate that the sensor network data provide valuable information to calibrate the mobile CRNS rover, and to optimize the vegetation removal within the polarimetric SAR retrieval algorithm. The root-mean-square errors for polarimetric SAR soil permittivity are 9.32 with the standard agriculture approach, 4.29 with the semi-stand-alone approach, and 0.31 with the sensor network optimized approach. Furthermore, the CRNS soil moisture product was improved by considering the remotely sensed cross-polarized backscatter product as a biomass water proxy.},

The purpose of this study was to develop a method to predict soil P concentrations by visual and near-infrared spectroscopy using reference P concentrations determined by diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT); Olsen P results were included for comparison. The study was conducted on paddy soils from six main rice-producing (Oryza sativa L.) provinces in southern China. Using DGT P as a reference resulted in a better visual and near-infrared calibration to predict soil P concentrations, as compared with using Olsen P. Core Ideas Determining soil P by Vis-NIR spectroscopy is possible. Using DGT P as the reference method is superior to using Olsen P.

	abstract = {Abstract Understanding the phosphate oxygen isotope (δ18O-PO4) composition of bedrock phosphate sources is becoming ever more important, especially in areas of soil research which use this isotope signature as a proxy for biological cycling of phosphorus (P). For many of these studies, obtaining a sample of the source bedrock or applied mineral fertiliser for isotope analysis is impossible; meaning there is now a demand for a comprehensive characterisation of global bedrock δ18O-PO4 to support this work. Here we compile δ18O-PO4 data from a wide range of global bedrocks, including 56 new values produced as part of this study and a comprehensive overview of those within the previously existing literature. We present δ18O-PO4 data from the range of major phosphatic lithologies alongside as much metadata for the samples as could be gathered. Much of the data comes from bedrocks of marine sedimentary origin ({\textless} 1 Ma = {\textgreater} +22‰, {\textgreater} 540 Ma = ≈ +12‰), but we also present data from bedrocks associated with guano (range: +19.5 to +15‰) and igneous deposits (range: +12 to –0.8‰), both of which have distinct δ18O-PO4 signatures due to their formation mechanisms. We show that where repeat measurements of the same formation have been undertaken, regardless of method or exact sample location, there is an average within formation error of ± 1.25‰. This is important, as is constitutes a reasonable level of uncertainty for phosphorus cycling studies which need to estimate bedrock δ18O-PO4 composition based on the literature. In combination, this data set presents 284 δ18O-PO4 values from 56 countries; a comprehensive starting point for researchers interested in understanding bedrock end member δ18O-PO4.},

	abstract = {Abstract Surface soil moisture (SSM) has a considerable impact on land-atmosphere exchanges of water and energy fluxes. However, due to the inherent deficiencies of remotely sensed data (e.g., cloud contamination in thermal remote sensing and coarse resolutions for microwave remote sensing), none of the current algorithms alone can provide daily and seamless field-scale (30 m) SSM information. To fill the gap, we proposed a novel SSM fusion framework to Generate high Resolution, Accurate, Seamless data using Point-Surface fusion (GRASPS) based on remotely sensed, reanalysis, and in-situ data sets. First, 30 m seamless continuous SSM correlated variables (land surface temperature, NDVI, and albedo) were downscaled by enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model. Then, downscaled auxiliary variables and other background variables were input into a deep learning model to produce 30 m daily and seamless SSM fields. To further improve the SSM estimation accuracy, a pixel classification-based bias correction method was developed. The GRASPS method was validated over an in situ soil moisture sensor network (HOAL network) in Austria. The average Pearson correlation coefficient, root mean square error (RMSE), unbiased RMSE (ubRMSE), bias, and mean absolute error (MAE) over all validation sites achieved 0.78, 0.048, 0.033, −0.001, and 0.041 , respectively. After bias correction, RMSE, ubRMSE, bias, and MAE decreased by 13\%, 7\%, 22\%, and 18\%, respectively. The proposed method maximizes the potential of data fusion and deep learning in generating field-scale seamless SSM, which is promising for fine-scale studies and applications in agricultural, hydrological, and environmental domains.},

Therefore, comparisons between observed and simulated RWR reveal where models are unable to capture a realistic soil moisture-heat flux relationship. The results show that in general, models simulate dry spell ET dynamics well in arid zones while decreases in evaporative fraction appear excessive in some models in continental climate zones.

	abstract = {Abstract In the Wadi Laba spate irrigation system, sorghum and maize crops complete their growth period (September to April) mainly based on the soil moisture stored during the flood season from 15 June to 15 August. For the past 100 years, the farmers have strived to divert the unpredictable and destructive floods and irrigate their fields three to four times (irrigation gift is 50 cm each time) so as to harvest 4.5 t ha−1 yr−1 of sorghum or sorghum and maize. Simultaneously, to realize fair water sharing, the farmers introduced two water rights and rules: (1) a field is entitled to a second, third or fourth turn only after all other fields have received one, two or three turns respectively; (2) upstream fields have a priority right to the medium floods (≤50 m3 s−1), the midstream and downstream fields to the moderately large and large (50–200 m3 s−1), and very large (200–265 m3 s−1) floods respectively. These water rights and rules were regularly observed in the indigenous systems when farmers relied on each other for the timely maintenance of the earthen/brushwood structures that frequently failed, but are being violated following the introduction of the concrete structures in 2000. The Soil Water Accounting Model (SWAM) that has been developed as part of the study on which this paper is based revealed that when a field receives two, three or four turns, the soil moisture at the onset of the planting season remains the same, namely 67.5, 72 and 77.5 cm if the field gets its last turn by 15 July, 30 July and 15 August respectively. These results were validated with the more complex Soil Water Atmosphere Plant Model (SWAP). Even the 67.5 cm water depth (with some 120 mm contribution from rainfall), sufficiently supports the said yield. Unlike in the indigenous system, when the fields usually received a third turn by the end of the flood season, the concrete structures of the modern system have made it possible for the upstream farmers to irrigate three or even four times by July. Thus, to maintain fairness of water sharing, the water rights on the size of floods would have to be modified to: regardless of the flood size, if upstream fields are irrigated twice or three times by 15–30 July, the subsequent floods would have to be conveyed to the midstream/downstream fields.

	abstract = {Abstract A theory of maximum entropy production (MEP) for electromagnetic wave propagation in dielectric materials is proposed and applied to simultaneously retrieving soil moisture (SM) and vegetation water content (VWC) from L-band microwave brightness temperature (TB). One representation of the MEP principle states that a non-equilibrium system corresponds to such a configuration of energy fluxes that minimizes a dissipation function under the constraint of energy conservation. The dissipation function for radiative transfer is formulated as an analogy of that for heat transfer. A new physical parameter, radiative inertia as an analogy of thermal inertia, is introduced to characterize radiative attenuation in dielectric media. The radiative inertia is parameterized in terms of the penetration depth of electromagnetic waves as a function of the complex dielectric constant. The MEP based retrieval algorithm predicts SM and VWC by minimizing the dissipation function under the constraint of the conservation of radiative energy. The retrievals of SM and VWC based on the MEP theory were validated against field observations in tropical and temperate forested regions of the Amazon and North America. The proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates the capability of the MEP algorithm for simultaneous retrievals of SM and VWC even for dense canopy (e.g., VWC {\textgreater} 5 kg m−2). The MEP method is a new theoretical framework for developing innovative remote sensing algorithms of the Earth system not limited to microwave observations.},

Focusing on the fact that water content and conductivity depend on soil impedance, our group has been developing a new compact and noise-resistant driving circuit that measured soil impedance by detecting transient characteristics of the voltage obtained by injecting current through the soil and converting it to frequency information. In order to realize agricultural field measurements with sensors using this new driving circuit, it had been necessary to miniaturize the part that detected the output from the driving circuit, but it hadn't been achieved in our previous work. In this research, a microcomputer-based frequency counter was developed to downsize the system for on-site measurement. In general, there are two methods of frequency measurement: direct counting and reciprocal. The direct-counting method is suited for high-frequency measurements, while the reciprocal method is suited for low-frequency measurements. The developed frequency counter could measure with an error of 0.005\% over the assumed frequency range by switching between those two measurement methods according to the measured frequency. Using this driving circuit and frequency counter, we measured the model soil and succeeded in capturing changes in water content as changes in impedance.},

Temporal stability analysis (TSA) is a valuable tool for identifying a small number of representative sampling points to estimate the grid-mean soil moisture content. This analysis was evaluated and improved using high-quality surface soil moisture data that were acquired by a wireless sensor network in a high-intensity irrigated agricultural landscape in an arid region of northwestern China. The performance of the TSA was limited in areas where the representative error was dominated by random events, such as irrigation events. This shortcoming can be effectively mitigated by using a stratified TSA (STSA) method, proposed in this paper. In addition, the following methods were proposed for rapidly and efficiently identifying representative sampling points when using TSA. (1) Instantaneous measurements can be used to identify representative sampling points to some extent; however, the error resulting from this method is significant when validating remotely sensed soil moisture products. Thus, additional representative sampling points should be considered to reduce this error. (2) The calibration period can be determined from the time span of the full range of the grid-mean soil moisture content during the monitoring period. (3) The representative error is sensitive to the number of calibration sampling points, especially when only a few representative sampling points are used. Multiple sampling points are recommended to reduce data loss and improve the likelihood of representativeness at two scales.},

In this study, we investigated how the soil microbial community affects root zone productivity in winter wheat. We also verified whether productivity can be improved by water adjustment and N management in drip irrigation field experiments (I0, natural condition; I1, jointing to heading stage S1 55\%–80\%θf, field capacity, anthesis to mature stage S2 70\%–80\%θf; I2, S1 55\%–90\%θf, S2 70\%–90\%θf; and I3, S1 55\%–100\%θf, S2 70\%–100\%θf) and under different N application rates (N0, N1, N2, and N3 represent 0, 150, 200, and 250 kg N ha−1). Soil moisture and N application rate significantly influenced water use efficiency (WUE), N use efficiency (NUE), yield, and soil bacterial abundance and diversity in the wheat root zone. N application decreased the richness indices in un-irrigated soils (I0), whereas it initially increased, and then decreased the indices in irrigated soils (I1, I2, and I3). The primary factor influencing the dominant bacterial taxa was soil moisture content (SMC), followed by root length density (RLD). The root system and soil bacterial diversity strong influenced wheat yield. The I1N1 treatment resulted in the highest root weight density (RWD), WUE, and NUE, and thus increased wheat yield; furthermore, it had the least influence on the diversity of soil bacteria. Our work suggests that the response of bacterial communities to soil moisture and nitrogen content largely regulates crop production in agro-ecosystems, and that regulating soil moisture and nitrogen fertilizer use may provide a sustainable solution for maintaining farmland productivity.},

	abstract = {Abstract Interactions between the land and atmosphere play an important role in the precipitation of the Sahel. The African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis Special Observing Period provided observations with which to illuminate potential feedback mechanisms. This case-study highlights a major storm which developed over northern Mali in an area where a research aircraft was surveying the atmospheric response to soil moisture features. Soil moisture variability is characterized using satellite land-surface temperature data whilst cloud images illustrate the evolution of the storm and its relationship to the surface. Measurements in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) indicate mesoscale variations in pre-storm humidity and temperature consistent with high evaporation from wet soils. The storm developed above a dry surface within a wetter region with cells first appearing along a wet–dry soil boundary. This suggests that the storm was triggered in association with low-level convergence driven by the soil moisture pattern. A gravity wave propagating away from a remote mature storm also appears to have played an important role in the initiation, though only in the region of the soil moisture contrast did deep convection become established. Once organised into a Mesoscale Convective System, convection developed over wet areas as well as dry, and indeed at this stage, convection became more intense over wetter soils. This behaviour is consistent with the large gradients in PBL humidity. The study illustrates the complexity of soil moisture–convection feedback loops and highlights the mechanisms which may operate at different stages of a storm's life cycle.

For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water, developing smart irrigation systems based on the internet of things (IoT) is essential for scheduling irrigation based on crop water requirements. In this study, an IoT-based irrigation system was developed and evaluated inside a greenhouse located in the experimental fields of Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Central Institute of Agricultural Engineering (ICAR-CIAE), Bhopal, India. Data on microenvironmental parameters such as temperature, relative humidity, light intensity, soil temperature and soil moisture were collected from the sensors developed inside the greenhouse. Soil moisture was predicted based on the field data collected via different machine learning techniques, such as the decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), multiple linear regression (MLR), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), K-nearest neighbour (KNN) and artificial neural network (ANN) methods, with three input combinations. The ANN (coefficient of determination [R2] = 0.942, 0.939) models performed well but were found to be less effective than the RF (R2 = 0.991, 0.951) and XGB (R2 = 0.997, 0.941) models in the training and testing phases, respectively. The RF and XGB models outperformed the other models, while the MLR (R2 = 0.955, 0.875) technique underperformed. With respect to both the testing and training datasets, the models trained with all four inputs outperformed the models trained with two or three inputs.},

	abstract = {Pixel-based effective soil hydraulic parameters are crucial inputs for large-scale hydroclimatic modeling. In this paper, we extend/apply a genetic algorithm (GA) approach for estimating these parameters at the scale of an airborne remote sensing (RS) footprint. To estimate these parameters, we used a time series of near-surface RS soil moisture data to invert a physically based soil-water-atmosphere-plant (SWAP) model with a (multipopulated) modified-microGA. Uncertainties in the solutions were examined in two ways: (1) by solving the inverse problem under various combinations of modeling conditions in a respective way; and (2) the same as the first method but the inverse solutions were determined in a collective way aimed at finding the robust solutions for all the modeling conditions (ensembles). A cross validation of the derived soil hydraulic parameters was done to check their effectiveness for all the modeling conditions used. For our case studies, we considered three electronically scanned thinned array radiometer (ESTAR) footprints in Oklahoma and four polarimetric scanning radiometer (PSR) footprints in Iowa during the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP97) Hydrology Experiment and Soil Moisture Experiment 2002 (SMEX02) campaigns, respectively. The results clearly showed the promising potentials of near-surface RS soil moisture data combined with inverse modeling for determining average soil hydrologic properties at the footprint scale. Our cross validation showed that parameters derived by method 1 under water table (bottom boundary) conditions are applicable also for free-draining conditions. However, parameters derived under free-draining conditions generally produced too wet near-surface soil moisture when applied under water table conditions. Method 2, on the other hand, produced robust parameter sets applicable for all modeling conditions used. These results were validated using distributed in situ soil moisture and soil hydraulic properties measurements, and texture-based data from the UNSODA database. In this study, we conclude that inverse modeling of RS soil moisture data is a promising approach for parameter estimation at large measurement support scale. Nevertheless, the derived effective soil hydraulic parameters are subject to the uncertainties of remotely sensed soil moisture data and from the assumptions used in the soil-water-atmosphere-plant modeling. Method 2 provides a flexible framework for accounting these sources of uncertainties in the inverse estimation of large-scale soil hydraulic properties. We have illustrated this flexibility by combining multiple data sources and various modeling conditions in our large-scale inverse modeling.},

	abstract = {Abstract Root proliferation and greater uptake per unit of root in the nutrient-rich zones are often considered to be compensatory responses. This study aimed to examine the influence of plant phosphorus (P) status and P distribution in the root zone on root P acquisition and root and shoot growth of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in a split-root soil culture. One compartment (A) was supplied with either 4 or 14 mg P (kg soil)–1, whereas the adjoining compartment (B) had 4 mg P kg–1 with a vertical high-P strip (44 mg kg–1) at 90–110 mm from the plant. Three weeks after growing in the split-root system, plants with 4 mg P kg–1 (low-P plants) started to show stimulatory root growth in the high-P strip. Two weeks later, root dry weight and length density in the high-P strip were significantly greater for the low-P plants than for the plants with 14 mg P (kg soil)–1. However, after 8 weeks of growth in the split-root system, the two P treatments of compartment A had similar root growth in the high-P strip of compartment B. The study also showed that shoot P concentrations in the low-P plants were 0.6–0.8 mg g–1 compared with 1.7–1.9 mg g–1 in the 14 mg P kg–1 plants after 3 and 5 weeks of growth, but were similar (1.1–1.4 mg g–1) between the two plants by week 8. The low-P plants had lower root P concentration in both compartments than those with 14 mg P kg–1 throughout the three harvests. The findings may indicate that root proliferation and P acquisition under heterogeneous conditions are influenced by shoot P status (internal) and soil P distribution (external). There were no differences in the total root and shoot dry weight between the two P treatments at weeks 3 and 5 because enhanced root growth and P uptake in the high-P strip by the low-P plants were compensated by reduced root growth elsewhere. In contrast, total plant growth and total root and shoot P contents were greater in the 14 mg P kg–1 soil than in the low-P soil at week 8. The two P treatments did not affect the ratio of root to shoot dry weight with time. The results suggest that root proliferation and greater P uptake in the P-enriched zone may meet the demand for P by P-deficient plants only for a limited period of time.},

	abstract = {The influence of antecedent soil moisture on North American monsoon system (NAMS) precipitation variability was explored using the MM5 mesoscale model coupled with the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) land surface model. Sensitivity experiments were performed with extreme wet and dry initial soil moisture conditions for both the 1984 wet monsoon year and the 1989 dry year. The MM5-VIC model reproduced the key features of NAMS in 1984 and 1989 especially over northwestern Mexico. Our modeling results indicate that the land surface has memory of the initial soil wetness prescribed at the onset of the monsoon that persists over most of the region well into the monsoon season (e.g. until August). However, in contrast to the classical thermal contrast concept, where wetter soils lead to cooler surface temperatures, less land-sea thermal contrast, weaker monsoon circulations and less precipitation, the coupled model consistently demonstrated a positive soil moisture – precipitation feedback. Specifically, anomalously wet pre-monsoon soil moisture always lead to enhanced monsoon precipitation, and the reverse was also true. Both the large-scale circulation change and local land-atmospheric interactions in response to pre-monsoon soil moisture anomalies play important roles in the coupled model's positive soil moisture – monsoon precipitation feedback. However, the former may be sensitive to the strength and location of the thermal anomalies, thus leaving open the possibility of both positive and negative soil moisture – precipitation feedbacks. Furthermore, our use of a regional model with prescribed large-scale circulation at the model boundaries leaves open the possibility that the model behavior may, to some extent, reflect its limited ability to adjust its large-scale circulation to the regional thermal changes.},

We assess spatial and temporal trends of drought over the Brazilian semiarid region by combining soil moisture observations from 360 stations, root zone soil moisture from a leading land surface model, and a vegetation health index from remote sensing. The soil moisture dataset was obtained from the network of stations maintained by the National Center of Monitoring and Early Warning of Natural Disasters (Cemaden), in Brazil. Soil water content at 10 to 35 cm depth, for the period 1979–2018, was obtained from running the JULES land surface model (the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator). The modelled soil moisture was correlated with measurements in the common period of 2015–2018, resulting in an average correlation coefficient of 0.48 across the domain. The standardized soil moisture anomaly (SMA) was calculated for the long-term modelled soil moisture and revealed strong negative values during well-known drought periods in the region, especially during El-Niño years. The performance of SMA in identifying droughts during the first 2 months of the raining and cropping season was similar to the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), commonly used for drought assessment: 12–14 events were identified by both indices. Finally, the temporal relationship between both SMA and SPI with the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) was assessed using the cross-wavelet transform. The results indicated lagged correlations of 1 to 1.5 months in the annual scale, suggesting that negative trends in SMA and SPI can be an early warning to yield losses during the growing season. Public policies on drought assessment should consider the combination of multiple drought indices, including soil moisture anomaly.},

Calibration curves of six hazardous metals (Cr, As, Se, Cd, Hg, and Pb) measured from the soil certified reference materials JSAC 0461 to 0466 were compared with the water content changed from 0 to 30 mass\%. The inclinations of calibration curves of six metals decreased with the increase of the water content. In addition, the XRF intensities of six metals decreased about 15\%–20\% by adding the water in 30 mass\%. It was revealed that the soil moisture effect is caused by two factors as a decrease of the amount of analyte in the XRF generating area, and a change in the sample matrix due to increase of water contents. Thus, a new correction method using the combination between Compton scattered X-rays and the water contents was applied to overcome the soil moisture effect. Applying the proposed correction method, calibration curves of six metals with different water content gave identical inclinations of calibration curves. The analytical results of chromium in the geochemical reference sample were in good agreement with the standard value even with increased water content.},

This study validated Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer E (AMSR-E) soil moisture data with the Common Land Model (CLM), one of the most widely used LSMs, and ground-based measurements at two Korean regional flux monitoring network sites. There was reasonable agreement regarding the different soil moisture products for monitoring temporal trends except National Snow and Ice Data Centre (NSIDC) AMSR-E soil moisture, albeit there were essential comparison limitations by different spatial scales and soil depths. The AMSR-E soil moisture data published by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (VUA) showed potential to replicate temporal variability patterns (root-mean-square errors = 0·10–0·14 m3 m−3 and wet BIAS = 0·09 − 0·04 m3 m−3) with the CLM and ground-based measurements. However, the NSIDC AMSR-E soil moisture was problematic because of the extremely low temporal variability and the VUA AMSR-E soil moisture was relatively inaccurate in Gwangneung site characterized by complex geophysical conditions. Additional evaluations should be required to facilitate the use of recent and forthcoming remotely sensed soil moisture data from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity and Soil Moisture Active and Passive missions at representative future validation sites.

	abstract = {Abstract Soil moisture is a consideration for soil conservation, agricultural production and climate modelling. This article presents a simple method for estimating soil moisture storage under water stress and storage depletion conditions. The method is driven by the common agro-hydrologic variables of precipitation (PPT), irrigation (IRR) and evapotranspiration (ET). The proposed method is successfully tested for the 152 000 km2 floodplain region of Hai River Basin using 48 consecutive months (2003–2006) of data. Soil moisture data from global land data assimilation system/Noah land surface model are validated with ground-truth data from 102 soil moisture monitoring sites. The validated soil moisture is used in combination with in situ groundwater data to quantify total water storage change (TWSC) in the region. The estimated storage change is in turn compared with gravity recovery and climate experiment-derived TWSC for the study area. The soil moisture and TWSC terms show favourable agreements, with discrepancies of {\textless} 10\% on the average. While there is no consistent seasonal trend in soil moisture, TWSC shows a strong seasonality. It is low in spring and high in summer. This trend corresponds with the IRR–PPT season in the study area. Change in groundwater and total water storage indicates storage depletion in the basin. Storage depletion in the region is driven mainly by groundwater IRR and ET loss. Despite the low PPT and high ET, there is narrowing seasonal trend in soil moisture. This is achieved at the expense of groundwater storage. IRR pumping has induced extensive groundwater depletion in the basin. It is therefore vital to develop cultivation strategies that aim at limiting IRR pumping and ET loss. Water management practices that not only reduce waste but also ensure high productivity and ecological sustainability could also mitigate storage depletion in the region. These measures could reduce further not only the seasonal trend in soil moisture but also that in groundwater storage. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

A five-season (June 2013–October 2015) field experiment was conducted using N fertilizer rates of 0, 86, 172 and 258 kg ha−1 during the summer maize growing season, and 0, 105, 210 and 315 kg ha−1 during the winter wheat growing season. Soil NR increased sharply as N rates rose, but soil moisture storage decreased. Summer maize under the high N treatment suffered from increased NR levels and low soil water at the vegetative stage. The dry matter levels increased as the N supply rose during the wheat season. When the N application rate was below 210 and 172 kg N ha−1 for wheat and maize, respectively, yield increased as the N application rose, but excessive N applications negatively affected maize and wheat grain yields. NUE decreased significantly as time progressed and N rates increased. The most appropriate N rates were 172 kg N ha−1 for maize and 210 kg N ha−1 for wheat, which led to relatively good soil moisture uptake and NR conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract Better managing crop : weed competition in cropping systems while reducing both nitrogen and herbicide inputs is a real challenge that requires a better understanding of crop and weed root architecture in relation to soil-nitrogen availability. An original approach was used which considered the parameters of a simulation model of root architecture as traits to analyse (a) the interspecific diversity of root system architecture, and (b) its response to soil-nitrogen availability. Two greenhouse experiments were conducted using three crop and nine weed species grown at two contrasted concentrations of soil-nitrogen availability. Plant traits were measured to characterise both overall plant growth and root architecture, with a focus on primary root emergence, root elongation and branching. The studied root traits varied among species (from a twofold to a fourfold factor, depending on the trait), validating their use as indicators to analyse the interspecific variability of root architecture. The largest interspecies differences were for two traits: ‘maximal apical root diameter’ and ‘interbranch distance’ (distance between two successive laterals on the same root). Conversely, most of the studied root traits varied little with soil-nitrogen availability (from no variation to a 1.1-fold factor, depending on the trait) even though soil-nitrogen availability varied with a 17-fold factor and impacted the overall shoot and root biomass. So, the root traits used in this article are stable whatever soil-nitrogen availability. As they reflect processes underlying root system architecture, this low effect of nitrogen suggests that the rules governing root architecture are little affected by plant nitrogen status and soil-nitrogen availability. We propose that the determinants of differences in root system architecture between soils with contrasted nitrogen availability mainly originate from differences in the amount of carbon allocated to and within the root system. Characterising each plant species by a combination of root traits gave insights regarding the potential species competitive ability for soil resources in agroecosystems.},

	abstract = {Abstract Pigeon pea is cultivated by most smallholder crop–livestock farmers mainly as a border crop. It is quite often sparsely intercropped in cereal-based cropping systems in the subhumid zone of Ghana. Management of pigeon pea and its biomass is a promising means of improving many abandoned arable fields but has not been consciously undertaken. The objective of this trial was to explore the use of pigeon pea and the management of its pruned biomass as part of an improved fallow for crop–livestock farming. Three pigeon-pea management options and a natural fallow (two-year fallow period) were compared in terms of maize grain yield and changes in soil organic carbon, total nitrogen and cation exchange capacity. Pigeon pea grain yield ranged between 615 and 678 kg ha−1 and 527 and 573 kg ha−1 in the first and second year of fallow, respectively. In the first year after fallow, maize grain yield ranged between 0·43 and 2·39 t ha−1 and was significantly influenced by the fallow system. There was a marked decrease in maize grain on the pigeon pea fallow plots in the second year, ranging between 50 and 38·6 per cent in Kumayili and between 42·6 and 17·6 per cent in Tingoli. After the two-year fallow period, increase of soil organic carbon on the pigeon pea fallow plot compared with the natural fallow plot was 30·5 per cent, and there was an improvement of total nitrogen (48·5 per cent) and CEC (17·8 per cent).

	abstract = {Abstract Improvements in the efficiency of water use in Australian vineyards have included a move away from diffuse or ‘total cover’ irrigation techniques to drip irrigation systems. This change in irrigation method has a significant effect on moisture distribution within the soil profile, with implications for root growth, root-system architecture, and soil-water acquisition. Those issues are addressed in this paper. Our report is based on grapevines that had been established under a diffuse irrigation system (overhead sprinklers or microjets) and subsequently converted to drippers. Results are also presented to show the influence of soils with different water holding capacities on root distribution within a single vineyard. Variations in soil texture within a vineyard were found to influence the vertical distribution of roots, whereas irrigation history had more influence on horizontal variations in root density within a depth range. Conversion of vines from sprinkler irrigation to drippers resulted in a marked increase in total root mass (volume) under the drip line, particularly 25–50 cm below the surface. Roots were differentially influenced by irrigation history according to their diameter class. Under drip irrigation, the largest increase in root-length density occurred with roots in diameter classes between 1 and 4 mm diameter. Grapevines established under sprinklers, and subsequently converted to drip irrigation, had significantly larger root systems (within the volume of soil sampled) than did vines maintained under sprinklers throughout. Therefore, vines established under sprinkler irrigation and then converted to drippers may be better equipped to cope with deficit irrigation during drought (via either RDI or PRD), by virtue of those additional roots.},

The Common Land Model (CLM) reasonably replicated soil moisture patterns in dry down and wetting after rainfall though it had modest wet biases (0.001–0.054 m3/m3) as compared to AMSR-E and ground data. While the AMSR-E average soil moisture agreed well with the other data sources, it had extremely low temporal variability, especially during the growing season from May to October. The comparison results showed that highest mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean squared error (RMSE) were 0.054 and 0.059 m3/m3 for short and long periods, respectively. Even if CLM and AMSR-E had complementary strengths, low MAE (0.018–0.054 m3/m3) and RMSE (0.023–0.059 m3/m3) soil moisture errors for CLM and soil moisture low biases (0.003–0.031 m3/m3) for AMSR-E, care should be taken prior to employing AMSR-E retrieved soil moisture products directly for hydrological application due to its failure to replicate temporal variability.

This paper presents the application of this technique at four sites in southern England over almost 3 years. Results show the soil moisture response to contrasting climatic conditions during 2011–2014 and are the first such field-scale measurements made in the UK. These four sites are prototype stations for a UK COsmic-ray Soil Moisture Observing System, and particular consideration is given to sensor operating conditions in the UK. Comparison of these soil water content observations with the Joint UK Land Environment Simulator 10-cm soil moisture layer shows that these data can be used to test and diagnose model performance and indicate the potential for assimilation of these data into hydro-meteorological models. The application of these large-area soil water content measurements to evaluate remotely sensed soil moisture products is also demonstrated.

A poor nutrient management technique results in an imbalance in the soil nutrient status which could have a long-term negative impact on crop production. The current study was carried out to assess the effect of different rates of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) on soil nutrient balance in a maize-wheat cropping system in Cambisols of Khumaltar, Lalitpur, Nepal during 2019/20 and 2020/21. The experiment included three-factor randomized complete block design with three doses of each N, P, and K which was replicated three times. There was a remarkable change in soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), and total N, P, and K contents of soil over a period of time with the application of different doses of NPK. Soil pH changed from 5.98 to 5.53, SOC increased from 11.7 to 16.8 g·kg−1, total N decreased from 1264 to 1177 mg·kg−1, available P2O5 declined from 214 to 63.6 mg·kg−1, and available K2O decreased from 71.7 to 24.8 mg·kg−1 with varying rates of NPK after four cropping seasons. Furthermore, partial, apparent, and net N, P, K balance were predominantly negative in all the fertilizer treatments, but the magnitude was lower under higher nutrient rates and positive partial N balance was noticed in higher N levels. The depletion of native P and K pools even at higher application rates was attributed to higher crop removal over time as compared to inputs. Therefore, continuous application of balanced fertilizers is crucial in maintaining the fertility of soil and productivity of crops.},

The development of high data storage capabilities also makes this possible over long periods and the relative variations in thermal diffusivity allow the monitoring of the variations in water content. The processing of temperature measurements recorded at different depths is achieved by solving the heat equation, using the finite elements method, with both conductive and convective heat transfers. A first set of measurements has allowed this approach to be validated. Water content variations derived from thermal diffusivity values are in excellent agreement with TDR measurements carried out on the experimental site at Boissy-le-Châtel (Seine et Marne, France).},

Although there are some known measurement limitations for dry soil and sand, a fixed-frequency method is commonly used with commercially available FDR probes. The purpose of our study was to determine if the soil dielectric spectrum could be used to measure changes in θ. A multifrequency FDR probe was constructed with a 6-mm diameter, and a soil dielectric spectrum was obtained. Using the dielectric spectrum, the dielectric dispersion frequency (fd) was determined. It was discovered that changes in fd were highly correlated with changes in θ, and a third-order polynomial equation (R2 = 0.96) was developed describing the relationship. The effectiveness of fd for θ measurement was evaluated for three soils and a sand across a range of θ. The effects of soil temperature and soil salinity were also evaluated. Accurate measurements of θ were obtained even in dry soil and sand. The root mean square error of the θ estimated by the fd measurement was 0.021. The soil temperature and soil salinity had no measureable effects on θ determination. The use of fd for θ determination should be an effective and accurate methodology, especially when dry soils, soil temperature, and/or soil salinity could potentially cause problems with the θ measurements.},

	abstract = {Soil moisture is an important variable in land surface hydrology as it controls the amount of water that infiltrates into the soil and replenishes the water table versus the amount that contributes to surface runoff and to channel flow. However observations of soil moisture at a point scale are very sparse and observing networks are expensive to maintain. Satellite sensors can observe large areas but the spatial resolution of these is dependent on microwave frequency, antenna dimensions, and height above the earth’s surface. The higher the sensor, the lower the spatial resolution and at low elevations the spacecraft would use more fuel. Higher spatial resolution requires larger diameter antennas that in turn require more fuel to maintain in space. Given these competing issues most passive radiometers have spatial resolutions in 10s of kilometers that are too coarse for catchment hydrology applications. Most local applications require higher-spatial-resolution soil moisture data. Downscaling of the data requires ancillary data and model products, all of which are used here to develop high-spatial-resolution soil moisture for catchment applications in hydrology. In this paper the author will outline and explain the methodology for downscaling passive microwave estimation of soil moisture.},

	abstract = {Summary We evaluated the effects of different methods of installing a capacitance soil moisture sensor on the sensor's output with six soil types and three methods of sensor installation. For Method 1, the sensor was first placed in a container and then buried. For Method 2, the entire sensor (including prongs and circuitry) was inserted into a prepacked soil sample. For Method 3, the sensor prongs were installed directly into a prepacked soil sample, and then soil was placed around the circuitry. The sensor outputs of Method 1 were significantly smaller for the volumetric soil water content (θ) of most of the soil types compared with the sensor outputs of the other two methods. Large differences in sensor outputs were observed in relation to the installation method, which resulted in a large estimation error when using a soil moisture sensor. For example, the difference in θ values calculated by the calibration equation obtained by Methods 1 and 2 was 0.076 m3 m−3, a maximum for the Andisol sample. We observed a significant linear relation between the maximum differences in θ (which might result from the different sensor installation methods) and the coarse pore volume determined from soil water characteristic curves. Compaction around the sensor induced by sensor installation, which might be considerable for soil with many coarse pores, was considered the main reason for an increase in the soil moisture sensor's output value. For the sensor installed by Methods 2 or 3, a second-order polynomial equation could be used to translate sensor output to θ accurately except for soils with {\textgreater} 40\% clay content or very low bulk density. Highlights An appropriate calibration equation is important to monitor soil water content precisely. Effects of different sensor installation methods on calibration equations have not been determined. Method of installation considerably affected output values of a capacitance sensor. Soil compaction by sensor installation increases the sensor output: more so in coarse pore soil.},

	abstract = {Soil water content (SWC) plays a key role in partitioning water and energy fluxes at the land surface and in controlling hydrologic fluxes such as groundwater recharge. Despite the importance of SWC, it is not yet measured in an operational way at larger scales. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of wireless sensor network technology for the near-real-time monitoring of SWC at the field and headwater catchment scales using the recently developed wireless sensor network SoilNet. The forest catchment Wüstebach (∼27 ha) was instrumented with 150 end devices and 600 EC-5 SWC sensors from the ECH2O series by Decagon Devices. In the period between August and November 2009, more than six million SWC measurements were obtained. The observed spatial variability corresponded well with results from previous studies. The very low scattering in the plots of mean SWC against SWC variance indicates that the sensor network data provide a more accurate estimate of SWC variance than discontinuous data from measurement campaigns, due, e.g., to fixed sampling locations and permanently installed sensors. The spatial variability in SWC at the 50-cm depth was significantly lower than at 5 cm, indicating that the longer travel time to this depth reduced the spatial variability of SWC. Topographic features showed the strongest correlation with SWC during dry periods, indicating that the control of topography on the SWC pattern depended on the soil water status. Interpolation results indicated that the high sampling density allowed capture of the key patterns of SWC variation.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas The CS655 measures two-way travel time and attenuation of a low-frequency EM pulse to derive Ka, EC, and SWC. Laboratory and field evaluations for five central Texas soils found the sensor robust but RMSE could be reduced by a soil- or site-specific function. The factory calibration has a cross-over point at Ka ∼15, with low bias below and high bias above. The TxSON network mean was unaffected by calibration but the variance was significantly reduced. Soil moisture sensors infer volumetric soil water content (SWC) from other properties of the bulk porous media. The CS655 water content reflectometer is a relatively new, low-frequency electromagnetic sensor that determines relative permittivity (Ka) using the two-way travel period and voltage attenuation of the applied signal along two 12-cm rods. This measured attenuation is quadratically related to bulk electrical conductivity (EC). Along with an onboard thermistor, the CS655 allows a more robust correction of propagation time and Ka, which its predecessors, the CS615 and CS616, lacked. However, with new sensors it is necessary to quantify their practical accuracy in the field. Here, we present an overview of the CS655 sensor and an evaluation under both laboratory and field conditions, using five surface soils (0–10-cm depth) in the laboratory and gravimetric samples collected in the field. Overall, a site-specific calibration using a two-term linearization of the SWC–Ka function reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) of the factory-derived SWC of 0.073 and 0.043 m3 m−3 during batch and infiltration experiments, respectively, to 0.025 and 0.028 m3 m−3. Results further indicate that a soil-specific calibration additionally reduced the RMSE to {\textless}0.02 m3 m−3. Field evaluation across the Texas Soil Observation Network found that calibration reduced the variance across the network but did not affect the arithmetic mean or the RMSE against gravimetric sampling, which remained ∼0.05 m3 m−3 regardless of the SWC–Ka–EC function applied. At the regional scale, a global calibration is sufficient.},

	abstract = {Abstract The volumetric soil water content (θ) is fundamental to agriculture because its spatiotemporal variation in soil affects the growth of plants. Unfortunately, the universally accepted thermogravimetric method for estimating volumetric soil water content is very labour intensive and time-consuming for use in field-scale monitoring. Electromagnetic (EM) induction instruments have proven to be useful in mapping the spatiotemporal variation of θ. However, depth-specific variation in θ, which is important for irrigation management, has been little explored. The objective of this study was to develop a relationship between θ and estimates of true electrical conductivity (σ) and to use this relationship to develop time-lapse images of soil θ beneath a centre-pivot irrigated alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) crop in San Jacinto, California, USA. We first measured the bulk apparent electrical conductivity (ECa – mS/m) using a DUALEM-421 over a period of 12 days after an irrigation event (i.e. days 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 12). We used EM4Soil to generate EM conductivity images (EMCIs). We used a physical model to estimate θ from σ, accounting for soil tortuosity and pore water salinity, with a cross-validation RMSE of 0.04 cm3/cm3. Testing the scenario where no soil information is available, we used a three-parameter exponential model to relate θ to σ and then to map θ along the transect on different days. The results allowed us to monitor the spatiotemporal variations of θ across the surveyed area, over the 12-day period. In this regard, we were able to map the soil close to field capacity (0.27 cm3/cm3) and approaching permanent wilting point (0.03 cm3/cm3). The time-lapse θ monitoring approach, developed using EMCI, has implications for soil and water use and management and will potentially allow farmers and consultants to identify inefficiencies in water application rates and use. It can also be used as a research tool to potentially assist precision irrigation practices and to test the efficacy of different methods of irrigation in terms of water delivery and efficiency in water use in near real time.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas We present a semiautomated framework for large-scale calibration of capacitance soil moisture sensors. Soil-specific calibrations are needed for accurate moisture measurements in nearly all soil types. Transparent, traceable, and complete uncertainty estimates provided for entire approach. Technological advances have allowed in situ monitoring of soil water content in an automated manner. These advances, along with an increase in large-scale networks monitoring soil water content, stress the need for a robust calibration framework that ensures that soil water content measurements are accurate and reliable. We have developed an approach to make consistent and comparable soil water content sensor calibrations across a continental-scale network in a production framework that incorporates a thorough accounting of uncertainties. More than 150 soil blocks of varying characteristics from 33 locations across the United States were used to generate soil-specific calibration coefficients for a capacitance sensor. We found that the manufacturer's nominal calibration coefficients poorly fit the data for nearly all soil types. This resulted in negative (91\% of samples) and positive (5\% of samples) biases and a mean root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 cm3 cm−3 (1σ) relative to reference standard measurements. We derived soil-specific coefficients, and when used with the manufacturer's nominal function, the biases were corrected and the mean RMSE dropped to ±0.017 cm3 cm−3 (±1σ). A logistic calibration function further reduced the mean RMSE to ±0.016 cm3 cm−3 (±1σ) and increased the range of soil moistures to which the calibration applied by 18\% compared with the manufacturer's function. However, the uncertainty of the reference standard was notable (±0.022 cm3 cm−3), and when propagated in quadrature with RMSE estimates, the combined uncertainty of the calibrated volumetric soil water content values increased to ±0.028 cm3 cm−3 regardless of the calibration function used.},

Although designed for tropical ocean surface wind sensing, the CYGNSS receivers also record GNSS reflections over land. The CYGNSS observations of reflection power are compared to SMAP SM between March 2017 and February 2018. A strong, positive linear relationship exists between changes in CYGNSS reflectivity and changes in SMAP SM, but not between the absolute magnitudes of the two observations. The sensitivity of CYGNSS reflectivity to SM varies spatially and can be used to convert reflectivity to estimates of SM. The unbiased root-mean-square difference between daily averaged CYGNSS-derived SM and SMAP SM is 0.045 cm3/cm3 and is similarly low between CYGNSS and in situ SM. These results show that CYGNSS, and future GNSS reflection missions, could provide global SM observations.},

	abstract = {Time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a well-established electromagnetic technique used to measure soil water content. Time domain reflectometry sensors have been combined with heat pulse sensors to produce thermo-TDR sensors. Thermo-TDR sensors are restricted to having relatively short needles to accurately measure soil thermal properties. Short needle lengths, however, can limit the accuracy of the TDR measurement of soil water content. Frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors are an alternative to TDR sensors that can provide an inexpensive measurement of soil water content. The objective of this study was to determine whether short FDR sensors can accurately measure soil water content. We designed and constructed a short FDR sensor. For four soil types across a range of water contents, temperatures, and salt contents, we measured soil dielectric spectra with the short FDR sensor. A vector network analyzer was used to obtain soil dielectric spectra in the 1-MHz to 3-GHz frequency range. The ideal frequency of a short FDR sensor is the frequency at which the permittivity is not altered by changing temperature or salt content. The 47- to 200-MHz range was an ideal frequency range for measuring soil water content, and 70 MHz was the frequency least influenced by temperature and salt content. The short FDR sensor provided quick, continuous, stable, and cheap measurements of soil water content. Because of the promising performance of the short thermo-FDR sensor in laboratory studies, sensors should be evaluated in future field studies.},

Herein, 22 sensors were tested under different conditions of soil salinity, temperature, organic matter, texture, clay content, bulk density and water content, ranging from normal to extreme. The results indicated that the main issue with this device is that its SWC determinations are only accurate within a limited soil salinity and temperature range. Conversely, the organic matter, texture, clay content and bulk density have no direct impact on the sensors' accuracy. The sensors work best when the soil salinity and temperature are 2.5 dS m−1 and 25 °C, respectively. This sensor can be used appropriately after calibration when the soil salinity and temperatures are within the 1.9–4.0 dS m−1 and 16–30 °C ranges, respectively. When the soil salinity and temperature values are higher or lower than these ranges, the sensors do not work accurately. More investigation is needed to study the effectiveness of the sensors under high values of soil salinity and temperature. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	abstract = {ABSTRACT We explore the viability of electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to quantify soil water content in a full-scale dike model. While ERT is an established method to detect changes in soil water content, the retrieval of two-dimensional water content distributions from surface-based surveys is a much more challenging application. We conducted a series of experiments on a full-scale dike model comprising rainfall and flooding events. The dike was surveyed with an ERT line down the land-side slope and monitored with permanently installed spatial time-domain reflectometry (TDR) cables for comparison. Water content changes were calculated by applying Archie’s equation and agreed well with comparison measurements from spatial TDR measurements. The saturation exponent in Archie’s equation was estimated by combining spatial TDR and ERT measurements and agreed well with literature data of comparable sands. The choice of the inversion type, e.g., time-lapse inversion or least-squares versus robust constraint, as well as the influence of inversion parameters, such as regularization and the choice of convergence criterion, is discussed in the context of an apparent inversion artefact for the rainfall experiment, using forward modelling of synthetic data sets. The results indicate that ERT may be a feasible method to quantify water content changes under certain conditions, provided an initial water content estimate is available.},

	abstract = {Abstract In this study, a soil monitoring system for a hillslope with steep relief and shallow soil depth was designed and installed to represent efficiently the spatial and temporal features of soil moisture. The study was conducted on a mountainous hillslope of the Sulmachun catchment (northeastern South Korea). The positions of soil moisture sensors were determined through a sequential procedure including intensive geomorphologic surveying of the study area, surface and subsurface terrain analysis, and inverse surveying. Using 26 sensors, soil moisture data from 11 locations were measured and recorded at hourly intervals over 380 h from 6 to 22 November 2003. Soil moisture response patterns were captured for a few consecutive rainfall events. The monitoring results are discussed in the context of soil moisture variations with terrain attributes. The immediate recharge and fast recession after a peak are the primary features of soil moisture in the upper zone. Stability and significant storage increase are distinct characteristics of soil moisture in the buffer zone and the flow path zone respectively. Spatial distribution of temporal soil moisture variations can be characterized in terms of recession, stability and recharge depending upon the topographic classification of a hillslope for this approach.

Volumetric soil water at a 5 cm depth was measured by time domain reflectometry and was collected in conjunction with spectral radiance measurements obtained using a fiber optic spectrometer. Volumetric soil water content was best predicted with partial least squares regression analysis of creeping bentgrass canopy reflectance data with a maximum r2 of 0.64 (P {\textless} 0.001) 1 d before development of drought stress symptoms. Similar results were observed for canopy reflectance data collected from perennial ryegrass plots, indicating that this technology and method of data analysis may be useful in the development of automated turfgrass irrigation management systems.},

	abstract = {Despite numerous applications of time-domain reflectometry (TDR), serious difficulties remain in estimating accurate soil water contents under field conditions, especially in fine-textured soils. We developed a physically based calibration model to predict the frequency- and temperature-dependent complex dielectric response of soils. The model was used to predict frequency-dependent attenuation and a single “effective” frequency approximation of apparent permittivity of the soil. Effective frequency was predicted to decline from 450 to 160 MHz as water contents increased from air dry to saturation. Predicted frequency decline was small for an input bandwidth of 130 MHz, reflecting that modeled polarization mechanisms associated with relaxation frequencies above 100 MHz were responsible for most of the frequency-dependent attenuation. For specific surface areas ranging from 150 to 300 m2 g−1, simulations indicate that ignoring dielectric and conductive losses or the associated decline in effective frequency results in a 5 to 22\% underestimation of the apparent permittivity. Both the power-law and de Loor–Dobson mixing models gave a reasonable approximation to the measured apparent permittivity for a silty clay loam (34\% clay) across the entire water content range. Moreover, the models were able to describe the behavior of apparent permittivity in response to temperature for two soils with contrasting bulk electrical conductivity contributions to losses. These results demonstrate that loss mechanisms and declines in effective frequency need to be considered to accurately predict the soil water content of fine-textured soils.},

A complex dielectric mixing model was calibrated for fine-textured soils (24–45\% clay) and its accuracy was evaluated and compared with empirical calibrations. The Ap and Bt horizons of two soils were packed into columns and adjusted to volumetric water contents (θ) ranging from air dry to near saturation. Travel time and bulk electrical conductivity (σ0) were measured using TDR at temperatures (T) of 8, 22, and 40°C and using three coaxial cables to obtain a range of input spectrum bandwidths (ωS). Apparent permittivities (Ka) were predicted using the complex permittivity model with measured θ, T, σ0, ωS, and soil bulk density, and fitted to measured Ka by optimizing specific surface area (As), the power-law exponent (a), and an empirical polarization loss factor. Measured Ka was best approximated using the power-law dielectric mixing model with a semiempirical effective frequency estimate and a = 0.68. Predicted As increased with increasing clay content, cation exchange capacity, and measured specific surface areas. The two-parameter power-law calibration removed temperature bias in θ estimates and reduced the RMSE in θ estimates by an average of 0.006 m3 m−3 compared with an empirical calibration. Empirical models predicted field θ with oscillations of up to 0.022 m3 m−3 in phase with soil temperatures resulting from permittivity temperature dependencies. In contrast, the calibrated dielectric mixing model removed or dampened in-phase θ fluctuations to {\textless}0.004 m3 m−3, which permitted the detection of more subtle changes ({\textless}0.02 m3 m−3) in θ.},

	abstract = {Core Ideas Six methods to obtain soil water content by single probe are presented and compared. Errors of estimated soil water content by six methods increase with water content. Heating duration affects soil water content estimation errors. Four of the six methods are probe dependent but can be easily calibrated. Each method works for some soils, and combining different methods is a solution. The estimation of soil thermal conductivity (λ) using the single-probe heat pulse (SPHP) method is well known, but estimation of soil water content (θ) using the SPHP is poorly understood. In this study, we examined six methods—λ, normalized cumulative temperature increase (TNcum), normalized maximum temperature increase (TNmax), and the reciprocals of each—for θ estimation using the SPHP. The temperature response curves of four soils at different θ were measured following 600-s heat pulses with heating strengths of about 6 W m−1, from which λ, TNcum, and TNmax values were determined. The maximum measurement errors of these three methods were 0.11 m3 m−3 for the coarse sand and 0.01 m3 m−3 for the fine sand, sandy loam, and silty clay, except for 0.05 m3 m−3 for the fine sand by the λ(θ) method. The predicted θ from all of the λ, TNcum, and TNmax methods agreed well with that from the oven-dry method for all soils with the exception of the TNcum(θ) and TNmax(θ) methods for the coarse sand for θ {\textgreater} 0.20 m3 m−3. The measurement errors and θ predictions of the 1/λ(θ) method were similar to that of the TNcum(θ) and TNmax(θ) methods, and that of the 1/TNcum(θ) and 1/TNmax(θ) methods were similar to that of the λ(θ) method. Because each of the six methods worked well for only some soils, improved estimations were obtained when the λ(θ) method was combined with the 1/TNcum(θ) [or 1/TNmax(θ)] method for coarse-textured soils and the 1/λ(θ) method was combined with the TNcum(θ) [or TNmax(θ)] method for fine-textured soils.},
